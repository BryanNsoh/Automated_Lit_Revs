    \ paper came from the developing countries where the economy is mostly dependent\
    \ on agriculture\nand climate conditions. Based on current conditions and historical\
    \ records, proﬁtability in production farming depends on\nmaking a right and timely\
    \ operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program designed to\
    \ maximize the productivity\nof agriculture by carefully tailoring the soil and\
    \ crop management to meet the speciﬁc requirements in each ﬁeld while preserving\n\
    environmental quality. Tis review paper highlights the development of an automated\
    \ irrigation system with portable wireless\nsensor networks and decision support\
    \ methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ Radio\nsatellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and\
    \ microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as\nsoil moisture, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and light intensity. Te knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred\
    \ directly to the\ncloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in\
    \ the world can display them through an internet-enabled device.\nDevelopment\
    \ of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it cost-eﬀective and\
    \ potentially productive and increases\nthe eﬃciency through precision agriculture\
    \ farming. Diﬀerent limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed\n\
    publications like the shortage of power in the ﬁeld that can be solved by using\
    \ a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same\ntime using electricity.\
    \ Bluetooth application in the agriculture sector is mainly improved by design\
    \ system optimization. Problems\nrelated to transmission and radio range frequency\
    \ can be solved by using a power class upgraded antenna.\n1. Introduction\nHuman\
    \ civilization around the globe is preparing for a\npopulation explosion to hit\
    \ a total of 10 billion inhabitants by\n2050 (United Nations, 2017). It has been\
    \ estimated that global\nfood production must increase by least 70% over the coming\n\
    years to keep pace with this growth [1–3]. Over the years,\nagricultural methods\
    \ have not improved much, and farmers\nstill use conventional strategies based\
    \ on expectations of the\ncrop’s nutritional needs. Delivering the same nutrient\
    \ input\nacross the entire farm is no longer the best choice, as this leads\n\
    to heavy fertilizer and pesticide usage, unnecessary water\nconsumption,\nenvironmental\n\
    degradation,\nand\nhigh\noperating costs [4, 5]. Extensive irrigation consumes\
    \ ap-\nproximately 70% of global water [6]. Te industrial and\ndomestic sectors\
    \ account for 13% and 20%, respectively, al-\nthough this variation in percentage\
    \ is considerable variation\nacross countries. According to the Act 1947, it deﬁnes\
    \ ag-\nriculture, including livestock’s breeding, dairy farming,\nhorticulture,\
    \ seed growing, and fruit growing [7]. Agriculture\naims to utilize maximum land\
    \ and increase the proﬁt. Te\nagricultural sector needs to adopt smarter methods\
    \ of\nfarming. Innovative techniques in agriculture, such as pre-\ncision farming\
    \ techniques, help with these concerns. Precision\nfarming is a farm management\
    \ method that uses information\ntechnology to eﬃciently distribute resources and\
    \ ensure that\nHindawi\nAdvances in Meteorology\nVolume 2020, Article ID 8396164,\
    \ 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8396164\nthe crops and soil receive the\
    \ exact nutrients needed at the\nperfect time for enhanced health and productivity\
    \ [8]. In\nrecent years, the researchers have tried to develop automated\ncontrol\
    \ irrigation systems for irrigation management by using\ncloud computing and IoT\
    \ technology; IoT can be charac-\nterized as a network of independent objects\
    \ that link and\nshare data remotely over the Internet [9, 10]. Te gap between\n\
    supply and demand is rising and sets new challenges adding\npressure on the agriculture\
    \ supply chain [11]. Traditionally\navailable techniques for irrigation are drip\
    \ irrigation, ditch\nirrigation, sprinkler systems, and terraced systems. Te\n\
    standard irrigation practices are classiﬁed by demand increase\nfor productivity,\
    \ shortage of water, and poor performance for\nagriculture practice. Tese problems\
    \ are solved by using\nautomated irrigation systems.\n1.1. Need for Automatic\
    \ Irrigation\n(i) Saving energy and resources for utilizing in a precise\nway.\n\
    (ii) Easily installation of the system on the ﬁeld.\n(iii) To apply the right\
    \ amount of water at the right time\nfor the sake of farmer’s easiness to control\
    \ farm\nirrigation and nursery.\n(iv) Valves are used in automated irrigation\
    \ systems to\nturn on/oﬀ the motor.\n(v) Pump or motor can be easily operated\
    \ with a sensor-\nbased controller and no need for any labor to\nmanage or monitor\
    \ irrigation systems. Crop eﬃ-\nciency includes improvement in the reduction of\
    \ the\noverwatering from the saturated soil and avoiding\nthe wrong time of irrigation\
    \ to save more water.\nA signiﬁcant part of freshwater is consumed in the\nagricultural\
    \ sector due to the unavailability of cost-eﬀective\nirrigation systems [12–14].\
    \ Fortunately, previous imple-\nmentations of agricultural monitoring systems\
    \ for irrigation\npractices were riddled with problems that prevented the\nprogress\
    \ of this sector. Previously, farm surveillance systems\ncomprised of a wired\
    \ data collection system in which a data\ntransmission linked the sensor units\
    \ with monitoring sta-\ntions [13, 15, 16]. Rainfall and evapotranspiration is\
    \ an\nimportant factor which inﬂuences the moisture of the soil in\nclimatology\
    \ and geography soil wetness measured by the\nproportion of monthly (or annual)\
    \ evaporation and pre-\ncipitation. Soil moisture daily can also be calculated\
    \ by the\nratio of daily evaporation and precipitation in the above\nperspective\
    \ from the routine weather reports precipitation is\ndirectly accessible, and\
    \ evaporation is derived from other\nmetrological essentials [17]. Heterogeneous\
    \ systems are used\nto gather information at a higher level; smart algorithms\
    \ can\nbe organized for evaluating scientiﬁc knowledge to provide\nan enhanced\
    \ understanding of the ongoing processes\n[18, 19]. For sensors-based irrigation,\
    \ diﬀerent terminolo-\ngies are used, i.e., Precision Farming, Variable Rate Tech-\n\
    nology (VRT), Smart Agriculture, Global Positioning\nService (GPS), and Site-Speciﬁc\
    \ Crop Management. [20].\nNowadays, sensors can be used in the domain of human\
    \ life\ndue to its modern technology and small size. Due to the\nconsequence of\
    \ this technology, numerous problems asso-\nciated with sensor networking are\
    \ in research. Low memory,\nenergy constraint, and data security are some of the\
    \ sig-\nniﬁcant issues of sensor networks in which diﬀerent re-\nsearchers in\
    \ the world are trying to solve these issues [21, 22].\nTis review is proposed\
    \ to support aggressive water man-\nagement for agricultural land. It aims to\
    \ explain the diﬀerent\nmodern and sensor-based irrigation management tech-\n\
    niques and track environmental parameters in the ﬁeld of\nagriculture and provide\
    \ warnings and information on\ncurrent conditions to ﬁeld managers while saving\
    \ data for\nfuture reference in a database, which includes information\ncollecting\
    \ using remote sensor collection, wireless sensor\nnetwork, target controlling,\
    \ and data management scheme\nas shown in Figure 1. Tis review paper is based\
    \ on sensor-\nbased irrigation systems and modern technologies in the\nprevious\
    \ works; this study will be helpful to new researchers\nin this ﬁeld to get more\
    \ knowledge and provide more up to\ndate and ﬁll the gap through this review study.\n\
    2. Related Work\nAn automatic sprinkler is a new irrigation technique of\nmodern\
    \ agriculture, but until now, it is not entirely accepted\namong the farmers.\
    \ Mostly, it is practiced by the researchers\nfor performing the experimental\
    \ studies. Wireless sensor\nnetwork (WSN) is conceived as a new concept in agricultural\n\
    applies, which encouraged many scholars to accomplish\nresearch in this zone.\
    \ Recent developments in wireless\nsensor network (WSN) technologies have enabled\
    \ wired\nsensor systems to solve speciﬁc problems [23–26]. Recent\ndevelopments\
    \ in wireless sensor network (WSN) technol-\nogies have enabled wired sensor systems\
    \ to solve particular\nproblems [27–29]. Tis segment is mainly focusing on how\n\
    diﬀerent researchers used WSN systems to support agri-\ncultural practices and\
    \ irrigation. Abbas et al. have developed\na smart sensor-based system for parks\
    \ and gardens that\nmake use of diﬀerent modern sensors. In this system, the\n\
    latest soil moisture sensors are used to sense the ﬁeld\nmoisture as well as diﬀerent\
    \ soil characteristics such as water\nholding capacity [30]. Te main aim of this\
    \ system is to\ncalculate the time that is taken by the sensors to get activated\n\
    and distinguished the irrigation zone. ZigBee is used to make\na connection between\
    \ sensor nodes and wireless-based\nstations. Tis system has four signiﬁcant portions,\
    \ i.e.,\ncontrol unit, water controller, security systems, and mobile\nmessaging\
    \ unit [31]. Te primary function of the water\ncontroller is to identify the level\
    \ of water in the ﬁeld and to\nrepresent the microcontroller. Output functions\
    \ of water\nsensors are to switch the microcontrollers and automatically\nturn\
    \ on or turn oﬀ the pump mechanism. If the farm is\nsubmerged, then the controller\
    \ is automatically turned on\nthe pump that takes out additional water from the\
    \ ﬁeld.\nSecurity systems and password protection were used to\ncontrol unit and\
    \ pumps from unauthorized access. Water is\nbeing applied through proper network\
    \ systems that involve\npipes, pumps, valves, and sprinklers. Irrigation sprinklers\n\
    can also be used for industrial, commercial, residential, and\n2\nAdvances in\
    \ Meteorology\nagricultural purposes. Moreover, several studies considered\nsensor-based\
    \ irrigation is a modern-day irrigation activity\nthat is practiced in a large\
    \ area under entire controlled-\nconditions, as it could eliminate the external\
    \ environmental\nfactors compared with the traditional irrigation activities.\
    \ Te\nGSM sensor-based irrigation control system with a gun\nsprinkler was declared\
    \ in [32–34] with rain gun systems\noperated with the automatic microcontroller\
    \ for crops re-\nquiring a more signiﬁcant amount of water in the ﬁeld. Cell\n\
    phone applications play a fundamental part in the multiple\nneeds of humans. GPRS\
    \ feature in the mobile phone appli-\ncation is used for irrigation control systems,\
    \ but these systems\nare not economical and cover less range of agricultural land.\n\
    Te methods used GSM feature and the android app for\nsending a message to farmers\
    \ and notify them about over-\nirrigation and under irrigation that causes losses,\
    \ leaching the\nnutrient content of soil [35, 36]. Satellite communication\nschemes\
    \ are widely used or prefer where topography dif-\nference is signiﬁcant, and\
    \ cell phone service is not reachable\n[37, 38]. Radio systems with certiﬁed power\
    \ (e.g., 5–10 W)\nwith modems are also a good option but aﬀected by topo-\ngraphic\
    \ hindrance. For radiofrequency, repeater stations may\nbecome too costly when\
    \ there is communication over a\nsigniﬁcant distance and diﬀerent topography.\
    \ Te central\naspect of this technology is to develop decision support\nsystems\
    \ based on ﬁeld-speciﬁc information that exploits the\nchemical or applied water\
    \ concentration [39]. Lamb et al.\ndeveloped a system which is operated by photovoltaic\
    \ irri-\ngation to enhance water depletion by using temperature\nsensors and moisture\
    \ sensors [40].\n2.1. Soil Evaporation Model [41, 42]. For proper irrigation\n\
    management, prediction of soil moisture plays a vital role.\nTe Penmen method\
    \ was considered to get the possible\naccurate results with a minimum error related\
    \ with living\ngrass reference crop. It was observed that the pan method\nwould\
    \ give us acceptable accuracy dependent on the position\nof the land. Te FAO Penman–Monteith\

    measurement\nmethod\nwas\nestablished on neurofuzzy (NF) inference and originated\n\
    that the NF model (depended on relative humidity, solar\nradioactivity, and air\
    \ temperature) shows better precision\nover the combination of air temperature,\
    \ wind speed, and\nsolar radiation [45]. Soil moisture has been predicted from\n\
    the weather forecast sensors placed at the farm. Te soil\nmoisture evaporation\
    \ depends on air relative humidity, air\ntemperature, radiation, and temperature\
    \ of the soil [46]. A\nsensor-based and IoTconstructed architecture (Figure 2)\
    \ has\nbeen developed for collecting, processing, and transmitting\nthe diﬀerent\
    \ physical parameters (air temperature, air rel-\native humidity, soil moisture\
    \ soil temperature, and radia-\ntion) of the farmland related to weather forecast\
    \ information\nfor making eﬃcient irrigation.\nTe system comprises two main components,\
    \ i.e.,\nWireless Information Unit (WIU) and Wireless Sensor Unit\n(WSU). Te sensor\
    \ units have diﬀerent types of sensors to\nsense the soil temperature and soil\
    \ moisture, and the main\nmicrocontroller received sensed data and optimized it.\n\
    ZigBee is used to send data to WIU. Such WSN networks\nalso added a small transmission\
    \ spectrum and high network\ncosts [47–49]. Data acquisition structures are developed\
    \ to\nbe used in environmental compliance along with green-\nhouses or food factories\
    \ and lack of solidity to be used\noutside\nfor\nprolonged\nperiods.\nVishwakarma\n\
    and\nChoudhary developed another option for irrigation systems\noperated with\
    \ SMS facilities, and farmers received a text to\nmobile phones. Tis system incessantly\
    \ observes the irri-\ngation pump and electric motor and aware the farmers by\n\
    sending an SMS to the mobile telephone representing the\naccessibility of power\
    \ supply to the motor. Te farmer selects to\nturn oﬀ and on the electric motor\
    \ by sending an SMS to the\nsensor-based systems that are installed on the ﬁeld,\
    \ and net-\nworks can act according to the programming command as\nreceived in\
    \ SMS; the farmers are also able to set the timer\naccording to their need to\
    \ turn oﬀ the motor automatically [50].\n3. Remote Sensing in Modern Irrigation\n\
    Remote sensing is the latest technique for collecting data\nthrough diﬀerent satellite\
    \ sensor technologies. Tis tech-\nnique involves very close examination of vast\
    \ land set images\nand photos that are captured by aerial photographs which\n\
    are followed by an interpretation, identiﬁcation, and map-\nping of diﬀerent agricultural\
    \ resources and various water\ndata that are connected with forest, water bodies,\
    \ villages,\nroads, crop area, soil, and land types. Troughout the ag-\nricultural\
    \ ﬁeld, optical or visual RS is one of the most often\nexploited in remote sensing.\
    \ Tis uses various bands, i.e.,\nNIR and SWIR sensors, to collect images from\
    \ Earth surfaces\nby reﬂecting features from the surface of the target area [51].\n\
    Termal sensors are often used to measure surface tem-\nperature and have detected\
    \ rapid response variables to track\ncrop health and crop stress [52, 53]. Termal\
    \ remote sensing\nis a process of monitoring radiation emitted from the surface\n\
    of the object and transmits it to temperature without cre-\nating any contact\
    \ with the object. All surface objects emit\nradiation above the temperature of\
    \ °K or 273°C [54]. Te\nabsorption intensity of each object depends on the tem-\n\
    perature; the higher the temperature, the greater the in-\ntensity of the radiation.\
    \ Termal remote sensing provides us\nwith substantial temperature and energy transfer\
    \ from the\nearth’s surface, which is essential to assume the processes\nand responses\
    \ of the landscape [55, 56]. For many agri-\nculture application series of airborne\
    \ thermal sensors, the\nsatellite uses directly or indirectly, as shown in Table\
    \ 1.\nTese remote sensing and agrometrological station data\nare very useful to\
    \ improve the actual crop yield estimation\nand involve in the development of\
    \ crop growth and yield\nmodels. Soil moisture conditions also play a vital role\
    \ in both\nrainfed and irrigated conditions. Tus, monitoring the\nmoisture of\
    \ the soil condition status using remote sensing\ndata would be very impressive\
    \ and useful to judge the actual\ncrop condition in advance and provide valuable\
    \ suggestions\nto farmers for their pesticide application, water-saving ir-\n\
    rigation, and postponding fertilizer.\n3.1. Why Sensors in Sprinkler Irrigation.\
    \ Sensors are used in\nsprinkler irrigation to get information about real-time\n\
    physical and environmental characteristics, and they are also\nemployed to acquire\
    \ feedback and have regulators over the\ncurrent situation. Te sensors accumulated\
    \ information to\nidentify the current object, people, location, and conditions\n\
    known as context [57, 58].\nTe agriculture sector carries numerous requirements\n\
    through sensors that are as follows:\n(i) Monitoring of distributed land\n(ii)\
    \ Collecting soil, crop, and weather information\n(iii) Multiple crops in a signal\
    \ piece of land\n(iv) Fertilizer and water requirement of diﬀerent ir-\nregular\
    \ lands\n(v) Protective solution rather than the sensitive solution\nDiﬀerent\
    \ sensors that are mainly used to collect the data\nfor agricultural-related practices\
    \ and acquisition for soil,\nplant, and weather are discussed in Tables 2–4.\n\
    3.2. Use of Sensors in Modern Irrigation. Application of\nsensor is attractive\
    \ in every ﬁeld of life due to the novelty of\nthis technology and size reduction;\
    \ the ability of the sensor is\n4\nAdvances in Meteorology\nto measure the physical\
    \ characteristics and change them in\nto signal for an observer. Trough speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation man-\nagement techniques, producers can maximize their yield by\n\
    saving a large amount of water. Site-speciﬁc irrigation\ncontrol systems are facing\
    \ many challenges nowadays in\nterms of designing software, uniﬁed combination\
    \ of sensors,\ndata interface, and communication protocol [59]. Solar\npanels\
    \ and electric power are a signiﬁcant consideration.\nMany researchers are trying\
    \ to address the diﬀerent issues\nrelated to irrigation control and interfacing\
    \ sensors by using\nTable 1: Satellite and airborne thermal infrared sensors attached\

    \ autonomous control system for the greenhouse [60],\nwhich depends on PC-based\
    \ dataset and linked with the base\nstation at the same time. Te component of\
    \ the based station\nis an actuator, GSM module, sensors, and microcontroller.\n\
    Te GSM module plays a vital role in the base station to send\nand receive messages\
    \ from central stations. Various tech-\nniques can be used to calculate the soil\
    \ moisture (in the\ngravimetric and volumetric forms), which are further\nclassiﬁed\
    \ into modern and classical procedures for both\nlaboratory and in situ measurements.\
    \ Te conventional\ntechniques to calculate the moisture in soil include tensi-\n\
    ometers methods, thermogravimetric, gypsum block, and\ncalcium carbide neutron\
    \ scattering [61]. While for modern\ntechniques, diﬀerent latest dielectric technologies\
    \ and in-\nfrared moisture balance such as heat ﬂux moisture sensors,\ntime domain\
    \ reﬂectometry (TDR), capacitance and optical\nmethod, frequency domain reﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR), and\nmicroelectromechanical systems are used [62, 63]. Radio\ntransmission\
    \ wireless systems were used to transfer soil\nmoisture data from data loggers\
    \ to an essential data logging\nsite where decisions are made and physically improved\
    \ [64].\nFigure 3 describes the practical approaches of the wireless\nsensor network\

    \ for their area to get better management practices\nand crop yield. By utilizing\
    \ this information, farmers can get\nupdates about the farmland and nursery and\

    \ manager to maintain the moisture level concerning\ntime. Some studies proved\
    \ that if we apply the water at the\nright time and right amount, the productions\
    \ can be in-\ncreased up to 25% to 30% [65, 66].\n3.3. Wireless Signal Communication\
    \ in Irrigation Systems.\nVarious designs and architectures were proposed for\
    \ plug-\nand-play technology to measure the soil moisture and de-\nvelop the sprinkler\
    \ valve controller for site-speciﬁc irrigation\nautomation and management through\
    \ distributed sensor\nnetwork. Wall et al. stated that data arrangement and control\n\
    management are the most eﬀective techniques to manage all\nthe data using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers. However, it is\nchallenging to set the sensing stations on\
    \ the ﬁeld to connect\nbase stations with wires because of station maintenance,\n\
    labor cost, and considerable distance, especially more than\n10 m. Wires systems\
    \ are not very much feasible because\ncables are damaged by farm equipment and\
    \ animals. Tat is\nwhy wireless networks develop grate intentions nowadays\nand\
    \ avoid many of these problems and provide easy re-\nplacement of broadcast stations.\
    \ Diﬀerent wireless tech-\nnologies are often used in much sensor-based research\
    \ work,\ni.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee [68]. A detailed assess-\nment of\
    \ diﬀerent sensor-based technology is discussed in\nTable 5. ZigBee wireless sensors\
    \ are the low-cost and lower-\npower-consumption technology that is mostly used\
    \ to de-\nvelop the wireless sensor network over diﬀerent techniques.\nIt was\
    \ established in May 2003, and ISM (industrial scientiﬁc\nand medical) bands are\
    \ used to operate, i.e., 2.4 GHz,\nglobally.\nFor integrating sensors and actuators,\
    \ there are some\ncontrol standards for RS485 (current based) and RS232\n(voltage\
    \ base) wireless protocol that have been widely ap-\nplied and well documented\
    \ in some industrial application.\nBluetooth and ZigBee (IEEE 802.11 standards)\
    \ are designed\nfor radio frequency of cell phone applications that require\n\
    insuﬃcient data, proper network security, and long battery\nlife [69]. Kim et\
    \ al. stated that ZigBee is a low-cost wireless\nnetworking system with advanced\
    \ features; they provide\nhigh reliability due to its direct-sequence (DS/SS)\
    \ and mesh\nnetworking systems. ZigBee technology is cheaper and re-\nliable than\
    \ Bluetooth, and it can also be used to ensure the\nintegrity and to avoid interference.\
    \ ZigBee not only requires\ndeﬁcient power than Bluetooth but can also transmit\
    \ ef-\nfectively over less distance (e.g., 30 m). Advanced wireless\ntransmitters\
    \ are accessible that are operated with Bluetooth\nand communicate up to 1 km.\
    \ Mostly in the agriculture\nsector, these types of wireless technologies are\
    \ connected to\ncontrol and sense the ﬁeld condition [70, 71].\n4. Description\
    \ of the Data Acquisition\nSystem for the Specific Field\nA total of three sensors,\
    \ including a air temperature and\nhumidity sensor, a light intensity sensor,\
    \ and a soil moisture\nsensor, were used for the assessment of any particular\
    \ area to\ncapture four environmental parameters, namely, tempera-\nture, humidity,\
    \ surrounding light intensity, and soil mois-\nture content. Te data collection\
    \ method provides the\nopportunity to assess the ecological conditions in the\
    \ ag-\nricultural sector accurately. Also, the system’s versatility\nallows additional\
    \ monitors, including a pH sensor, to esti-\nmate plant nutrients, a UV sensor\
    \ to determine ultraviolet\nlight intensity, greenhouse gases and pressure sensor\
    \ to track\nthe ambient air composition, a rain sensor is used to detect\nrainy\
    \ weather, and a water level sensors used to identify\nﬂood in the region, and\
    \ these are included in the system\naccording to client requirement. Te module\
    \ was used to\nread the surrounding environment captured by the sensors\nand process\
    \ the data, and wireless communication transmits\nthe data to the cloud server\
    \ over the network system. Vital\ninformation from all agricultural ﬁelds was\
    \ gathered and\nRemote users\nInternet\nLocal user\nSink\nStorage\nSensor ﬁeld\n\

    \ shown in Figure 4. Te\nirrigation surveillance system established for this assessment\n\
    is cost-eﬀective and highly interactive and can be easily\nadapted to any agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld using the plug-and-play\ntechnique. Tis system is also operated by solar\
    \ energy,\nrendering individual data acquisition units entirely wireless\nand\
    \ portable, thus eliminating the need for cabling for power\nsupply and data transmission,\
    \ leading to reduce installation,\nmaintenance, and relocation costs.\n4.1. On-Site\
    \ and Functionality Analysis. Te sprinkler irri-\ngation system was designed for\
    \ wheat crop for an area of 1\nacre. Te total area was divided into four plots,\
    \ each part\nconsisting of a rain gun. Te device has been tested to ensure\nthat\
    \ environmental data can be collected via sensors; the\ninformation can be transmitted\
    \ to the IoT platform through\nan online website. Te machine has been running\
    \ for a few\nminutes to get several data entries. Sprinkler ﬁeld has been\ndivided\
    \ into four plots, and soil moisture sensors have been\nmounted in each location.\
    \ Tis test was conducted to ensure\nthat the device can perform as required under\
    \ real-world\ndaily usage conditions. Te prototype and layout of the data\nacquisition\
    \ unit were switched on and staked into the\nground of the research ﬁeld, as shown\
    \ in Figure 5. All four\nplots were atomized by connecting them through Wi-Fi\n\
    networking. An on-site website was developed, which gives\nthe current soil moisture\
    \ readings of all the sensors installed\nin the ﬁeld and save the recorded data.\
    \ Sensor stand, board\ncircuits, and continuous electric supply were managed using\n\
    an uninterruptible power supply.\nTe system was able to capture broadcast and\
    \ envi-\nronmental data as designed successfully. Te light intensity\nsensors\
    \ were also closed as the water was poured into the soil\nto simulate a change\
    \ in environmental conditions. Te\ncomputer was able to detect these changes without\
    \ any\nproblems, as shown in Figure 6. All tested ﬁelds were at-\nomized once\
    \ again by connecting them through a Wi-Fi\nnetwork. An on-site website was also\
    \ devolved, which gives\nthe current soil moisture readings of all the sensors\
    \ installed\nin the ﬁeld and saves the recorded data. An account on Ting\nSpeak\
    \ was also made to make graphs of the recorded data.\nSensor stand, board circuits,\
    \ and continuous electric supply\nwere managed using an uninterruptible power\
    \ supply.\nMoreover, one point of contention during the prototype test\nwas the\
    \ wireless connectivity range. As this test was carried\nout by linking a prototype\
    \ signal processing unit to a Wi-Fi\nnetwork established by a Wi-Fi hotspot from\
    \ a cell phone,\nthe device would lose its connection and stop transmitting\n\
    information to the IoT platform if it moved approximately\n5 m apart from the\
    \ user. Tis problem could be overcome by\ninstalling wireless access points (WAPs)\
    \ throughout the ﬁeld\nvia the wireless local area network (WLAN) since this is\
    \ the\nprimary form of wireless connectivity for the full-scale\nimplementation\
    \ of the device. One WAP implementation\nwill provide an enhanced wireless network\
    \ range of up to\n0.5 km. Tis system facilitated to improve the labor eﬃ-\nciency,\
    \ water productivity, and water use eﬃciency in cereal\ncrops (i.e., wheat and\
    \ maize) and saved water about 44% in\nthe case of a sprinkler irrigation system.\
    \ It was also con-\ncluded that 20 feet border treatment was better treatment\n\
    than other treatments as agronomic results were better for\nthis treatment, and\
    \ cutoﬀ distance must be between 60 and\n70 percent of total length. Based on\
    \ wireless sensor network\nsystems, diﬀerent opportunities must have been created\
    \ for\nexisting application areas that require real and remote\nsensing data for\
    \ observing consequences. However, these\ntools have possessed many problems that\
    \ must be solved for\na long-time variability of the proposed system. Diﬀerent\n\
    issues like more energy are required for operating sensors\nnodes, development\
    \ issues containing communication, de-\nployment, and protocols. Te problems in\
    \ wireless networks\nwere discussed in the previous work [22, 72] and have been\n\
    addressed to a solution [73, 74]. Tere are some possibilities\nthat strong wind\
    \ also creates some problem in the sensor so\nthere should be robust ﬁtting around\
    \ the sensors to support\nthe nodes. Te advantages and disadvantages of (WSN)\
    \ in\nsensor-based irrigation are discussed in Table 6.\n4.2. Advantages of Automated\
    \ Sprinkler Irrigation. Te\nprimary objective of automated sprinkler irrigation\
    \ is to\nsupply a minimum amount of irrigation water throughout\nthe ﬁelds. Sensor-based\
    \ irrigation has a signiﬁcant poten-\ntiation to save water and increase economic\
    \ eﬃciencies. Te\nmain advantage of this system is to reduce the input cost or\n\

    9\nto increase the yield for the same input. With this irrigation\ntechnology,\
    \ the human intervention must be minimized.\nWith the automated technology of\
    \ irrigation, human in-\ntervention can be reduced [75, 76]. Some advantages of\
    \ this\ninnovation can be discussed as follows.\n4.2.1. Water-Saving Technology.\
    \ Many researchers have\nbeen reported that the intelligence irrigation method\
    \ is the\nideal possible method of accomplishing signiﬁcant water\nsaving [77].\
    \ Muñoz-Carpena and Dukes stated that sprinkler\nirrigation with sensor applications\
    \ could improved the water\neﬃciency up to 80–90% as against 40–45% in the surface\n\
    irrigation method [78]. Blomquist et al. [62] concluded that\n16% of water could\
    \ be saved in this irrigation practice.\n4.2.2. System Cost. Te irrigation system\
    \ is developed with\nthe module design, which helped a lot to reduce the cost.\
    \ Te\nwireless sensor node and actuator node were about 30 US\ndollars, and the\
    \ portable controller was around $100. Te\ntotal cost to build up a wireless ﬁeld\
    \ irrigation system\ndepended on the planting area, and for a case of 5000 m2,\
    \ it\nwas approximately $500 in terms of hardware cost.\n4.2.3. Proﬁt and Yield.\
    \ Proper timing of irrigation is stated\nto be a critical factor in production\
    \ while delaying irrigation\ncan result in losses of between US$ 62/ha and US$\
    \ 300/ha.\n[79]. El-Kader and El-Basioni conducted an experiment on\n[67] potato\
    \ yield measured in Egypt using sensor-based\nnetwork technology. It has been\
    \ conﬁrmed that yields have\nimproved, and a loss of 2 billion pounds has been\
    \ recovered\nin a year. Due to these reasons, the quality of water used is\nreduced\
    \ and the distribution of water is not optimized.\nFarmers irrigate their ﬁelds\
    \ based on their traditional in-\nformation without worrying about soil moisture\
    \ levels, soil\nquality, crop water requirements, and weather forecasting.\n4.3.\
    \ Control Options of Sprinkler Mechanism. During irri-\ngation, the event control\
    \ system is responsible for regulating\nthe speed of sprinkler systems multiple\
    \ times and also moves\nthe sprinkler position at 360° of the ﬁeld, where the\
    \ rate will\nbe changed and decision about more lees or no irrigation\nwater is\
    \ taken. Tis phenomenon would be used where\ndiﬀerent crops are planted in the\
    \ same ﬁeld [80, 81]. A series\nof the on-oﬀ cycle can be used to accomplish the\
    \ water depth\napplication for the individual sprinkler control system\n[82, 83].\
    \ Adjusting the traveling speed of the center pivot\nsprinkler system is the most\
    \ basic method to measure the\nwater depth against ﬁeld topographic, soil condition,\
    \ and\ndiﬀerent crops. Te primary function of center pivot systems\nis to irrigate\
    \ the land from one point in a circle and work on\nthe diﬀerent topography regions\
    \ having a range in soil\ntextures present under a single machine. So that these\
    \ factors\nare the main reasons to use the controller to manage the\nwater application\
    \ in the ﬁeld based upon the need. Site-\nspeciﬁc irrigation and variable rate\
    \ irrigation are the main\nterms that describe the water applications devises\
    \ in order to\nmaximize the yield and economical value for irrigation water\n\
    applied through diﬀerent moving systems [84, 85]. Chavez\net al. reported that,\
    \ for better performance of remote irri-\ngation systems, control and monitoring\
    \ systems are ﬁxed on\ntwo diﬀerent lined moves. A series of in-ﬁeld and onboard\n\
    wireless sensor networks are used to verify the precision\nirrigation systems\
    \ with high accuracy. Separate nozzle\nregulators were pounded according to sanction\
    \ maps\n[86, 87]. Various manifolds attached with diﬀerent sizes of\nsprinkler\
    \ nozzles should be used for accomplishing and\ncontrolling irrigation water application\
    \ depth to ﬂuctuate\nwater and nitrogen application [88, 89]. Usually, open so-\n\
    lenoids were attached with systems to allow the insurance to\nsupply the irrigation\
    \ water even when control systems failed.\nFor controlling irrigation water application,\
    \ a variable ﬂow\nsprinkler was developed by King and Kincaid [90] and Liu\net\
    \ al. [91]. It used the activated pin, which is operated\nmechanically to regulate\
    \ the oriﬁce area of nozzle and\nmainly it depends on operating pressure, and\
    \ the ﬂow rate of\nthe sprinkler is adjusted within the range of 35% to 100%.\n\
    Hydraulic or electric actuators were used to control the pin.\nTe main problem\
    \ is that the droplet size distribution and\nthe wetted pattern are changed with\
    \ ﬂow rate and create a\nuniformity issue with overlapping of the sprinkler pattern\n\
    [92, 93]. 2-3 manifolds were used in these systems, which\nserve to maintain the\
    \ depth of water and water application\nrate.\n5. Summary and Conclusion\nTe objective\
    \ of this research work was to highlight the\ndevelopment of improved agricultural\
    \ monitoring systems\nthat address problems of existing plans, including price,\n\
    availability, and outdoor accessibility. A simple, low-cost,\nsustainable agricultural\
    \ control system that is extremely\ncustomizable and reliable for outdoor use,\
    \ self-powered to\nreduce the need for long power supply cables, while pro-\n\
    viding better functionality that helps to reduce the agri-\ncultural burden and\
    \ promotes crop yields and income, has\nbeen developed. In semiarid regions of\
    \ emerging countries,\nsmall farmers and marginal farmers (who have land b/w 4\n\
    and 6 hectares) are facing many problems regarding pow-\nered irrigation. Most\
    \ of the time, they are relying on seasonal\nprecipitation for their productivity.\

    has been discussed in this review paper, controlling the\ndiﬀerent irrigation\
    \ management practices by sensing dif-\nferent agriculture parameters such as\

    \ Every aspect of the 21st century has undergone a revolution because of the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT) and smart computing technologies. These technologies are applied\
    \ in many different\nways, from monitoring the state of crops and the moisture\
    \ level of the soil in real-time to using\ndrones to help with chores such as\
    \ spraying pesticides. The extensive integration of both recent\nIT and conventional\
    \ agriculture has brought in the phase of agriculture 4.0, often known as smart\n\
    agriculture. Agriculture intelligence and automation are addressed by smart agriculture.\
    \ However,\nwith the advancement of agriculture brought about by recent digital\
    \ technology, information security\nchallenges cannot be overlooked. The article\
    \ begins by providing an overview of the development of\nagriculture 4.0 with\
    \ pros and cons. This study focused on layered architectural design, identiﬁed\n\
    security issues, and presented security demands and upcoming prospects. In addition\
    \ to that, we\npropose a security architectural framework for agriculture 4.0\
    \ that combines blockchain technology,\nfog computing, and software-deﬁned networking.\
    \ The suggested framework combines Ethereum\nblockchain and software-deﬁned networking\
    \ technologies on an open-source IoT platform. It is then\ntested with three different\
    \ cases under a DDoS attack. The results of the performance analysis show\nthat\
    \ overall, the proposed security framework has performed well.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ blockchain; SDN; precision farming; cyber security; fog computing\n1. Introduction\n\
    Farming is the main source of food and contributes signiﬁcantly to the economy.\n\
    According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),\
    \ by 2050,\nthe demand for producing food must be increased by 70% to satisfy\
    \ the world’s demand.\nIn recent studies, 550 million people of the world’s population\
    \ are in nutrition deﬁciencies;\nevery day, around 820 million people are still\
    \ not obtaining food. The study says that\nthe world’s population will increase\
    \ to more than two billion, and most of the population\nwill live in cities. It\
    \ has also been observed that the population in India and Nigeria will\nincrease\
    \ to around 482 million between 2019 and 2050 [1].\nThe biggest challenging situation\
    \ arises with this population growth to achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) of zero hunger [2]. These projections for the near\nfuture have an impact\
    \ on overall food demand. Because of the scarcity of water today, it is\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757. https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11030757\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n2 of 27\ndifﬁcult to meet only 40% of the water supply\
    \ by 2030, and the unavailability of farming\nland will lead to a reduction in\
    \ the food supply. As a result, the agriculture sector needs\nsufﬁcient resources\
    \ than are presently available, as well as more self-sustaining systems\nto boost\
    \ cultivation percentages while reducing environmental resource use [3]. Though\n\
    it might be appropriate to reach rising demand, it is unclear how to do so in\
    \ an equitable\nand resilient manner. Again, there is a vital need to accelerate\
    \ and scale up the agricultural\nproduction transformation [4]. Agriculture 4.0\
    \ can provide a way to increase agricultural\nefﬁciency with the available crop\
    \ area. It also optimizes irrigation to use limited water and\nenergy and allocate\
    \ resources to protect crops effectively. Those would be possible through\nthe\
    \ integration of environmental monitoring, forecasting, and smart devices [5].\
    \ Smart\nfarming’s new technologies can enhance agricultural mechanisms, allowing\
    \ cultivation\nto increase while using natural resources efﬁciently. Agricultural\
    \ sector innovations are\nreferred to as the “digital agricultural revolution”,\
    \ which turns most factors of agriculture,\nensuing in more effective, efﬁcient,\
    \ self-sustaining, integrated, truthful, and self-reliant\nagriculture. Cellular\
    \ devices, sensors, data analysis, fog computing, information security,\nand intelligent\
    \ systems inﬂuence how technologies are integrated into the agricultural\nsector\
    \ [6].\nNowadays, agriculture is changing quickly as it enters a new age known\
    \ as Agriculture\n4.0. Agriculture 4.0 seeks to employ new technology and approaches\
    \ to address the issues\nfacing modern agriculture (such as climatic alteration,\
    \ illnesses, extreme application of\nresources, etc.) and to lower risks while\
    \ enhancing production efﬁciency and safety [7]. To\ndo this, it makes extensive\
    \ use of cutting-edge ICTs.\nIn addition to this evolution, there is a rising\
    \ trend in food needs. Given the continual\nevolution and the rising need for\
    \ food, it is anticipated that the market for agriculture 4.0\nwill expand greatly\
    \ in the years to come.\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) technologies are\nwidely utilized in Agriculture 4.0 and provide farmers\
    \ with a number of advantages,\nincluding observing numerous environmental factors\
    \ connected to crops, spotting crop\nillnesses, predicting yield, and lowering\
    \ labor costs [8]. However, the Sensor and network\nconnectivity and communications\
    \ in farming might act as a base factor for many types of\nattacks since these\
    \ devices frequently have obsolete or unpatched ﬁrmware or software [9].\nSecurity\
    \ is a top priority in agriculture, and any interruption or distortion may present\n\
    difﬁcult problems and have disastrous outcomes. Monitoring and categorization\
    \ of net-\nwork trafﬁc, which have attracted a lot of attention since the earliest\
    \ beginnings of the\nInternet, can be crucial to preventing network assaults [10].\
    \ Scientiﬁc research on network\ntrafﬁc categorization for IoT system security\
    \ has been extensive. It is an essential part of\nintrusion detection systems\
    \ (IDS) and aids in the identiﬁcation and detection of harmful\nnetwork activity.\n\
    This revolution in agricultural technology is built on having access to all the\
    \ data\nproduced by every sensor used on a farm, centralized via the internet,\
    \ and analyzed for the\nbest possible decision-making [11]. Any sensor employed\
    \ generates a signiﬁcant amount\nof data that can be extensively examined and\
    \ provides useful information to enhance crop\nquality or lessen environmental\
    \ impact. Cloud computing, physical hardware, and the\nIoT are the three key components\
    \ that enable the automation and data sharing needed by\nthis new smart agriculture\
    \ [12]. With the help of technical improvements (drones, sensors,\nsoftware, etc.),\
    \ we can complete agricultural jobs faster and more effectively than humans.\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 must make sure that an appropriate security mechanism is imple-\n\
    mented to avert an attack to build scalable and secure systems. The integrity\
    \ of data is\nimportant for the effective functioning of information technological\
    \ advances such as data\nanalysis and intelligent devices [13]. Because agriculture\
    \ 4.0 incorporates elements from\nconventional Internet, cellular, and wireless\
    \ technologies, which may include all of the\nsecurity risks that advancements\
    \ present situation. It also addresses current security risks\nsuch as data and\
    \ device integrity, consistency, and accessibility. Devices in agriculture 4.0\n\
    are implemented in outdoor spaces where they are subjected to external factors\
    \ such as ani-\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n3 of 27\nmals, human beings, or farming\
    \ equipment. Unknowingly, these factors remove or damage\nsensors. Since the 6th\
    \ century B.C., there has been a threat known as Agro terrorism [5].\nThis type\
    \ of terrorism could have a variety of goals, including causing ﬁnancial harm,\
    \ fear,\nand social unrest [6,7]. Terrorists could incite community disturbance\
    \ and lack of credibility\nin administration by exploiting agricultural and food\
    \ corporate crises, which can lead to\nundivided attention in the world. Cyber-agro-terrorism\
    \ in agriculture 4.0 is an electronic\nsystem in agricultural settings to harm\
    \ crops and animals while causing economic loss.\nCyber-agro-terrorists can operate\
    \ attacks on ﬁelds and through the internet, using cyber\nresources [8].\n2. Overview\

    4 of 27\nAgriculture 1.0: During the conventional agricultural age (1784–1870),\
    \ which was\ndominated by animal and human resources, the fundamental problem\
    \ with agriculture\nwas its lack of operational efﬁciency.\nAgriculture 2.0: During\
    \ the automated agricultural period of the 20th century, resource\nwaste was the\
    \ major problem.\nAgriculture 3.0: During the period of rapid advancement of automated\
    \ agriculture\n(1992–2017), the key problem was the lack of intelligence.\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0: the age of smart agriculture (which began in 2017 and is deﬁned\nby unmanned\
    \ operations) is primarily characterized by the application of contemporary\n\
    information technology to both support and intelligently improve agriculture.\n\
    The term “smart agriculture” [15] refers to a new approach to agriculture that\
    \ per-\nsonalized service through the integration of contemporary information\
    \ technologies such\nas the internet, big data, IoT, and many more [16]. In a\
    \ nutshell, the new mode is an\nintelligent agricultural solution that fuses current\
    \ information technology with agriculture.\nAlthough recent information technology\
    \ opens up new possibilities for the progress of\nagricultural output, it also\
    \ places heavy demands on security and privacy in the context of\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and poses signiﬁcant obstacles therein [17].\nMore than a movement, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 represents the next development in the sector’s\ntransition to a more intelligent,\
    \ effective, and environmentally responsible one. The supply\nchain’s daily operations\
    \ produce a tremendous amount of data [18]. Most of the time, this\ninformation\
    \ went unused, but thanks to big data and new technology, it can now be used\n\
    to boost any crop’s performance and productivity.\n2.1. Advantages of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nThe effects of smart agriculture are covered in the following sections.\n\
    Production volume: The use of smart technology in agriculture can signiﬁcantly\n\
    boost the number of products produced on the farm. This will contribute to feeding\
    \ a\ngrowing population.\nProduction quality: The wellness and nutrition of people\
    \ from all socioeconomic strata\nin the nation can be signiﬁcantly impacted by\
    \ the quality of food produced. A country’s\npopulation will live longer and in\
    \ better health with better food, which will improve its\ncitizens’ economic contribution.\n\
    Effectiveness of farming practices and resource use: The application of smart\
    \ technolo-\ngies to conventional agricultural operations can increase their effectiveness.\
    \ In turn, this\nencourages more efﬁcient use of agricultural resources.\nIdeal\
    \ cost of cultivation: It is achieved when there is a balance between quantity,\
    \ quality,\nand efﬁciency in the procedures used. This results in a higher price\
    \ for the agricultural\noutput that is produced.\nReducing wastage: The farming\
    \ industry, one of the main economic sectors, is in great\npart to blame for the\
    \ massive quantities of food and other secondary resources that are\nwasted. Smart\
    \ technology could be employed to track and cut down on this waste.\nEcologically\
    \ sustainable: The reduced agricultural waste and improved agricultural\nprocess\
    \ efﬁciency directly reduce the environmental and ecological footprint.\nEffective\
    \ use of Time: Timely delivery of the necessary insecticides, fertilizers, and\n\
    other chemicals can provide timely and high-quality agricultural output with fewer\
    \ losses\nthanks to smart agriculture.\nThe farming industry may be at threat\
    \ by the following while deploying agricultural\n4.0 technology:\n•\nTheft of\
    \ business and customer data.\n•\nTaking resources under the control of sensors\
    \ and gadgets.\n•\nDestroying the objects that devices control.\n•\nDamage to\
    \ reputation if a data breach is disclosed.\nAgriculture 4.0 may be at risk from\
    \ infrastructure damage, sensor failures may affect\npoultry and cattle breeding,\
    \ and control system hacks may affect greenhouse farming. All\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n5 of 27\nof these could cause problems or malfunction in agricultural\
    \ operations by harming the\nIoT architecture’s hardware and software. In addition,\
    \ data-collecting technologies face\nchallenges from malicious assaults, unauthorized\
    \ access, privacy breaches, and other issues.\nThe landscape has shifted, with\
    \ AI and ML research concentrating on agro-based\ncontexts, water management,\
    \ livestock, and farmlands. Monitoring, control, and decision-\nmaking alternatives\
    \ in the irrigation ﬁeld repeatedly tried to save water and enhance\nproductivity\
    \ [8–13]. Some research concentrated on plant leaf disease [14], horticulture\
    \ [15],\nvineyards [16], hydroponic [17], alert facilities [18], integration of\
    \ IoT technological innova-\ntions [19], tracking resources [20], and cloud control\
    \ [21].\n2.2. IoT in Agriculture 4.0\nTable 1 lists several well-known uses of\

    \ pest detection and treatment systems: These systems keep an eye out\nfor pest\
    \ infestations, analyze agricultural damage, and incorporate methods to manage\n\
    the infestation.\nIntelligent livestock agriculture: This involves employing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies\nto breed animals and uses precision agriculture to enhance the\
    \ quantity and quality of\nthe produce.\nSmart harvesting system: This system\
    \ harvests a ﬁeld effectively by using IoT-\nbased methods.\nSmart farm management\
    \ system: This kind of technology would aim to offer analytics\non data to increase\
    \ ﬁeld productivity and yield.\nIntelligent groundwater quality management system:\
    \ The ﬁnal product is greatly\ninﬂuenced by the quantity and quality of the groundwater.\
    \ As a result, this system uses\nIoT approaches to maintain appropriate groundwater\
    \ levels.\nThough there are many smart agriculture alternatives, they are still\
    \ underdeveloped\nand offer a low degree of intellect. Many initiatives are limited\
    \ in their automated systems,\nwith the internet of things sending data to the\
    \ base station [53]. There is also no implemen-\ntation with the Internet in several\
    \ cases, except that in a few cases, data is stored in the\ncloud by the local\
    \ systems.\nThe multi-layer architecture of IoT used in agriculture 4.0 consists\
    \ of four layers,\nwhich are the physical layer, network layer, edge layer, and\
    \ application layer. Table 2 below\ngives a detailed description of Resources\

    \ these devices are all implemented in\nthe physical layer, which collects data\
    \ from the farming ﬁeld and digitizes them using\nan Analog to Digital converter\
    \ (ADC). As the equipment at the physical layer does not\ncompute and store the\
    \ data, this needs to connect with the edge layer through the network\nlayer.\
    \ The edge layer includes various resources such as decision-making, gateway,\
    \ data\nﬁlters, data security, and interfaces [55].\nThe advancement of devices\
    \ and technological developments will allow for the in-\ncorporation of more computer\
    \ capabilities into systems. This type of integration aims to\nmeet the various\
    \ needs of agricultural mechanization, farming techniques, and sustainable\nagriculture\
    \ [56,57]. A further issue is data security. This is very important to focus on\n\
    data privacy, the trustworthiness of data, and the correctness of data from generation\
    \ to\ndecision-making.\n2.3. Research Motivation\nThree factors serve as inspiration\
    \ for this article:\n1.\nSmart agriculture is a new paradigm that integrates information\
    \ technology with\nconventional farming as a result of the low productivity of\
    \ traditional agriculture\nand the extensive usage of information technology.\
    \ It has the potential to become the\nnext big thing in agricultural development.\

    \ with physical equipment such as sensors and actuators.\nPhysical devices can\
    \ fail due to unintentional or intentional human behavior, viruses,\nspyware,\
    \ or cyber-attacks. Smart farming applications use a wide range of sensors and\n\
    technologies, and this diversity opens up several security risks, including the\
    \ following:\nRandom device incidents: This is the unintended alteration of physical\
    \ equipment\nthat causes it to deviate from its normal performance. The physical\
    \ equipment may be\ndamaged by farm machinery, causing short- or long-term physical\
    \ damage, as a result,\ngenerates false data and affects data accessibility.\n\
    Mobile node hijacking: It is the theft of farm equipment such as tractors, drones,\
    \ and\nsowing robots. Drones can indeed be pesticides, fertilizers sprinkling\
    \ could be performed\nby Drone, and robots could do weeding detecting disease.\
    \ The intruder may access and\nuse the farm equipment remotely without having\
    \ access permission.\nFake node: An intruder introduces imitation or harmful nodes\
    \ into the automated\nagriculture ﬁeld to disturb the smooth functioning of the\
    \ system [55]. This attack could be\ntriggered by capturing a node and making\
    \ a replica of it. This type of attack typically aims\nto either alter or modify\
    \ data-shuttered devices and applications.\nAbnormal Measurement: It senses unusual\
    \ observations due to data falsiﬁcation,\nenergy exhaustion, radio radiation,\
    \ detection of various connections, extreme storms,\nmalfunctions, or wrong inputs.\
    \ Incorrect data can jeopardize making decisions that result\nin the analysis\
    \ of data will be inaccurate, which minimizes system correctness.\nSleeplessness\
    \ attack: The sleeplessness attack sends a series of seemingly legitimate\nrequests\
    \ in order to keep the devices awake for prolonged life. As a result, the device’s\n\
    battery runs out, and the device stops working [56,57]. When the devices are turned\n\
    off, the observed information is not properly sent, jeopardizing decision-making\
    \ and\nsystem efﬁciency.\n3.2. Security Risks at Network Layer\nThe objective\
    \ of this layer is to send the generated data by the sensors from the physical\n\
    layer to the most trustable computational unit, which is the cloud. The most common\n\
    attacks, which affect the resources used in the network layer, are focused on\
    \ [58,59]. The\nsecurity risks in network layers are:\nDistributed Denial of Service\
    \ (DDoS): It attempts to affect access to service providers\nby overburdening\
    \ the communication link or manipulating protocol ﬂaws, which cause\nresources,\
    \ such as CPU and memory collapse [60].\nDue to resource exhaustion brought on\
    \ by a DDoS attack, the victim server is forced\nto block connections from new\
    \ reliable clients. The victim server’s buffer capacity or\nbandwidth may have\
    \ reached its limit of resources. The overall probability of resource\nscarcity\
    \ at the target end is provided by Equation (1) [15].\nPAttack = 1 − (1 − PBandwidth)\n\
    \01 − Pmemory\n\x01\n(1)\nwhere,\nPAttack: Probability of total attack,\nPBandwidth:\
    \ Probability of Consumption of bandwidth\nPmemory: Probability of Consumption\
    \ of memory\nAttacks on Data Transit: These types of attacks aim to retrieve information\
    \ shared\nbetween network devices in order to obtain conﬁdential information [61].\
    \ An adversary\ncould intercept trafﬁc via malicious routers or man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks [62]. Intercep-\ntion of trafﬁc reveals conﬁdential data such as private\
    \ keys, access credentials, or digital\nsignatures.\nAttacks on Routers: They\
    \ plan to change network routes in order to gain trafﬁc control.\nInimical nodes\
    \ in IoT networks might attempt to reroute communicating paths during the\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757\n10 of 27\nprocess of transmission. As a result of attacks, the\
    \ receiver might receive information lately,\npartially, or incorrectly, or not\
    \ at all [63,64].\nMalware Injection Attacks: The malware injection attack [34],\
    \ in which malware is\ninjected by an attacker into a connected computing device.\
    \ This is a very common attack\non smart farming. Malware is a very signiﬁcant\
    \ threat in distributed projects because it\nautomatically spreads through the\
    \ system, making it an appealing target for intruders.\nMalware damage comes in\
    \ multiple varieties of sizes. Malware can steal data about farm\nmaterial usage,\
    \ buying information for fruits, vegetables, and farm animals, data about\nfarm\
    \ equipment, and so on. It could hire automated devices to form a botnet that\
    \ would be\nused to commit harmful attacks under the inﬂuence of an intruder.\n\
    Botnet: At each architectural layer of the precision farming system, there are\
    \ numer-\nous IoT devices. These machines are vulnerable to attack and could be\
    \ taken over by a\ncentralized malicious system. This results in a ‘Botnet of\
    \ Things’ (BoT) [35]. A mutant farm\nworkforce IoT equipment that is already infected\
    \ [36] is easily used to infect other networks\nvia various communication links,\
    \ and thus automated farming could become an internet of\ndestructibility for\
    \ cyber illegitimates. The security features are not added in many of the\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture devices, but still, they are used frequently for establishing adequate\n\
    data security defensive system frameworks.\n3.3. Security Risks at Edge Layer\n\
    The edge contains important aspects that monitor, and control modules communicate\n\
    with all layers and access resources. The physical layer’s large volumes of data\
    \ can be\nprocessed locally rather than centralized in the cloud. The following\
    \ are major edge\nsecurity issues.\nActuator control Forge: It introduces false\
    \ measures of data into the system in order to\nmanipulate it. Typically, the\
    \ data is received by the gateway in plain text. Corrupted data\nwill lead to\
    \ poor decision-making. An opponent, for example, could inject incorrect soil\n\
    moisture measurements into a smart irrigation system to manipulate it.\nBooting\
    \ Attacks: Devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of security processes\n\
    during boot [37]. Memory cards and ﬂash drive sticks, for example, may detect\
    \ dangerous\ncodes which run at startup [38]. Suspicious booting practices could\
    \ launch numerous\nattacks on the edge with insufﬁcient protection.\nSignature\
    \ wrapping: The attacker modulates the cipher text by inserting a bogus\nelement\
    \ that allows you to perform a random Web Application requisition while identifying\n\
    as an authenticated user [39].\nMeasure infusion Forgery: It is the injection\
    \ of wrong speciﬁcations into a system in\norder to modify it. An attacker sends\
    \ known data patterns through actuators to the cloud\nstorage, which is then injected\
    \ into the system through computational units. Corrupted\ndata could lead to poor\
    \ decision-making.\nUnauthorized access: The process of validating is a critical\
    \ security component. The\nauthentication process is a technology that ensures\
    \ security and privacy, honesty, and\naccessibility [40]. Several agricultural\
    \ practices, however, use gateways with insufﬁcient or\nno access controls.\n\
    Gateway-cloud fabrication: The cloud and the gateway are linked by ISPs or wireless\n\
    connections. A network attacker could fabricate cloud requests by interrogating\
    \ a gateway.\nThe attacker could use these requests to change parameters in precision\
    \ agriculture, control\nqueries for sensitive services, or interpret system equipment.\
    \ The cloud can implement\nsecurity services as it has computational power. In\
    \ order to ensure maximum system\nreliability, these strategies must be incorporated\
    \ into the system.\n3.4. Security Risks at Application Layer\nThis layer provides\
    \ end-user assistance and data to process and make system decisions.\nThis layer’s\
    \ security concerns are application-speciﬁc, focusing on preventing data theft\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n11 of 27\nand ensuring privacy. Some of the attacks that\
    \ might affect cloud services and applications\nare listed below in terms of security.\n\
    Malicious scripts: Malicious scripts can deceive clients, infuse malicious data,\
    \ access\nconﬁdential material, and compromise security features. This type of\
    \ attack is frequently\ncarried out by cybercriminals for speciﬁc, economic, or\
    \ political reasons. They can damage\nor destabilize operational processes by\
    \ using malicious scripts, presenting unnecessary ad\ncampaigns, and stealing\
    \ money [41].\nPhishing: It is an attack that attempts to obtain highly classiﬁed\
    \ personal informa-\ntion, such as an Identity and password, fraudulently. Phishing\
    \ typically targets end-users\nthrough fraud and sites [42]. The attacker also\
    \ affects decision-making and internal opera-\ntions in many cases. The most effective\
    \ protection would be for users to remain vigilant\nwhile surﬁng the web [43].\n\
    Denial of Service (DoS): This threat disrupts service by overburdening trafﬁc\
    \ on the\nnetwork or ﬂooding the provider with repeated attempts [44]. Because\
    \ of ﬂaws in security\nsetup, an attacker can launch this attack from the Web\
    \ or a sub-system.\n4. Security Threats in Modern Agriculture\nFarmers typically\
    \ carry out the developed smart system initiatives in physical ﬁelds\nor green\
    \ ﬁelds. In Agriculture 4.0, most efforts are focused on water processes, disease\n\
    monitoring, seed production, and record keeping. It can be either automatically\
    \ con-\ntrolled or manually controlled. In both cases, the system monitors the\
    \ environment with\nsensors and changes it with actuators. Some initiatives only\
    \ digitize farms, whereas oth-\ners incorporate industry 4.0 or IoT technologies.\
    \ As an immature industry, open-ﬁeld\nagriculture is the focus of this work, with\
    \ security issues restricted to access control and\nweb-encrypted communications.\n\
    It is too difﬁcult to execute different security measures in rural areas since\
    \ there is a\nshortage of modern technical infrastructure and advanced technology.\
    \ Many difﬁculties\ncan arise if security measures are attempted in rural agriculture.\
    \ Table 3 lists a few of the\nsecurity challenges that are prevalent in rural\
    \ locations.\nTable 3. Rural-Agriculture Security Issues.\nRural-Agriculture\n\

    \ less\nHard to identify base station attacks\nRecently most of the agriculture\
    \ 4.0 projects have implemented IoT, but the security\nfeatures in that have become\
    \ disabled by default. It has been introduced that a server con-\ntrols and manages\
    \ these devices remotely via a web application. Opportunistic opponents\ndid not\
    \ know details about security resources. They gain unauthorized access to the\
    \ system,\ninsert fabricated measures, fabricate actuator controls, or report\
    \ earlier attacks to divert\nthe system from its normal functioning [45–64]. The\
    \ author proposed a smart watering\nsystem that remotely controls and observes\
    \ the ﬂow of water in the farm but is not focused\non security risks to detect\
    \ malicious attacks and unallowed access that manipulate the\nmonitored data.\
    \ To monitor the growing environment, ref. [65] introduce a Hydroponic\nFarming\
    \ Ecosystem (HFE). It is automatically controlled, and the client can monitor\
    \ the\nfarming via a web interface. These automated systems require high-security\
    \ concerns to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n12 of 27\ndetect or avoid random sensor\
    \ incidents, weak sensors, wrong data injection, and other\nattacks, which could\
    \ corrupt data and affect system reliability.\nSimilarly, in [66], the author\
    \ focused on creating a system for monitoring ﬁelds based\non humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ light levels, and temperature. Irrigation can be controlled\nmanually or automatically\
    \ via web or mobile systems. An intelligent solution for detecting\ndiseases in\
    \ leaves focused in [67]. By using sensor data and camera images, the system\n\
    identiﬁes leaf diseases. A mobile or web application is used by the end-user to\
    \ interact\nwith the system. This paper does not go into detail about the implementation\
    \ of security.\nSimilarly, ref. [68] proposed an intelligent agricultural system\
    \ for information inter-\nchange among farm equipment. The article discusses the\
    \ system’s construction but makes\nno mention of manual intervention or remote\
    \ control, nor does it concern any security\nchallenges. As this is a data exchange\
    \ system, the DoS attack can affect the network layer.\nRef. [69] provides NETPIE,\
    \ a solution that gives agricultural product information. The\ngrowing environment\
    \ can be controlled and monitored with a set of physical devices. The\ngenerated\
    \ data is analyzed saved in a QR code, and which is then available to the customer.\n\
    NETPIE does not discuss security resources. Ref. [51] Introduced monitoring of\
    \ crop ﬁelds\nand watering using IoT, which measures data and controls data to\
    \ avoid unauthorized\naccess to these data but could not protect the other devices,\
    \ which leads to weak security,\nwhich might result in a major loss. Ref. [52]\
    \ Proposed a system known as SEnviro, which\nobserves the crop ﬁeld and detects\
    \ diseases remotely. This system does not focus on the\nprediction of disease,\
    \ but unauthorized access is controlled here.\nAccording to the relevant literature,\
    \ from a security standpoint, farming equipment\nis used without security features.\
    \ Furthermore, the gateway contains no security infor-\nmation. Transmission privacy\
    \ or device authentication is not presented in any of the\nabove-discussed systems.\
    \ Access control and management and encryption of data need\nto add security technologies\
    \ to Information dissemination. Smart agriculture is currently\na convenient target\
    \ for cyber criminals’ agents. Attacks can be motivated by a variety of\nfactors,\
    \ including an advertisement, intellectual, or even terrorist reasons. Terrorist\
    \ groups,\nfor example, can cause ecological loss to a country, economic chancers\
    \ may take part in\nmarket manipulation, and workers can attack a range of factors\
    \ [53].\n4.1. Data and Device Security Issues and Threats in Agriculture 4.0\n\
    As was previously mentioned, harsh environmental factors that can seriously harm\n\
    electromechanical equipment, such as extreme heat, moisture, moisture, shocks,\
    \ and other\nanomalies, have a direct impact on the agricultural sector [70].\
    \ The majority of these\nsensors are prone to failure, making it feasible for\
    \ them to produce inaccurate data and\ninstructions that could cause a manufacturing\
    \ disaster [71]. Additionally, sensors and\nnetwork equipment are predominance\
    \ reachable. This poses a serious risk to farmlands\nsince anybody with bad intentions\
    \ can access them and corrupt or harm them to cause\nthem to malfunction [72].\n\
    Another potential security concern is the online transfer of the information gathered\n\
    by IoT sensors and other agricultural machines. Major security concern in the\
    \ agriculture\nindustry is security, privacy, and control [73], as farmers may\
    \ incur a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial\nand personal loss in the event of a data breach.\
    \ Ref. [74] Divides the threats to conﬁdentiality\ninto four distinct categories:\n\
    •\nIntentional data theft through smart platforms and applications that do not\
    \ adhere to\nsecurity and privacy standards;\n•\nInternal information thefts from\
    \ a stakeholder in the supply chain intended to harm\nan agri-business or a farmer;\n\
    •\nUnethical data sales intended to reduce proﬁts for farmers or to harm them;\
    \ and\nother threats.\n•\nUnsupervised foreign access to private and sensitive\
    \ information using drones, sensors,\nand cameras with the intention of utilizing\
    \ them to harm farmers or jeopardize public\nsafety [64,75].\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n13 of 27\nEvery application of modern technology, IoT in agriculture,\
    \ carries the aforementioned\ndangers, weaknesses, and threats. A more thorough\
    \ and complex explanation of the risks\nand their sources in aspects of cyberattacks\
    \ in the agro sector is provided in the following\nparagraph, which is primarily\
    \ focused on illegal behavior and exploited vulnerabilities in\nICT systems.\n\
    4.2. Cybercrime and Cybersecurity in Agriculture\nA cyber-attack on an agribusiness\
    \ or food industry is increasingly likely today thanks\nto automation and the\
    \ widespread use of internet-connected equipment, which give poten-\ntial (cyber)\
    \ criminals greater chances in ﬁelds that were previously too remote or difﬁcult\n\
    to physically access [61]. Consequently, a potential cyber-attack or security\
    \ problem in\nan agricultural organization could have serious human or ﬁnancial\
    \ repercussions. This\nimplies that pertinent security concerns brought about\
    \ by the widespread and ongoing\nusage of IoT, as well as the emergence of agro-terrorism,\
    \ require adequate attention, better\nequipment, and solutions [62].\nThe bulk\
    \ of system operations in the agriculture sector are network-based, and fre-\n\
    quently these systems are not protected from cyber threats, which can have substantial\n\
    ﬁnancial and security ramiﬁcations [76–86]. Five important elements, as identiﬁed\
    \ in [87],\nstrengthen these risks in the agricultural sector:\n•\nIncreasing\
    \ the farm consolidation highly depends on technology;\n•\nThe joint ventures\
    \ of the food supply chains, allow manufacturers to conduct processes\nand trade\
    \ products directly;\n•\nFood-related technologies in intelligent markets depend\
    \ on more components, which\nincreases their vulnerability to errors and malfunctions.\n\
    •\nEffective monitoring of food-related systems, social networks, and industries\
    \ in a safe,\ndynamic, and almost real-time manner is lacking, making it difﬁcult\
    \ to identify serious\ndigital and security vulnerabilities that could be the\
    \ root of signiﬁcant data breaches\nand system defects.\nDue to the heightened\
    \ risk of cybercrime, the agriculture sector may be impacted by\nsuch threats\
    \ in a number of ways. Categorize these methods as in [84]. Threats of tampering\n\
    include delivery disruption, conﬁdential information interception, formula modiﬁcation,\n\
    and delivery disruption. These risks are undoubtedly closely related to the adoption\
    \ and\napplication of technological advancements in the agriculture and food sectors.\n\

    [62,79,92,97,98]\n4.3. IoT Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Threats in Agriculture\n\
    IoT is made up of four main systems that make it possible to communicate between\n\
    nodes. Sensing technology, IoT gateways, cloud servers, data storage, and mobile\
    \ appli-\ncations for remote control make up an IoT system. The architectures\
    \ of IoT systems in\nagriculture come with current and new threats and vulnerabilities.\
    \ These ﬂaws can be\nlinked to IoT device hardware and software problems, communication\
    \ protocols, and also\ndata processing and storage solutions (found, for example,\
    \ in cloud infrastructures, data\ncenters, and smartphones) [2,11].\nAccording\
    \ to [99–101], the following is a concise but accurate classiﬁcation of the\n\
    primary causes of low security in the IoT:\n•\nFirmware that is not patched and/or\
    \ default passwords that have been used for a long\ntime allow for device compromise\
    \ in an IoT network.\n•\nBecause of the limited computing power of smart devices\
    \ and vendors’ efforts to\nkeep their prices low in a cutthroat market, it is\
    \ difﬁcult to incorporate complicated\ncryptographic algorithms.\n•\nFlaws in\
    \ the routing protocols used by smart devices (such as Bluetooth and ZigBee);\n\
    •\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol’s outdated, low-security version,\
    \ which is\nfrequently still in use;\n•\nConducting passive vulnerability detection\
    \ using search engines;\n•\nThe risk of assembling millions of smart devices into\
    \ a potent botnet (such as Mirai),\ngiven how simple it is to ﬁnd vulnerabilities\
    \ via internet scanning;\n•\nA general disregard for the security of smart gadgets\n\
    Finally, a variety of criteria can be used to categorize IoT vulnerabilities,\
    \ hazards, and\nthreats. These risks apply to all IoT applications, including\
    \ those in the agricultural sector.\nFirst, internal vs. external risks and passive\
    \ vs. active risks are the two basic classiﬁcation\ngroups of security concerns\
    \ in IoT systems in the agriculture sector [79].\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n15\
    \ of 27\nIoT hazards are categorized in another intriguing way using a layer-based\
    \ system.\nAccording to [22], each of the levels below integrates many technologies\
    \ that could lead\nto a variety of security threats, vulnerabilities, and/or breaches.\
    \ The application layer,\nmiddleware layer, internet layer, access gateway layer,\
    \ and edge technology layer are the\nﬁve main layers that make up the IoT architecture.\n\
    5. Existing Research on Security in Agriculture 4.0\nIn [54], the author states\
    \ that The United States Department of Homeland Security\nissued a report emphasizing\
    \ the signiﬁcance of agriculture 4.0 and the associated internet\nsecurity threat\
    \ and possible attacks.\nThe report emphasizes the information security model\
    \ of conﬁdential information,\ncredibility, and accessibility in farming. The\
    \ researchers of [55] suggested a new access\ncontrol solution that combines session\
    \ keys and public keys to speed up the encrypted\ncommunications tasks. It yields\
    \ quick and lightweight appropriate control measures\nthat are ideal for precision\
    \ agriculture communication. Ref. [56] Proposed a framework\nfor understanding\
    \ vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and their application in an\nintelligent\
    \ farming environment. The goal of the approach is to determine the level to\n\
    which intelligent farming emerging innovations are prone to cyber. It assesses\
    \ the threat\nprediction model using the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).\n\
    Nowadays, The Blockchain is not only used in cryptocurrency but also utilized\
    \ in\nother ﬁelds and different applications such as in the medical sector, agriculture\
    \ sector,\netc. [57–59]. This article concentrated on the application of blockchain\
    \ technology to food\nsafety. For tracking and monitoring the food items and stages\
    \ of production, such as\ncultivation/breeding, raw resources, processing, transporting,\
    \ warehousing, and selling,\nthe author developed a system [60]. In addition,\
    \ the system employs a variety of sensor-\nbased equipment to adopt sustainable\
    \ recording and conﬁrmation with sensor-based\nveriﬁcation. Ref. [61] Proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based easy and simple security framework for\nsmart Greenﬁeld farming.\
    \ Each IoT node can nominate the cluster member’s leader, which\nhelps to avoid\
    \ a hot spot problem if an intruder focuses on the leader node. Furthermore,\n\
    the authors discussed the security risks of their suggested scheme, which adhered\
    \ to the\ntraditional conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability principles.\
    \ Ref. [62] proposed a cost-\neffective IoT-based security monitoring system.\
    \ The physical layer is the primary concern\nof this system of precision agriculture,\
    \ where data are collected from sensors. These data\nare sent to a controller,\
    \ which analyses it to take action, such as activating the actuators for\nwater\
    \ sprinklers on farms. Table 5 describes some of the recent research which has\
    \ already\nbeen performed on security issues related to smart farming.\nGupta,\
    \ M et al. explained [102] the necessity of clouds applied in vehicles in this\
    \ time-\nand location-sensitive context and present an extended access control\
    \ oriented (E-ACO)\narchitecture that is pertinent to IoV. Here, they describe\
    \ using scenarios to highlight access\ncontrol needs in our vision of cloud-assisted\
    \ connected automobiles and vehicular IoT, as\nwell as approaches to various access\
    \ control models that may be applied at different tiers\nof the E-ACO architecture\
    \ and in the authorization framework.\nGupta, M et al. [103], in their work, describe\
    \ an edge infrastructure-based solution to\nV2V and V2I communication that is\
    \ safe and trustworthy in place of direct peer-to-peer\nconnection. To approve,\
    \ check, and verify the authenticity, integrity, and anonymity of\ncommunications\
    \ sent in the system, they add trusted cloudlets in this section. Along with\n\
    a proof of concept implementation of the suggested approach on the AWS IoT platform,\n\
    they also describe a formal attribute-based model for V2V and V2I communication,\
    \ known\nas AB-ITS. This cloudlet-supported architecture supports crucial use\
    \ cases such as an\naccident or ice-threat warning and other safety applications.\
    \ It supplements direct V2V or\nV2I communication.\nSontowski, S. et al. [104]\
    \ presented a DoS attack that can impair a smart farm’s\noperation by interfering\
    \ with the functioning of installed on-ﬁeld sensors. They speciﬁcally\ncovered\
    \ a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack that makes use of ﬂaws in IEEE 802.11, where\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n16 of 27\nthe management packets are not encrypted. A\
    \ development board for the ESP8266 maker\nfocus When a Raspberry Pi is attached,\
    \ WiFi Deauther Monster is used to disconnect it\nfrom the network and stop sensor\
    \ data from being transferred to a distant cloud.\nThe notion of Activity-Centric\
    \ Access Control (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosys-\ntems was ﬁrst proposed\
    \ by Gupta, M. et al. in [105] and discussed in this article as a ﬁrst\nstep.\
    \ Here, they examined the idea of activity with regard to cooperative and dispersed\n\
    yet interconnected systems, identifying the many parties involved as well as the\
    \ crucial\nelements to consider when making an activity control choice. They provide\
    \ an initial\nframework for developing activity control expressions that may be\
    \ used by various smart\nobjects in the system.\nThe biggest obstacle to the growth\
    \ of cloud computing is security worries. Information\nsecurity continues to have\
    \ an impact on the market even though it raises inconveniences\nrelated to information\
    \ security. The threat of security breaches in the cloud infrastructure\nmust\
    \ be understood by clients. Cloud-computing capacity, networking, and computing\n\
    powers are brought to the edge by fog computing. One of the most critical challenges\
    \ with\nfog computing platforms is safety and security. Lightweight devices have\
    \ beneﬁted greatly\nfrom edge computing’s ability to complete difﬁcult tasks quickly,\
    \ but the technology’s hasty\ndevelopment has led to a general disregard for safety\
    \ risks in edge computing stages and\nthe applications they allow.\nIn our proposed\
    \ framework we have focused on the threats in fog computing-based\nIoT environment\
    \ via blockchain for the application in agriculture 4.0.\nTable 5. Related Research\

    \ is to acquire meaningful information from the external\nenvironment via sensors\
    \ to take required action against it. This sensor layer has a variety\nof Sensor\
    \ nodes of various forms and sizes. As a result, they all use the same basic compo-\n\
    nents, such as input and output components, information handling units, communication\n\
    segments, and many more units for the management of power sections. To analyze\
    \ and\nstore all detected data, it is sent to the relevant fog nodes. Furthermore,\
    \ Sensor nodes\nreceive instructions to undertake agricultural operations.\n6.2.\
    \ Fog Computing Layer\nThis layer is made up of multiple fog nodes, which are\
    \ insubstantial equipment that\ncarry out processing, communication, and storing\
    \ tools to do operations that an end device\ncannot perform. Not every piece of\
    \ data that is gathered becomes processed on the cloud.\nRather, this layer hosts\
    \ all authentic analysis and latency-sensitive applications.\nVirtualization:\
    \ Recognizing that conﬁguring several devices, in the same manner,\nmight be time-consuming,\
    \ the nodes can be contained inside a Virtualized environment for\na more pleasant\
    \ setup for all subsequent fog nodes.\nAgricultural Sensor data monitoring: This\
    \ node is going to collect real-time sensing\ndata, analyze it, visualize it,\
    \ manage devices, and store some of it locally. The user can\nobtain information\
    \ from the fog layer while smoothly synchronizing cloud-directed data.\nBlock-chain\
    \ Client software: This consists of a piece of programs that is installed on\n\
    the fog node. Its primary goal is to sync authentic sensitive Sensor data to the\
    \ Blockchain.\nIt is in charge of producing transactions, batching them, and sending\
    \ them to the validator\nso that they can be aggregated into blocks and recorded\
    \ to the Blockchain.\nSimulated Switch: Additionally, this node is used as a transmitting\
    \ device with the\nsupport of virtual switch software, which provides NFV and\
    \ SDN technologies to enhance\nnetwork services by establishing the routing features\
    \ for computational extension and\ncontrol. Some network virtual functions include\
    \ security, quality of service (QoS), and\nautomated control. The main objective\
    \ is to create switching layers for virtual machine\nenvironments while continuing\
    \ to support the OpenFlow protocol [107], which allows this\nnode to interact\
    \ directly with the SDN Controller; an outstanding demonstration of such\nimplementation\
    \ is Open vSwitch, an interactive multilayered software switch.\n6.3. Distributed\
    \ Network Using SDN\nThis network is made up of numerous geologically dispersed\
    \ and SDN controllers\nlinked to it that operates as a common Networking Operating\
    \ System (NOS), combining\nnominally autonomous operations with centralized control\
    \ [108]. The main component of\nan SDN network is the SDN controller. This can\
    \ help with network monitoring by managing\nall transactions among network and\
    \ application devices, allowing it to manage and adjust\nnetwork ﬂows more efﬁciently\
    \ in response to new requirements [109]. It maintains a\nconsistent glimpse of\
    \ the network from afar, delivering data to fog nodes via one APIs and\napplication\
    \ via other APIs (MQTT, CoAP...) [109]. In addition, the SDN controller employs\n\
    a Block-chain contractor to properly secure ﬂow tables of SDN in the Block-chain,\
    \ hence\navoiding rule counterfeit.\n6.4. Block-Chain Based Network\nTo keep all\
    \ the nodes up to date, all Blockchain modules are interconnected and con-\nstantly\
    \ exchange the most updated information in the Blockchain among themselves. Smart\n\
    contracts will trigger and enforce relevant actions based on the data provided,\
    \ allowing\nfor veriﬁable transactions in the Blockchain when such circumstances\
    \ are met without the\nrequirement for third-party involvement [110,111]. The\
    \ Ethereum Blockchain platform\nserves as the foundation for the blockchain network\
    \ architecture because it provides a\nhighly ﬂexible and modular design that separates\
    \ the runtime environment as per the\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n19 of 27\napplication\
    \ domain, permitting agreements to deﬁne the business rules for the application\n\
    that are not necessary for the core system’s fundamental design.\nThe Blockchain\
    \ complete node is made up of the following components:\n1.\nNode for Validation:\
    \ This is a key component that veriﬁes batches of transactions\nbefore combining\
    \ them into blocks. It also ensures that candidate blocks are added to\nthe Blockchain\
    \ version for each node.\n2.\nBlockchain Software: it determines which transactions\
    \ or operations are permitted on\nthe block-chain and contains the following:\n\
    •\nDatabase model: it deﬁnes relevant operations and the description of the transac-\n\
    tion’s payload.\n•\nTransaction Processor: deﬁnes the business logic for different\
    \ applications, vali-\ndates batches of transactions, and modiﬁes the blockchain\
    \ system based on the\napplication’s rules.\n•\nClient: it speciﬁes the service\
    \ client functionality, which the client develops and\ndelivers to the validator.\
    \ The client also shows blockchain information.\n•\nREST API: This protocol is\
    \ used to communicate within the clients and the\ntransactions processing system.\n\
    3.\nDigital Signature: To ensure transaction integrity, the data used in the transactions\
    \ is\nhashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the sender’s secret key to\
    \ produce a\nsignature. The processor then validates the transaction by verifying\
    \ this signature.\n7. Case Studies and Experimental Results\nTo test the security\
    \ framework, we allowed DDoS attacks against the Blockchain\nNetwork. A distributed\
    \ denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targets websites and servers by\ndisrupting\
    \ network services. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application’s resources.\n\

    \ network packets received by the Blockchain per minute. \n• \nThe number of transactions\
    \ published in the Blockchain network. \nThe results are shown in Figures 7 and\

    Therefore, the Agriculture 4.0 scenario is particularly well adapted to 5G technol-\n\
    ogy [112–114]. A framework for the digitization of agriculture networks and function\n\
    modules for an intelligent irrigation system was provided by Meng and Cheng [115].\
    \ Tao\nand Donglin [116] also investigated how 5G technology may be used for agricultural\n\
    planting, livestock farming, and traditional farming growth [117–121].\n9. Conclusions\n\
    Modernization of agricultural methods is required to increase productivity levels\n\
    while conserving nature. Precision agriculture could improve farming works by\
    \ controlling\nactuators more efﬁciently, enhancing the use of resources, increasing\
    \ revenues, and mini-\nmizing expenses. In order to accomplish this objective,\
    \ IoT technologies have to incorporate\nmore computing performance, such as edge\
    \ computing, big data handling, automated\nresources, and safety features. As\
    \ limited devices sense a huge amount of data and forward\nit to the gateway or\
    \ the cloud, security requires special attention. The data must be secured\nthroughout\
    \ the agricultural system, from diagnosis to risks and inventory.\nEven though\
    \ numerous security issues may affect farming production, they still\ninclude\
    \ a few security measures. This could be because these technologies were in their\n\
    initial phases of development. For most of the points, only computing resources\
    \ are\nincorporated, and that has limited computation power. As a result, security\
    \ mechanisms\nare very rare in the current list of requirement speciﬁcations.\
    \ Reaching a higher level\nof agricultural development, on the other hand, necessitates\
    \ technologies with security\nfeatures that provide enough quality and validity\
    \ to incorporate these technologies on a\nhigh level. As precision agriculture\
    \ introduces new complexities, it also opens up new\nfuture directions in security\
    \ and other areas.\nIn this study, we suggested a security framework for the agricultural\
    \ internet of things\nthat integrates blockchain technology, fog computing, and\
    \ software-deﬁned networking.\nThe suggested architecture avoids the requirement\
    \ for simulation-based work with both\nprivate and public blockchain for communication\
    \ between SDN controllers and IoT devices.\nHere, for IoT connectivity, each SDN\
    \ controller is linked to a blockchain. SDN controllers\nare interconnected by\
    \ a network’s topology. One of the key objectives of the proposed\narchitecture\
    \ is to enhance communication security for IoT devices. For IoT devices with\n\
    limited resources, distributed trust-based veriﬁcation makes blockchain even more\
    \ use-\nful. With a focus on ﬁxing security and data reliability issues in a distributed\
    \ controller\ncontext. Additionally, we want to increase the accuracy of our system\
    \ using machine\nlearning methods.\nIt might be signiﬁcant to add an intrusion\
    \ detection system utilizing various deep\nlearning algorithms in future work\
    \ to prevent the insertion of fake Sensor data in the\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P., S.D. and S.R.; methodology,\

    INTRODUCTION \nThis framework introduced an IoT based sensor calibration \ntechnique\
    \ with the Runway Scheduling algorithm. Agriculture \nis the leading and emerging\
    \ subject everywhere, and \nautomation is compulsory. The population is increasing\
    \ at a \nfast rate, so food gradients are necessary for people. The \nconventional\
    \ agriculture method serves intensified results \nbecause Health monitoring of\
    \ crops and disease detection is a \ncritical task. Because of this reason, increasing\
    \ the in-depth \nresearch regarding plants for the rising of the production rate\
    \ \nis the need of the hour, which can be changed with the help of \ntraditional\
    \ methods like IoT, Machine Learning, and Artificial \nIntelligence. Until we\
    \ cover edge computing, manual machine \ncorrelation, and static threshold methods\
    \ [1][2], etc. these \nmethods give satisfactory results, but improvement is a\
    \ need \nfor disease identification. Crop maintenance and disease \ndetection\
    \ for a plant is a crucial task in agriculture; it is \ncomplex to recognize the\
    \ plant disorders manually. Therefore \nit requires tremendous work and maintenance,\
    \ along with \nmore processing time, export suggestions. Hence IoT based \nagriculture\
    \ disease monitoring is used for the recognition of \nplant diseases for image\
    \ processing and future extraction, \nclassification. This work discusses various\
    \ methods of \nidentifying plant diseases selecting their leaves as images and\
    \ \napplies 3-algorithms. This work also discussed some \nclustering and classification\
    \ algorithms used in the plant \ndisease monitoring system.  AgriTech, for instance,\
    \ relates to \nthe overall use of innovation in agriculture, another side, smart\
    \ \nagriculture is frequently used to indicate the use of IoT \nalternatives in\
    \ agriculture. The identical refers to the definition \nof intelligent farming.\
    \ IoT technologies also can transform \nseveral agricultural aspects. In other\
    \ phrases, there are more \nthan five methods in which IoT can improve agriculture:\
    \ data, \ntons of details collected by smart farming sensors, e.g., \nweather\
    \ conditions, soil quality, the advancement of crop \ngrowth, or cattle health.\
    \ This information could be used to \nmonitor your crop's specific status as well\
    \ as personnel \nappearance, machinery effectiveness, etc.  India is a cultivated\
    \ \ncountry of the United States, and about 70% of the population \ndepends on\
    \ agriculture [25]. Farmers have a significant kind \nof variety for choosing\
    \ various suitable plants and finding \nfirst-class pesticides for the plant.\
    \ Disease on plant results in a \nsizeable reduction in the tremendous amount\
    \ of agricultural \nmerchandise. The research of plant disorder complements with\
    \ \nthe studies of visually observable styles on the flowers. \nMonitoring of\
    \ fitness and sickness on plant plays an essential \ncharacteristic in cultivation\
    \ of plant life inside the farm. In the \nearly days, the monitoring and evaluation\
    \ of plant illnesses \nhave been performed manually utilizing the know-how person\
    \ \nin that subject. This calls for first-rate quantity of work and \ncalls for\
    \ excessive processing time. The image processing \ntechniques may be used inside\
    \ the plant sickness detection. In \nmost of the instances, ailment signs are\
    \ visible at the leaves, \nstem, and fruit. The plant leaf for the detection of\
    \ ailment is \nconsidered, which indicates the sickness signs. This paper \noffers\
    \ the advent of the image processing method used for \nplant disorder detection.\
    \ \nFig. 1 explains about generalized IoT architecture \nframework. In this investigation,\
    \ this work is to be taken as an \nexample.  Various sensor modules collect the\
    \ information and \nsend it back to respective modules. So sensor measurements\
    \ \nand estimations are compulsory. This estimation of the \nprocess is to perform\
    \ with the SCFM mechanism. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ of greater laborers or \nfinding more green tools to do the system [27]. Modern\
    \ \nagriculture is no tremendous. In the face of labor shortages, \nfarmers are\
    \ turning to technology to make farms extra \ninexperienced and automate the crop\
    \ manufacturing cycle. \nThe growing interest in technology and automation is\
    \ evident \nin venture capital investments for ag-tech startups. In 2007, in \n\
    step with TechCrunch, investors contributed US$200 million \nto entire of 31 ag-tech\
    \ startups. Ten years later, in 2017, total \ninvestment rose to over US$1. Five\
    \ billion dollors are split \namongst 160 startups. These startups are addressing\
    \ each \nelement of the agriculture rate chain. \nOthers create a software program\
    \ to govern the seed, soil, \nfertilizer, and irrigation, and make predictions\
    \ approximately \non timing and yield. Some startups use drones to show \nconditions\
    \ remotely and even comply with fertilizers, \ninsecticides, and other treatments\
    \ from above. A developing \ncohort of businesses is operating on agricultural\
    \ robotics to \nconstruct self-sufficient tractors, combines, and even fruit and\
    \ \nvegetable deciding on robots. Before you may automate farm \noperations, \n\
    however, \nyou \nneed \naccurate \ninformation \napproximately on the state of\
    \ the farm. We also need a way \nfor self-maintaining gadgets to connect; this\
    \ is the realm of the \nInternet of Things (IoT). IoT devices are the sensors,\

    \ cultivation, \nautomatic cropping system has been discussed. Because of \nthis,\
    \ the accuracy of the cropping has been increased for \nvarious climatic conditions\
    \ such as temperature, rain, and \ncold, respectively. According to this, water\
    \ supply and \nfertilizers have to be supplied to crops. This automation \ncontinuously\
    \ monitors the LCD screens. When various \ndiseases occur, then immediately finding\

    \ framework for \ncomputerized control and all the more explicitly to a structure\
    \ \nfor checking and overseeing crop development. Farming has \nbeen a significant\
    \ part of human presence for a long time. \nUpgrades in thinking about yields,\
    \ quickening crop \ndevelopment, guaranteeing the nature of harvests, and \naccommodating\
    \ a copious and productive collect have kept on \nadding to the pleasure and improvement\
    \ of our populace's \nsatisfaction. Significant zones for the robotization of\
    \ farming \nincorporate water system, security against climate, creepy \ncrawlies,\
    \ \nand \ninfection, \nand \naccommodating \nplant \nnourishment. Likewise, it\
    \ is critical to have the option to \nconjecture crop development and collect\
    \ with the goal that the \nfinancial aspects of reaping and appropriation can\
    \ be \nincreasingly productive. One case of a sort of yield that has \nprofited\
    \ incredibly from slow drifts in computerized \nagribusiness is the grape, which\
    \ proves to be fruitfully used to \nmake wine. The present vineyards incorporate\
    \ distinctive \nadministering frameworks for giving water to yields to a water\
    \ \nsystem. Instances of such structures are \"trickle\" or \"sprinkler\" \nframeworks\
    \ where water is steered among lines of vines by a \ncylinder having emanating\
    \ gaps dispersed at ordinary interims. \nThe water stream can be turned on or\
    \ off physically or can be \nmechanized with clock control, P.C., and so on. The\
    \ cylinders \ncan be raised over the ground, or at or subterranean level. \nThe\
    \ situation of diminishing water tables, evaporating of \nstreams, and tanks,\
    \ the capricious condition introduces an \nearnest requirement for the legitimate\
    \ use of water. To adapt \nup to this utilization of temperature and dampness\
    \ sensors at \nappropriate areas for checking of yields is actualized in [8].\
    \ A \nscheming formed through edge estimations of temperature \nalso soil dampness\

    \ gives a web \ninterface to the client. In [7] a keen dribble water organization\
    \ \nframework is planned. In this, a versatile Android application \nis utilized\
    \ to decrease the inclusion of humans. Also, it is used \nto the regulator to\
    \ screen the yield region remotely. Water \ndepletion could be reduced through\
    \ the Drip Irrigation \nframework as it works depending on data commencing water\
    \ \nlevel sensors. Selected progressively, various situated sensors \nare utilized\
    \ to screen the earth. The field climate information \ngathered and sensed together\
    \ with weather information from \ninternet repositories can be used to make several\
    \ efficient \nchoices to increase crop output. If the environmental condition\
    \ \nis warm, dry, sunny, windy, then plants require a large \nquantity of water,\
    \ and if these variables are like a cold, wet, \ncloudy, low wind, then the crop\
    \ needs less water. The \nprevious research model abstracted a scheme consisting\
    \ of six \ncomponents that are monitoring, managing, planning, \ndistributing\
    \ information, supporting the decision, and tracking \naction [22]. \nThe practical\
    \ and perfect quantity of agriculture \nmanufacturing, storing, and exporting\
    \ has been significantly \nenhanced by the IoT cloud service system by farmers.\
    \ In this \nresearch, we are presenting various architectures of IoT multi-\n\
    layer platforms for the agriculture sector by using IoT \ntechnologies [25-26].\
    \ This research contributes to significant \nsuggestions for agriculture with\
    \ developing countries [23]. \nA sensible model for automatic farming is suggested\
    \ by \ninvestigating the layer IoT model. Before that, let us identify \nthe general\
    \ construction of IoT. Establishing numerous \nphysical gadgets by and by IoT\
    \ permanently consumes a 3-\nlayer structure. The primary layer is the incorporated\
    \ request \nlayers, which in horticulture associated requests work because \n\
    it is deliberating as a U.I. Layer. It is an agriculture client, and \nit includes\
    \ rancher's mobile applications, and individual \ngadgets happen to screen the\
    \ farming region. As per this layer, \nthe farmers can take a choice to secure\
    \ their harvest as more \nand improve sustenance creation yield. The subsequent\
    \ layer \nis the data board layer, which contains a few obligations like \narrangement\
    \ and grouping of information, making, checking, \nessential leadership, and so\
    \ forth. These jobs keep up also \naccomplished in this layer. The 3rd layer is\
    \ a system \nexecutive's layer which speaks to the correspondence \ninnovations\
    \ like Gateway, RFID, GSM, Wifi, 3G, UMTS, as \nwell as Bluetooth Low Energy.\
    \ \n \nFig. 2. Conventional Layer Model. \nZigbee and so forth. The fourth layer\
    \ is a data \naccumulation layer that comprises a wide range of sensors, \ncameras,\
    \ and so on. They are utilized to gather the data of \nharvest for enhanced in\
    \ addition to simple field checking of \nhorticulture zone. Fig. 2 demonstrates\
    \ the four-layer IoT \nstructure. But maintenance is more complex, and the energy\
    \ \nconsumption of IoT networks also increases, so move to \npropose a FUZZY-C\

    \ This GUI has been \nimplemented by MATLAB 2015b software. Coming to the \nfirst\
    \ stage, i.e. offline processing unit system, it is used for \ncamera processing\
    \ parameter estimation. In this, a relative \ncamera position, angle, and tilting\
    \ has adjusted for IoT \ninstructions [10]. For example, if the location of the\
    \ camera \norientation varies concerning geometry, the following \nguidelines\
    \ are generated in the below manner. \nIf camera 1 tilting > camera 2 tilt \n\
    Vary the camera 2 position \nElse \nVary camera 1 position \nComing to the second\

    \ arrivals and departures is a complicated \nissue that needs to tackle various\
    \ and often competing factors \nof effectiveness, safety, and equity between any\

    \ demands that an operating position \nof the device in the optimized sequence\

    \ a crop monitoring system with IoT \nplatform has been designed, various methods\
    \ have been \nimplemented, but accuracy, disease finding with respect to \nfertilizers\
    \ has not been designed. Therefore, a real and \naccurate IoT based agriculture\
    \ monitoring system is necessary. \nIn this work IoT crop monitoring system has\
    \ been \nimplemented for disease finding and classification model. \nMoreover,\
    \ RWSA-FUZZYC and L.R. - IoT crop monitoring \nsystem achieved high accuracy and\
    \ throughput, and this \nagriculture monitoring system gives better results for\
    \ farmers. \nThe threshold value 15 RWSA-SCFM method obtained \nPSNR=44.18dB,\
    \ SSIM = 0.9943, BPP =1.46 and CR = 5.25. \nThese results are more accurate compared\
    \ to existed methods. \nSo, the implemented method is better than conventional\
    \ \ntechniques. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Things: A Survey on Enabling Technologies,\

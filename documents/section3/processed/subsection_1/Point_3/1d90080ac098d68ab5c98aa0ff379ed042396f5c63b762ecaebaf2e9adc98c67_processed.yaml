    the most significant anthropogenic alternation to the natural hydrological cycle,
    accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater withdrawal (Siebert et al.,
    2010, Foley et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2022). Population growth and economic
    development require increasing food production in the future, and expanding sustainable
    irrigation is essential to satisfy this burgeoning demand (Schmitt et al., 2022,
    Karimzadeh et al., 2024). Reference evapotranspiration (ETO) is a decisive factor
    for water resources management in weekly and monthly resolutions and for irrigation
    scheduling in daily intervals. A common approach for irrigation management is
    to adjust the daily ETO with crop- and growth stage-specific coefficients to determine
    the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETC) (Ji et al., 2017, Fernández, 2023).
    Under the hypothesis that the crop is fully irrigated and without any growth-limiting
    factors (biotic and abiotic factors), the volume of water lost by the crop should
    be topped up with irrigation water (Haghverdi et al., 2021). Anything more than
    this \"correct amount\" (non-consumptive water use) is considered unproductive
    as it will be lost by evaporation, runoff, or deep percolation, while anything
    less than this amount will develop water stress and potentially yield loss. Therefore,
    a realistic estimate of daily ETO is essential for sustainable water management
    and food production. The FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold standard
    of ETO calculation (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965, Allen et al., 1998). Compared
    to other empirical or semi-empirical equations, P-M is a physical-based equation
    that combines energy balance and mass transfer method and considers aerodynamic
    and surface resistance factors to calculate the evapotranspiration rate over a
    standardized cropped surface (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, P-M requires a complete
    weather station (several sensors for measuring multiple parameters) to be installed
    over an extended reference grass surface to achieve reliable results. This surface
    should be homogeneously extended towards different directions (enough fetch) to
    satisfy the heat and vapor advection assumptions. Moreover, the grass should be
    well-watered to avoid any water stress. Meeting these conditions is troubling,
    especially where labor for maintenance is scarce or expensive, and land and water
    resources are limited, which is very common in agriculturally productive regions.
    Utilizing fertile land and scarce water and labor resources for weather stations
    is not appealing to growers and stakeholders. The other problem is the number
    of stations required for irrigation management. Due to the diversity of micro-climates
    in croplands, only a dense network of stations is practically helpful for irrigation
    management. To address the abovementioned challenges, this research aims to develop
    an ETO estimation approach that relaxes the need for a reference surface. ETO
    has four meteorological driving factors: solar radiation, air temperature, air
    humidity, and wind speed (Ahmadi et al., 2022). From these factors, solar radiation
    (Rs) is the only one that does not rely on surface characteristics, as it is a
    function of incoming solar energy only. Therefore, our approach called \"SolarET\"
    uses RS, which is measured with only one sensor (i.e., pyranometer) placed on
    any arbitrary surface as the sole input parameter. There are numerous input-limited
    alternatives for ETO estimation in the literature, ranging from empirical models
    (e.g., Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to machine learning (ML) applications (e.g.,
    Chen et al., 2020). Almost all well-known empirical models were developed decades
    ago over restricted training data samples, sampling locations, and computational
    resources (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). These methods
    tend to aggregate all un-measured inputs and uncertainties deterministically into
    one empirical coefficient, which might result in inaccurate results. Also, none
    of these methods rely only on solar radiation data. On the contrary, these methods
    need information on air temperature and humidity. Since this information is a
    function of the surface, the empirical equations cannot relax the need for the
    reference grass surface. Similarly, ML alternatives available in the literature
    take air temperature and humidity as their inputs and are not primarily focused
    on bypassing the reference surface (Chen et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2022, Kushwaha
    et al., 2022). Our proposed approach uses decision tree- and neural network-based
    ML regression models to estimate daily ETO with hourly and daily RS data. The
    ML models employed in this study have shown superior performance for similar regression
    problems based on the available literature and ML competitions (Rodriguez-Galiano
    et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2020, Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020, Zhangzhong et
    al., 2023). Contrary to the available ML methods for daily ETO forecasting, which
    use only daily meteorological inputs, this research leverages hourly RS inputs
    to take advantage of the information gained from this finer temporal resolution
    data. Another essential difference between SolarET and available ML-based alternatives
    for ETO estimation lies in its generalizability. Our test set consists of unseen
    weather stations to ensure SolarET''s generalizability and applicability to new
    arbitrary locations in California. In other words, we train our models on data
    collected from some stations/locations and then test them using a previously unseen
    dataset from new stations. We use California as the case study to evaluate the
    applicability of SolarET. California is one of the most hydrologically altered
    regions in the world (Zimmerman et al., 2018). California is also one of the most
    agriculturally productive regions on the planet, with heavy reliance on irrigation
    (Lobell and Bonfils, 2008, Tindula et al., 2013). Another reason California is
    a suitable case study for this research is the reliable, long-term data available
    from several weather stations in California (Ahmadi et al., 2023). To examine
    the performance of SolarET, we test it against Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestley-Taylor
    (PT), and Romanenko empirical models. HS and PT models are developed using California
    data and are widely used and highly trusted for ETO estimation (Tabari et al.,
    2013). Leveraging high temporal resolution data, cutting-edge regression algorithms,
    and big training data availability, we hypothesize that SolarET can outperform
    empirical alternatives without requiring surface-dependent inputs. In other words,
    we hypothesize that SolarET can surpass comparable methods in terms of prediction
    accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability. 2. Study area and dataset
    California was chosen as the case study of this research. It is one of the world''s
    most prominent agriculturally productive regions, heavily dependent on irrigation.
    According to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), in an average
    year, approximately 9.6 million acres are irrigated with roughly 42 billion cubic
    meters of water. To assist irrigators in managing this immense water demand, DWR
    and the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) developed a program called
    the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) in 1982. CIMIS
    consists of over 145 automated weather stations that measure meteorological inputs
    of the Penman-Monteith equation in a standardized condition. Daily and hourly
    reports of ETO and its meteorological driving factors are publicly available on
    the CIMIS website (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). More information about the CIMIS
    program can be found on the CIMIS website. For this study, daily and hourly data
    on required variables from 131 active CIMIS stations are acquired. While some
    of those stations are located in research facilities, most are installed on private
    lands (often growers) where proper maintenance (mainly grass and fetch requirements)
    is a limiting factor. For this work, stations are chosen according to their condition
    and maintenance records, and problematic stations (e.g., stations with poor maintenance,
    inadequate or infrequent irrigation, and non-grass reference surface) are eliminated
    to ensure the quality of the input data. The train set consists of 114 stations.
    The train set data is acquired from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2022 (i.e.,
    28 years of data). Although all the stations in the train set have data until
    the end of 2022 (i.e., they are active stations), their installation date varies,
    and some of them have been installed after 1995 and, therefore, have less than
    28 years of data. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous climatic zones
    with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics. To test the
    applicability of the proposed methodology in estimating ETO at climatically diverse
    and unseen arbitrary locations, 17 stations, each representing a climatic zone,
    were chosen as the test set. Zone 11 is eliminated, as it does not have any reliable
    station. Names and characteristics of these climatic zones can be found in Table
    A1 in the appendix. Readers are referred to Ahmadi et al. (2022) for more information
    about these zones. To evaluate the generalizability of the proposed ML models,
    they have never been exposed to the test set, even for validation purposes. All
    the results reported in this paper represent the models'' performance on this
    unseen test set. To eliminate biases due to data length and climatic variability
    in longer time spans (e.g., wet or dry periods), the test set consists of data
    from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022 (five years) for all stations. In total,
    19,088,736 hourly data records have been used in this study, with 18,447,984 records
    used as the training set and the remaining 640,752 records employed as the test
    set. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of training and testing stations across California.

    3.1. Reference evapotranspiration The Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold
    standard for calculating ETO (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965). CIMIS calculates
    ETO using the P-M equation version described in the American Society of Civil
    Engineering-Environmental Water Resources Institute paper (Allen et al., 2005).
    CIMIS does not use the daily meteorological variables and daily P-M equation to
    calculate daily ETO. It reports the summation of 24 hourly ETO values from midnight
    to midnight as the daily ETO. Ahmadi et al. (2022) showed that the summation of
    hourly ETO values results in similar outputs as using the daily P-M equation.
    CIMIS uses Eq. 1 to calculate hourly ETO (Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2005,
    Walter et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2015). (1) Where Cd (the ratio of bulk surface
    to aerodynamic resistance) is equal to 0.24 and 0.96 during daytime and nighttime,
    respectively. : standardized reference evapotranspiration (mm h−1), which approximates
    grass ET : the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1) at mean air
    temperature (T) : net radiation (MJ m−2 h−1) estimated from solar radiation and
    other input variables : soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 h−1): G=0.1·Rn daytime
    and G=0.5·Rn nighttime : psychrometric constant (kPa°C−1) : mean hourly air temperature
    (°C) : mean hourly wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1) : saturation vapor pressure
    (kPa) at Ta : mean actual vapor pressure (kPa) from dew point temperature (°C),
    or relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) : latent heat of vaporization (2.45
    MJ kg−1 for water temperature of 20 °C) This equation''s first and second fractions
    are the radiation and aerodynamic terms of the P-M equation. This research uses
    the daily ETO value reported by CIMIS (i.e., the summation of hourly values) as
    the target value or predictand of ML models. 3.2. Data preprocessing and feature
    selection To relax the need of reference surface to estimate ETO, this research
    uses only solar radiation data measured by a pyranometer as the input of ML models.
    This study uses hourly RS as input to leverage more detailed measurements and
    capture the variations in solar radiation during the day. Therefore, each sample
    consists of an input vector of size 24 and a target value, which is the daily
    ETO. To ensure the reliability of input data, all samples with zero RS values
    for daytime (i.e., from 8 AM to 5 PM) have been removed from the dataset. Therefore,
    of the 795,364 daily samples used in this study, 1224 samples were eliminated.
    As only 69 of these eliminated samples are from the test set, we hypothesized
    that this process would not bias the distribution of samples in the test set and
    the study results. To ensure the robustness of ML models and improve their accuracy,
    three data preprocessing steps were taken: 1) eliminating records with null values:
    Null values are removed from the dataset to ensure accuracy, eliminate inconsistencies,
    and transform the data into a suitable format for inputting into the models. This
    filtering removed 6752 records from the training set of ML models and 4830 records
    from the test set. 2) Eliminating records with ETO values higher than 15 mm/day:
    we hypothesize these values are due to sensor errors or poor maintenance conditions.
    This filtering resulted in the elimination of 10 records from the training set.
    3) Using robust scaler: While traditional scaling techniques such as min-max scaling
    or standard scaling rely on the mean and standard deviation of the data, robust
    scaling uses different statistics that are less sensitive to outliers. Specifically,
    it leverages the median and interquartile range (IQR) to scale the input data.
    By reducing the potential impact of extreme values on the performance of ML models,
    robust scaling helps to mitigate the influence of outliers in the input variables.
    Eq. 2 shows how scaled data records are calculated using the robust scaling method:
    (2) Where, as the names suggest, is the value before scaling, and is the median
    of the data distribution; is the value after scaling. and are the 75th quantile
    and 25th quantile of the data distribution, respectively. Two strategies are employed
    for selecting the inputs of ML models. In the first strategy, all zero RS values
    (i.e., nighttime) have been substituted with the daily mean RS value. In this
    strategy, which is called \"mean substitution,\" each input record for the ML
    models has 24 features. To implicitly capture the daylight period, the mean daily
    RS is calculated as the sum of all hourly RS values divided by the number of non-zero
    RS values. This procedure differs from calculating daily RS, where 24 is the denominator.
    As the second strategy, we used feature selection methods to assign quantitative
    feature importance measures to each hour (i.e., each feature). In this strategy,
    only the most essential features are used as the input to train the models. To
    analyze the model performance under different feature selection strategies, we
    used correlation-based (Pearson and Spearman), information-based (Mutual Information),
    and intrinsic (CatBoost) feature selection strategies. To compare the use of hourly
    RS values against coarser temporal resolution inputs, we also tested using daily
    RS as input. In the case of daily Rs, we used a sine function of Julian date as
    the second feature to capture the seasonality. Using a sine function of the Julian
    date has merits over using the raw Julian date, as it can simulate the cyclic
    nature of input records (Eq. 3). (3) Where is the Julian date and is the cyclic
    Julian date value used as the second feature along with daily RS for the daily
    ML models. 3.2.1. Pearson correlation The Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson''s
    \"r\" measures the linear correlation between two data sets or two random variables.
    It is a normalized measure of covariance, and therefore, its value is always between
    −1 and 1, while 1 shows the perfect positive linear correlation and −1 indicates
    the perfect negative linear correlation. When there is no linear correlation between
    the two variables r equals zero. The Pearson correlation of two random variables
    X and Y ( is defined as: (4) Where is the covariance of two variables, and and
    are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively. We used the Pandas library
    in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation. 3.2.2. Spearman correlation Spearman''s
    rank correlation (rs) coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank
    statistic that measures the strength of correlation between the ranking of two
    variables (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011). Although the Spearman correlation between
    two variables X and Y is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values
    of those two variables, i.e., R(X) and R(Y), the Spearman correlation is not a
    measure of the linear relationship. Spearman''s coefficient assesses how well
    an arbitrary monotonic function (linear or not) can describe the relationship
    between two variables. Eq. 5 shows how rs is calculated. Like the Pearson correlation,
    rs values are between −1 and 1. We used the Pandas library in Python to calculate
    the Spearman correlation. (5) 3.2.3. Mutual information Mutual information (MI)
    measures how much information about a random variable we can acquire by knowing
    another random variable. MI is a non-negative dimensionless quantity with units
    of information (bits) that quantifies the dependency between two variables. MI
    measures the amount of information gain or uncertainty reduction about one variable
    given knowledge of another. MI is a non-negative measure between 0 and 1. It is
    equal to zero if and only if two random variables are strictly independent, and
    higher values mean higher dependency (Kraskov et al., 2004). In contrast to the
    Pearson correlation coefficient or other linear correlation measures, MI is also
    sensitive to dependencies that do not demonstrate themselves in covariance; therefore,
    it is more generalizable and reliable for feature importance evaluation, especially
    in non-linear contexts like evapotranspiration equations. Detailed information
    about MI can be found in the references (Kozachenko et al., 1987; Kraskov et al.,
    2004; Ross, 2014). We used the Scikit-learn software library in Python to calculate
    MI. 3.2.4. CatBoost feature importance The CatBoost regression model performs
    automatic feature importance analysis on the input data during training. After
    training the model, the relative importance of each input feature can be acquired.
    This measure shows how much, on average, the model prediction changes if the feature
    value changes. Higher feature importance values indicate more significant changes
    to the prediction if the feature value changes. CatBoost feature importance is
    a non-negative value. Feature importance values are normalized so that the sum
    of the importance values of all features is equal to 100. This normalization enables
    a relative assessment of the importance values across various features. For feature
    importance analysis, we chose the hyperparameters of the CatBoost model according
    to outperforming CatBoost models trained on similar datasets on Kaggle, with no
    further hyperparameter tuning. 70% of the data was used to train the model, and
    30% as the test set for model evaluation. More information about the CatBoost
    model is provided in the following sections. We used the catboost library in Python
    to calculate the CatBoost feature importance. 3.3. Machine learning Five ML algorithms
    were chosen to test if only RS data can predict ETO over California. We selected
    highly used and well-known regression algorithms. These algorithms have demonstrated
    superior performance in literature and ML competitions with datasets similar to
    the one used in our study (Zhang et al., 2020). We also used an automatic hyperparameter
    tuning framework to optimize the hyperparameters of the CatBoost algorithm. We
    used this automatic hyperparameter optimization only for CatBoost since CatBoost
    was the best model in our pilot model training, utilizing only a portion of input
    data. Also, according to the literature and ML competition results, CatBoost has
    demonstrated superiority in similar regression problems. Specifically, Zhang et
    al. (2020) showed that the CatBoost model is the most accurate compared to similar
    ML models for daily ETO estimation. 3.3.1. CatBoost CatBoost is an open-source
    gradient-boosted decision tree with widespread applications for classification
    and regression tasks to many data types (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018, Dorogush
    et al., 2018). CatBoost aims to mitigate the challenges of overfitting and target
    leakage through its innovative techniques (Asghari et al., 2023). The algorithm
    introduces two main innovations compared to other gradient-boosted decision trees:
    ordered target statistics and ordered boosting (Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020).
    The term \"ordered target statistics\" refers to the technique CatBoost uses to
    encode categorical variables. \"Ordered boosting\" is a refinement of gradient
    boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). Through this technique, a decision tree
    model is recursively trained on the prediction residuals of data points. This
    approach allows the model to obtain unshifted residuals by applying the current
    model to new training examples at each step, leading to reduced overfitting. The
    main difference between CatBoost and other gradient boosting algorithms like LightGBM
    and XGBoost is that CatBoost uses symmetric or balanced trees. In other words,
    in CatBoost, the splitting condition is consistent across all nodes at the same
    tree depth. Symmetric trees are faster to train and less prone to overfitting.
    Nevertheless, symmetric trees are weaker learners than asymmetric trees, and therefore,
    they generally make worse predictions. However, as the main idea of gradient boosting
    is to combine numerous weak learners to make predictions, the CatBoost algorithm
    tends to make more accurate predictions than LightGBM and XGBoost in several cases.
    Detailed information about the CatBoost algorithm can be found in Prokhorenkova
    et al. (2018). We used the CatBoost package in Python to develop the CatBoost
    model. We employed Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework for automatic
    hyperparameter tuning of the CatBoost model (Akiba et al., 2019). Optuna allows
    users to dynamically construct the hyperparameter search space by offering a define-by-run
    API. Optuna has a user-friendly setup, and it provides efficient sampling and
    pruning algorithms for customization. Detailed information about Optuna and its
    algorithm can be found in Akiba et al. (2019). We did not use the test set in
    automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure our ML models'' generalizability and
    avoid data leakage in our study. Instead, we utilized a cross-validation set consisting
    of 16 stations from the training data, where each represents a distinct climatic
    zone. This cross-validation set mimics the unseen test set. With Optuna, we conducted
    100 trials to optimize the CatBoost model hyperparameters. 3.3.2. Deep neural
    network The feed-forward neural network is the ancestor of all deep learning architectures.
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known and well-studied architectures with
    innumerable applications as predictive regression models and are commonplace in
    ET prediction and forecasting (Kumar et al., 2002, Kim and Kim, 2008). Although
    gradient-boosted algorithms, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, are generally
    considered more suitable for tabular datasets (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022), such
    as the dataset used in our study, we also included a deep neural network (DNN)
    algorithm in our models to assess its performance relative to other methods. We
    used the TensorFlow library in Python to build our DNN model. Our model has three
    hidden layers with 16, 32, and 16 units, respectively. The activation function
    of input and hidden layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Mean Squared Error
    (MSE) is the loss function of the network. Ridge Regression (L2) and Lasso Regression
    (L1) are used as kernel and activity regularizers, respectively, with a regularization
    parameter of 0.01. The model uses Adam optimizer and is trained over 30 epochs
    with a batch size of 64. 3.3.3. LightGBM LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine),
    originally proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed by Microsoft as a free and
    open-source framework, efficiently implements the gradient boosting algorithm
    and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting is an ensemble method where ensembles
    are constructed from decision trees. Models are fit through a gradient descent
    optimization algorithm, where the loss gradient is minimized as the model is tuned
    (Brownlee, 2020). We used the LightGBM package in Python to develop the LightGBM
    model. We used a maximum of 30 tree leaves and a maximum of 7 tree depths for
    base learners. We used 2000 boosted trees to fit. More information about the LightGBM
    method can be found in Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.3.4. Random forest
    Random forest (RF) is a supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification
    and regression problems. RF is a bagging technique that trains many decision trees
    in parallel, and its results are based on an ensemble of the trained trees. When
    used as a regression model, RF returns the mean or average prediction of the individual
    trees as the model''s output. Detailed information about the RF algorithm can
    be found in the references (Ho, 1995, Breiman, 2001). We used the Scikit-learn
    software library in Python to build the RF model. We used 1000 trees in the forest,
    with a maximum depth of 9. 3.3.5. XGBoost XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
    is an open-source gradient-boosting software library. XGBoost provides a parallel
    tree boosting (also known as gradient-boosted decision trees) that efficiently
    solves classification and regression problems. More information about the XGBoost
    model can be found in the references (Chen et al., 2015, Chen and Guestrin, 2016).
    We used the XGBoost library in Python to build the XGBoost model. We used 1000
    trees in the ensemble, with minimum depth and maximum leaves of 7 and 9, respectively.
    The learning rate was set to 0.3. 3.4. Empirical models We evaluated the performance
    of our input-limited data-driven approach against available input-limited alternatives
    for ETO estimation. Three well-known and reliable methods were chosen for this
    aim: a radiation-based method (i.e., Priestley-Taylor), a temperature-based method
    (i.e., Hargreaves-Samani), and a mass transfer-based method (i.e., Romanenko).
    Although none of these methods eliminate the need for a standard reference surface
    and their meteorological inputs rely on the measurement conditions, the comparison
    between SolarET and the methods is beneficial as they are well-established, widely-used
    procedures for ETO estimation. 3.4.1. Priestley-Taylor As shown in Eq. 1, the
    P-M equation consists of a radiation term and an aerodynamic term, where the latter
    groups the elements that represent the surface-atmosphere interactions (Pereira,
    2004). By analyzing data collected over various surfaces, Priestley and Taylor
    (1972) proposed an empirical adjustment to the P-M equation (Mallick et al., 2014).
    The Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation neglects the aerodynamic term and corrects
    the estimated ET by a dimensionless coefficient α (the Priestley-Taylor parameter).
    This coefficient accounts for the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and air and
    surface resistances to estimate the ET from a short, well-watered grass surface.
    Experimental results from several sites worldwide resulted in an average value
    of α=1.26. We use this value in this research. Pereira (2004) states that 1.26
    is a good estimate for α in Davis, California. Eq. 6 depicts how the PT method
    calculates ETO: (6) Where is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve
    ( ℃ ), is the psychrometric constant ( ℃ ), is the latent heat of vaporization
    (2.45 ), is the net radiation ( ), and is the soil heat flux ( ). The Δ over Δ+γ
    represents the fraction of diabatic energy (Rn - G) contributing to ET from the
    grass surface, and the adiabatic contribution to ET is approximately 26% of the
    diabatic contribution. The daily ground heat flux is assumed to be G=0. 3.4.2.
    Hargreaves-Samani Hargreaves-Samani (HS) is an input-limited empirical equation
    to estimate ETO using air temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985). This equation is based on the Hargreaves original equation,
    approximating solar radiation with extraterrestrial radiation and maximum minus
    minimum air temperature. Since the HS equation is developed with daily lysimeter
    data from Davis, California, it is well-suited for and highly used in California,
    which makes it a good benchmark for validating our approach. The HS equation is
    as follows: (7) Where is reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), is the extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm/day, for equivalent evaporated water depth), , , and are the mean,
    maximum, and minimum daily air temperature (ºC), respectively. Since data from
    Davis, California, is used to calibrate the constant value of 0.0023, we use the
    same value in this research. 3.4.3. Romanenko Romanenko equation is a mass transfer-based
    empirical equation that uses air temperature and relative humidity to estimate
    ETO. The mass transfer-based methods are essentially based on Dalton''s gas law
    and employ the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface
    to the atmosphere (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). Romanenko equation estimates daily
    ETO as follows: (8) Where RH is the relative humidity (%). 3.5. Performance measures
    In this study, two deterministic performance measures are employed to investigate
    the accuracy of ETO estimation models: root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
    absolute error (MAE) (Moriasi et al., 2015): (9) (10) Where N is the number of
    samples, and and are observed and predicted ETO values at ith sample, respectively.
    Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate higher accuracies and better performance. Although
    both RMSE and MAE indicate average model prediction error in units of the variable
    of interest, they have fundamental differences. Since RMSE squares the errors
    before averaging them, it gives higher weights to large errors. Consequently,
    RMSE tends to penalize large errors more severely than MAE. According to Chai
    and Draxler (2014), each of these metrics has its own merits in explaining the
    model performance; therefore, in this research, we use them in tandem. 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Data investigation Fig. 2 shows the number of data samples
    and the training data distribution for each climatic zone. This figure shows that
    zones 14, 6, and 12 have the highest number of stations and input data samples
    in the training set. On the other hand, there is no data from zone 4 in the training
    set, as all the samples from this zone have been eliminated in the data preprocessing.
    However, zone 4 is present in the test set. This can further evaluate the generalizability
    of the presented methodology for ETO estimation in unseen locations in California.
    Zones 12 and 14 cover a vast area of the Central Valley. The Central Valley is
    one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, with ideal soil
    and climate for a variety of crops but limited water resources. With limited to
    no rainfall in the summer, the Central Valley''s agriculture relies on irrigation.
    About one-sixth of the US irrigated land lies in the Central Valley (Reilly et
    al., 2008). This heavy irrigation dependence explains this region''s high density
    of CIMIS stations. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Number of samples, stations, and distribution of the training
    data for each climatic zone. Fig. 2 suggests a relatively uniform distribution
    of solar radiation across California, with lower values in coastal zones (e.g.,
    zones 1 and 2) and higher values in deserts (e.g., zones 17 and 18). The lower
    RS values on the coast can be attributed to dense fog. The ETO distribution in
    California reveals more variability across different zones. The most anomalous
    zones in terms of ETO distribution are coastal zones with very low ETO and desert
    zones with very high ETO. Also, the box plots of Fig. 2 illustrate a broader ETO
    distribution for desert zones. Being abnormal regarding RS and ETO distribution
    and having fewer input data, we hypothesize that our data-driven models struggle
    with accurate ETO prediction in coastal and desert zones. 4.2. Feature selection
    The results of the feature selection methods are presented in Fig. 3, which suggests
    no sharp difference between the features'' importance, especially from Pearson
    and Spearman correlations. As expected, all feature selection methods find the
    hourly RS values from morning and around noon to be the most important features.
    Based on these results, we decided to use the six most essential features/hours
    as the input of the ML models. For example, the six most important hourly Rs values
    selected by the CatBoost feature importance method are 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, and 12,
    respectively (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The most important features (i.e., solar radiation from
    different hours of the day) selected by each feature selection method and their
    corresponding score. It should be noted that both Pearson and MI methods result
    in hours 8–13 of Rs as the six most important features, only with various orders.
    Therefore, the results for Pearson and MI methods are the same and combined hereafter.
    Because different methods suggest a uniform feature importance, we hypothesize
    that the mean substitution procedure (i.e., using all hourly RS values) might
    be superior to using only selected features as input. 4.3. Machine learning models
    The overall performance of the ML models and feature selection methods is depicted
    in Fig. 4 and Figure A1 in the appendix. As these figures show, CatBoost and RF
    have very similar performances in terms of prediction accuracy. It should be noted
    that while Optuna has automatically optimized the CatBoost model''s hyperparameters,
    RF hyperparameters are set manually. This would suggest that automatic hyperparameter
    tuning for this type of regression problem does not guarantee higher accuracy,
    and a manual hyperparameter tuning strategy can result in equally accurate models.
    Also, most of the available automatic hyperparameter tuning frameworks, including
    Optuna, are specifically designed to optimize the hyperparameters of deep learning
    architectures, where the high dimensionality of the hyperparameter space interferes
    with manual hyperparameter tuning strategies like grid or random search and might
    result in sub-efficient models (Akiba et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res

    (RMSE) values (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods
    over the whole testing set. Fig. 4 and A1 illustrate the overall superiority of
    using all the hourly RS values with the mean substitution method over selecting
    the most important hours. Among feature selection methods, ML models using CatBoost
    intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation perform better than MI and
    Pearson correlation. The quality and relevance of the selected features can influence
    the performance of ML models. In our case, the difference in performance between
    the feature selection methods can be attributed to 1) the ability to handle non-linear
    relationships: ML models can effectively capture non-linear relationships between
    features and the target variable. In this case, CatBoost''s intrinsic feature
    importance considers the inherent non-linear relationship between the input and
    output of the model and selects features that have the highest impact on the model''s
    performance. 2) Robustness to outliers and noise: These observations can also
    be attributed to CatBoost intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation''s
    more effective robustness to outliers than Pearson correlation and Mutual Information
    correlation. Considering the rank-based correlation in Spearman''s correlation
    or the model-specific feature importance in CatBoost, these methods may have selected
    more robust features that lead to better model performance. Using feature selection
    or mean substitution, the CatBoost model with the mean substitution method stands
    out as the most accurate hourly model. Additionally, the RF excels as the preferred
    choice between daily models. We compare these models as the best-performing frameworks
    with empirical ETO estimation models. Fig. 4 and A1 clearly show that the DNN
    model falls behind all ensemble decision tree-based algorithms (i.e., RF and gradient
    boosting-based frameworks). This finding agrees with previous studies where tree-based
    algorithms outperformed vanilla neural networks in predictive regression problems
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015, Pham et al., 2020; Jun, 2021). To better understand
    how SolarET performs in different climatic zones of California, we included one
    CIMIS station with around five years of data from each zone. These stations have
    not been used to train the model; therefore, SolarET''s performance in these locations
    can be claimed as its performance in any arbitrary location in those climatic
    zones. Fig. 5 and A2 depict the models'' accuracy for each zone in the test set.
    These results clearly show that the performance of various ML models and feature
    selection methods is similar in each climatic zone. In other words, we cannot
    claim that a specific combination of the ML model and feature selection technique
    is more suitable for a geographical location or particular climatic characteristics.
    All successful prediction frameworks (i.e., ensemble decision tree-based algorithms)
    have lower accuracies in estimating ETO in coastal (zones 1 and 2) and desert
    (zones 17 and 18) areas (Fig. 5 and A2). Download : Download high-res image (444KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values
    (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods over climatic
    zones of California. From an ML perspective, three reasons might contribute to
    the lower accuracy of SolarET in the coastal and desert regions: 1) the low number
    of training data from these zones: Fig. 2 shows limited training data in these
    zones- leading to their insufficient representation of data patterns. Other zones
    also have low numbers of training samples but high predictive accuracy (e.g.,
    zones 16, 13, and 10). Although, these zones are more similar to the majority
    of the training set in terms of ETO distribution (Fig. 2). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that the first reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in the coast and
    desert data is the low number of training samples resembling the statistical characteristics
    of the data from these zones. 2) Higher level of outlier values in both training
    and test sets: As depicted in Fig. 6, there is a higher percentage of outlier
    values in stations 17 and 18 compared to other stations, which could impact the
    performance of the ML models in these specific zones. These outliers introduce
    noise and may not follow the patterns that the ML models have learned from the
    training data, leading to less accurate predictions. 3) Lack of relevant features:
    According to Fig. 7, we hypothesize that one of the other reasons for less accurate
    predictions in zones 17 and 18 is the lower correlation between the daily RS and
    ETO in these regions. Various climatic variables, such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation influence ETO. In zones 17 and 18, hourly or daily
    solar radiation may not accurately capture all the required information to estimate
    ETO. All in all, it is worth mentioning that the combination of these reasons,
    rather than a single factor, may have led to inferior performance of the ML models
    in these zones. It is also expected that advection is a more considerable contribution
    to ETO in desert regions than in the Central Valley or along the coast, and the
    lack of information on temperature, humidity, and wind speed in the ML models
    should lead to more considerable errors in regions having large fluctuations in
    aerodynamic contributions to ETO (Berengena and Gavilán, 2005). Download : Download

    causes of this lower performance are discussed in Section 4.4. 4.4. Reference
    evapotranspiration prediction To evaluate our approach of using ML models with
    only pyranometer data for ETO estimation, we compared its performance against
    three empirical limited-input ETO estimation models. It should be noted that both
    approaches, ML and empirical models, were evaluated using the same test set but
    with different features. Fig. 8 and A3 depict the findings of this comparison
    over 17 climatic zones of the test set. In these figures, we displayed the results
    of only the best-performing data-driven models. In the case of hourly inputs,
    the CatBoost ML model with mean substitution is the best, and in the case of daily
    inputs, the random forest model gives the highest accuracy (Fig. 4 and A1). Download

    Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for empirical models and SolarET over climatic
    zones of California. As seen in Fig. 8 and A3, our hourly model generally works
    as well or even better than the most accurate empirical model (i.e., Priestley-Taylor).
    This is especially important as our model takes only solar radiation data as input,
    while PT takes information from minimum and maximum air temperature and elevation
    in addition to net radiation. Also, our hourly and daily models clearly beat Hargreaves-Samani
    and Romanenko in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that SolarET
    works very well unless there are extremely high or low contributions of aerodynamics
    to the ETO (e.g., desert and coastal climates). This is not surprising, as SolarET
    can only mimic the radiation term of the P-M equation, as it takes no information
    about the aerodynamics term (Eq. 1). Still, Fig. 8 and A3 illustrate that SolarET
    works better than PT as a radiation-based ET estimation model in desert climates.
    The inferior performance of SolarET in comparison to PT in coastal regions might
    be due to the high humidity fluctuation in these regions due to variations in
    wind direction, e.g., from the land or from the ocean, which lead to significant
    variations in temperature and humidity. Moreover, the presence of intermittent
    clouds and fog in these regions might be another reason for the lower accuracy
    of our model as opposed to PT. The low accuracy of empirical models in desert
    climate might be due to two reasons: 1) these models are not calibrated for desert
    climate (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985, Tabari et al.,
    2013); and 2) these models do not adequately account for heat advection in hot
    desert climates (Tolk et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2023). We hypothesize that another
    reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in deserts and coast is not accounting
    for aridity. This pattern is the same for PT and HS in desert regions. This goes
    along with not considering the aerodynamics contribution to the daily ETO. We
    hypothesize that adding information about vapor pressure can solve this problem.
    Fig. 9 analyzes the performance of SolarET against available empirical alternatives
    over the entire test set in terms of prediction accuracy. RMSE and MAE measure
    the dissimilarity between input-limited alternatives and P-M equation prediction.
    We use these performance measures to assess which input-limited ETO estimation
    alternative can simulate the daily P-M equation more realistically. As Fig. 9
    demonstrates, our hourly and daily models beat all empirical alternatives in terms
    of similarity to the P-M daily ETO. Our hourly model is the winner of this comparison.
    Although the overall performance of the hourly model is close to the daily model
    according to Fig. 9, as Fig. 8 depicts, the hourly model results in identical
    or more accurate predictions for all climatic zones. Interestingly, the hourly
    model works much better than the daily model in coastal regions (zones 1, 2, and
    3 in Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the information gained from the higher
    temporal resolution input (i.e., hourly Rs) is beneficial in simulating climatically
    diverse samples and can boost generalizability. Download : Download high-res image

    and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values for empirical models and SolarET over the
    entire test set. Fig. 9 shows that the PT equation, which is a radiation-based
    model, is the most accurate empirical ETO estimation model. The superiority of
    SolarET and the high accuracy of the PT model signifies the suitability of radiation
    data for input-limited ETO estimation in California. This finding agrees with
    Ahmadi et al. (2022) findings on the high correlation between radiation and ETO
    over California. Fig. 9 illustrates that HS and Romanenko models are the least
    realistic representations of P-M ETO over California. However, it should be noted
    that since we aim to compare not only the accuracy but also the generalizability
    of models, the HS model was not calibrated in this study. We hypothesize that
    calibrating HS will improve its accuracy in ETO estimation. Analyzing the errors
    of the ML and empirical models can provide valuable insights into their performance
    and help identify areas for improvement. In this vein, we divided the ETO distribution
    into distinct ranges and compared the best-performing ML model, CatBoost, using
    hourly Rs, with the PT empirical model. Fig. 10 illustrates the percentage of
    values within each specific ETO range where the value of exceeds 0.5. In this
    equation, Refers to P-M value and is what the model predicts. This figure indicates
    the more accurate predictions of CatBoost compared to PT across various ranges
    of ETO values. Overall, CatBoost maintains its superiority not only in the whole
    distribution of ETO over the entire test set but also in cases of low or high
    values of ETO. Moreover, as Figure A4 in the appendix shows, the distribution
    of SolarET error is similar to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value close
    to zero. This distribution suggests the error is random, not a systematic over-
    or under-estimation of ETO. It is also worth mentioning that SolarET accuracy
    is comparable to the best-performing ML-based ETO estimation models available
    in the literature, while it does not use surface-related inputs such as air temperature
    (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download : Download

    5. Summary and conclusion This paper develops a generalizable data-driven approach
    to estimate ETO using only solar radiation data. Since solar radiation is the
    only driving force of ETO, whose measurement does not require a reference crop
    surface, the developed approach (i.e., SolarET) can cut the cost of land, irrigation,
    maintenance, and extra sensors while assisting irrigators and water managers with
    their farm-level and regional decisions. As incoming solar radiation is not a
    function of the surface, a simple pyranometer placed on any location can measure
    the inputs of SolarET. Using a test set from unseen arbitrary locations, we showed
    the generalizability of SolarET over California. Our findings reveal that SolarET
    beats the Hargraves-Samani and Romanenko models in terms of accuracy. SolarET
    works better than Priestley-Taylor, a well-known radiation-based ETO estimation
    method, without using any information about air temperature. Although SolarET
    works accurately in heavily irrigated regions of California and beats all empirical
    models in desert climates, it is less accurate in coastal regions. Future studies
    can include publicly available air temperature data as another input, along with
    measured solar radiation. Adding publicly available air temperature data can result
    in better performance in coastal and desert regions, where the contribution of
    the aerodynamics term of the Penman-Monteith equation is different from other
    inland regions of California. Moreover, developing models tailored to a specific
    region or climate might result in higher accuracies but at the cost of lower generalizability.
    The accuracy-generalizability trade-off of this data-driven approach is another
    area for future research. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mohammad Hossein

  title: 'SolarET: A generalizable machine learning approach to estimate reference
    evapotranspiration from solar radiation'
  verbatim_quote1: '"CatBoost consistently maintains its superiority not only in the
    whole distribution of ETO over the entire test set but also in cases of low or
    high values of ETO"'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Our hourly model generally works as well or even better than
    the most accurate empirical model (i.e., Priestley-Taylor). This is especially
    important as our model takes only solar radiation data as input, while PT takes
    information from minimum and maximum air temperature and elevation in addition
    to net radiation"'
  verbatim_quote3: '"Although the overall performance of the hourly model is close
    to the daily model according to Fig. 9, as Fig. 8 depicts, the hourly model results
    in identical or more accurate predictions for all climatic zones. Interestingly,
    the hourly model works much better than the daily model in coastal regions (zones
    1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the information gained from
    the higher temporal resolution input (i.e., hourly Rs) is beneficial in simulating
    climatically diverse samples and can boost generalizability."'
- analysis: 'In this study, an accurate, comprehensive yet robust model to estimate
    water deficit (using normalized stomatal conductance and effective water content)
    at the different growth stages of winter wheat, based solely on UAV data, was
    developed. To ensure that the resulting models were more robust, they were trained
    and tested on datasets acquired in different years.


    The experiment was conducted at the China Agricultural University Experimental
    Station in Zhuozhou (39.45°N, 115.85°E), Hebei Province, China. The study area
    climate is warm summer continental (Dwb under the Köppen classification) with
    a summer precipitation pattern. The annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and
    the annual mean temperature is about 11.6 ℃. The soil is mainly sandy (using the
    definition of the soil texture triangle recommended by the USDA) (Shirazi and
    Boersma, 1984). Before sowing, the soil was sampled to test physicochemical properties.
    The average field capacity (FC) and the wilting point (WP) in the 0–40 cm soil
    layer are 0.24 cm3 cm-3 and 0.05 cm3 cm-3, respectively.


    The stomatal conductance (GS) and soil water content (SWC) are important indicators
    for characterizing crop water stress. Large-scale monitoring of crop water status
    based on UAV remote sensing technology is greatly important for wheat management.


    Compared to VIs, the combination of VIs and TIs consistently improved the prediction
    accuracy of NGS and EWC at all stages. R2 values improved from 0.74 to 0.79 at
    pre-heading stage and from 0.87 to 0.90 at post-heading stage for the GBDT method.
    Among the three methods, PLS usually performed slightly worse, particularly in
    the early and later growth stages. For the individual growth stages, GBDT and
    SVM performed similarly. However, the GBDT model performed consistently best for
    the aggregate pre-heading and post-heading models.'

    irrigation scheduling in crop production. The purpose of this study was to establish
    robust water deficit models of winter wheat in different growing seasons by combining
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral and thermal images. In 2021 and 2022,
    a water deficit field experiment on winter wheat was carried out in Hebei Province,
    China. Five-band multispectral and thermal images were obtained with a UAV at
    six key growth stages of winter wheat. Fourteen vegetation indices (VIs) and two
    thermal indices (TIs) were calculated. Simultaneously, wheat stomatal conductance
    and soil water content were measured. On this basis, normalized stomatal conductance
    (NGS) and effective water content (EWC) were calculated. TIs had the highest correlation
    with NGS and EWC at early growth stages, whereas ratio vegetation index (RVI),
    modified simple ratio index (MSR) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
    were highly correlated at later stages. Partial least squares (PLS), support vector
    machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) were used to predict
    NGS and EWC for each growth stage, with the data of 2021 as the training set and
    the data of 2022 as independent test set. In general, GBDT outperformed PLS and
    SVM, and NGS was better predicted than EWC. Including VIs and TIs effectively
    improved the estimation accuracy of the predictive models. The test set results
    of the NGS and EWC models built by GBDT achieved the best performance in flowering
    stage (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE)
    = 0.08, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 14.7%) and filling stage (R2
    = 0.90, RMSE = 0.05, NRMSE = 15.9%), respectively. The models of the post-heading
    stage were better than those of the pre-heading stage for both NGS and EWC. This
    study provides a robust method for diagnosing water stress only using UAV remote
    sensing data.

    contentMachine learningRobustness 1. Introduction Wheat is the food crop with
    the largest planting area and the widest distribution in the world (Reynolds and
    Braun, 2022). Irrigation is vital for agricultural production as irrigated wheat
    yield increases by about 34 % compared with rainfed yield on a global scale (Wang
    et al., 2021). However, irrigated agriculture accounts for about 70% of the freshwater
    withdrawals in the world (FAO, 2023), putting pressure on the global water cycle.
    Precision irrigation enables quantitative decision-making and variable inputs
    of irrigation amount by considering spatial and temporal variations in crop water
    demand (Abioye et al., 2020, Daccache et al., 2015). Thus, water use can be managed
    more efficiently through precision irrigation management. This requires accurate
    information on the spatial variation of plant and soil water status and water
    requirement (Maes and Steppe, 2019), which can enable the formulation of plans
    for variable irrigation in large-scale production. Water stress reduces the transpiration
    and stomatal conductance, resulting in an increase in canopy temperature (Jackson
    et al., 1981, Kögler and Söffker, 2019, Buckley, 2019). This change can be observed
    reliably with thermal remote sensing, although corrections for weather conditions
    and vegetation characteristics are needed to interpret the signal (Maes and Steppe,
    2012, Maes et al., 2016). Measurements of canopy reflectance in the visual and
    near infrared are also commonly implemented for diagnosing crop water stress (Das
    et al., 2022, Traore et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2021), but provide information
    only in an advanced stage of water stress, when the canopy structure (e.g., leaf
    angle distribution, reductions in leaf area) or leaf characteristics (e.g., reduction
    in chlorophyll, increase in photoprotective pigments as carotenes or anthocyanins)
    are affected (Han et al., 2020). Yang et al. (2020) pointed out that normalized
    difference red-edge index (NDRE) and red-edge chlorophyll index (RECI) can detect
    the water status of wheat under water stress and can be used to monitor crop efficiency
    under varying water dosages. Bhandari et al. (2021) found that excess green index
    (ExG), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDRE were positively
    correlated with wheat yield at flowering stage and filling stage under water stress
    condition compared to that at early growth stages. Satellite remote sensing can
    be used to monitor crop water conditions on a large scale (Bhattarai et al., 2017,
    Veysi et al., 2017). However, thermal data are not yet available at high spatial
    and spectral resolution, and multispectral reflectance data can be affected by
    clouds and offers limited spatial and temporal resolutions (Ezenne et al., 2019).
    Remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides the advantages of
    wide coverage, short measurement cycles, low cost, and flexible operation (Feng
    et al., 2021, Gago et al., 2015, Maes and Steppe, 2019). Applying UAVs also permits
    simultaneous measurements with multiple sensors (Maes and Steppe, 2019). Combining
    data from different sensors taps into different sources of information (Zhang
    et al., 2015) and can be useful in water stress research, particularly when focusing
    on water stress modelling. Moran et al. (1994) calculated the water deficit index
    (WDI) that combined thermal, multispectral, and meteorological data, which provided
    accurate estimation of alfalfa field evapotranspiration rates and relative field
    water deficit. Abuzar et al. (2009) built a modified trapezoid water stress model
    by combining UAV thermal and multispectral images that can be used both in wheat
    irrigated and rainfed situations. Cheng et al. (2022) showed that a soil water
    content model of corn that combined RGB, multispectral and thermal data resulted
    in higher accuracies than the single variable model. However, analyzing data obtained
    from different sensors is challenging. Few studies have used a combination of
    multispectral and thermal data from UAV platforms to assess stomatal conductance
    and soil water content in winter wheat. Another limitation of most previous studies
    is that the training and test datasets are not independent, resulting in an overly
    optimistic appraisal of the model performance. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate
    whether UAV remote sensing can improve the applicability of water stress models
    for different wheat growing seasons and stages, with separate training and test
    datasets. The goal of this study was to develop an accurate, comprehensive yet
    robust model to estimate water deficit (using normalized stomatal conductance
    and effective water content) at the different growth stages of winter wheat, based
    solely on UAV data. To ensure that the resulting models were more robust, they
    were trained and tested on datasets acquired in different years. We investigated
    whether a combination of multispectral and thermal imagery improves the model
    robustness compared to multispectral data alone. For this purpose, we evaluated
    the performance of different machine learning methods (partial least squares (PLS),
    support vector machine (SVM) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)). 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and experimental treatments The experiment was conducted
    at the China Agricultural University Experimental Station in Zhuozhou (39.45°N,
    115.85°E), Hebei Province, China. The study area climate is warm summer continental
    (Dwb under the Köppen classification) with a summer precipitation pattern. The
    annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the annual mean temperature is about
    11.6 ℃. The soil is mainly sandy (using the definition of the soil texture triangle
    recommended by the USDA) (Shirazi and Boersma, 1984). The average field capacity
    (FC) and the wilting point (WP) in the 0–40 cm soil layer are 0.24 cm3 cm-3 and
    0.05 cm3 cm-3, respectively. Before sowing, the soil was sampled to test physicochemical
    properties. The content of soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, nitrate
    nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen were 20.2 g kg-1, 32.5 mg kg-1, 14.0 mg kg-1, and
    4.6 mg kg-1, respectively, acquired with ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer.
    The content of exchangeable potassium was 55.0 mg kg-1, obtained by atomic absorption
    spectroscopy. Table 1 shows the sowing parameters of winter wheat. In the second
    year, the wheat grains harvested in the first year were used as seeds. To ensure
    a sufficient number of initial seedlings, the sowing rate in 2022 exceeded that
    of 2021 by an additional 60 kg ha-1. Table 1. Sowing parameters of winter wheat.

    and diagnose the water deficit in winter wheat, an experiment was carried out
    from March to June in 2021 and 2022. The field was divided into 12 experimental
    zones, corresponding to 4 irrigation levels, namely HD (high deficit), MD (moderate
    deficit), SD (slight deficit), and LI (local irrigation). We chose the LI as a
    control irrigation level to find the differences among treatments resulting from
    irrigation levels based on local irrigation management. In the present study,
    the main root depth was within a range of 40 cm. Therefore, when the average soil
    water content (SWC) in 0–40 cm soil layer of LI treatment dropped to around 65%
    FC, all zones were irrigated. The irrigation amount of LI treatment was equivalent
    to the average water depth that could supplement current SWC to 100% FC. In total,
    the irrigation amount of LI treatment in 2021 and 2022 were 270 mm and 235 mm
    respectively, which included 30 mm of overwintering water on November 16, 2020
    and November 27, 2021. The irrigation rates for HD, MD, and SD treatments were
    set at 55%, 70%, and 85% of the irrigation rate applied in the LI treatment, respectively.
    In each experimental zone, 3 sampling plots of 6 m × 6 m were selected, resulting
    in a total of 36 plots. The specific experimental layout is shown in Fig. 1. Fig.
    2 shows the irrigation amount of the 4 treatments as well as the cumulative reference
    crop evapotranspiration (ET0, Penman-Monteith) and rainfall in the experiment.

    crop evapotranspiration. The overwintering water amount of 30 mm was applied on
    November 16, 2020 and November 27, 2021, respectively. To achieve variable rate
    irrigation, the experimental field was irrigated by a three-span center-pivot
    irrigation system with a radius of 140 m, which was equipped with solenoid valves,
    valve controllers, Beidou RTK receivers, and control software. The Beidou RTK
    receiver determined the position of the center pivot in the field for the real
    time identification of control zones. There were a total of 34 low-pressure sprinklers,
    and each sprinkler could be operated separately by turning the solenoid on or
    off. The designed application depths in specific control zones were obtained by
    changing the travel speed of the center pivot and the duty cycle of each solenoid
    valve (Hui et al., 2022) (Fig. 1). 2.2. UAV image acquisition 2.2.1. UAV remote
    sensing platform A DJI M300 Pro UAV (Shenzhen DJI Sciences and Technologies Ltd,
    Shenzhen, China) (maximum take-off weight of 9 kg, maximum payload 2.7 kg, maximum
    flight time of 55 min without payload) was equipped with a 5-band multispectral
    camera (MicaSense Red Edge-MX multispectral camera, AgEagle, Wichita, KS, USA)
    and a thermal infrared camera (DJI Zenmuse H20T). Flights were performed in clear
    sky and low wind speed conditions, between 11:00 and 13:00 local time. The DJI
    Pilot app was used for all flights planning, set at 75% forward and 75% side overlap
    in image acquisition for the thermal imagery. The flight height was 50 m and the
    flight speed was 2.1 m s-1. The flight time and flight conditions (see Section
    2.3.3 for a description of the weather station) are listed in Table 2. Table 2.

    the experimental area, and their exact location was retrieved with an RTK GNSS
    receiver (M600 mini, Compass Navigation, China). The adopted positioning protocol
    was Qianxun Find CM (Qianxun SI, China) with a horizontal accuracy of 2 cm and
    an elevation accuracy of 5 cm. 2.2.2. Multispectral camera The RedEdge-MX multispectral
    camera is a global shutter sensor with 5 spectral bands, namely in the blue (465–485 nm),
    green (550–570 nm), red (663–673 nm), red edge (712–722 nm), and near-infrared
    (820–860 nm) spectrum. The focal length is 5.5 mm, resulting in a field of view
    of 47.2° and ground sampling distance of 3.5 cm at 50 m flight height. During
    the flights, the camera was connected to the DLS-2 sensor, measuring GNSS position
    and downwelling light. The camera was set up to capture an image every 2 s. A
    standard grey panel (Calibrated Reflectance Panel (CRP), MicaSense) was photographed
    for radiometric correction before each flight. 2.2.3. Thermal camera Simultaneously,
    the Zenmuse H20T collected thermal images. It is an integrated camera that contains
    4 sensors for a radiometric thermal camera, a wide angle camera, a zoom camera
    and a laser rangefinder. The thermal imaging camera is a radiometric microbolometer
    camera with a single band sensitivity in the 8–14 µm spectral range, a temperature
    range of −40 to 150 °C, and a resolution of 640 × 512 pixels. Its lens has a focal
    length of 13.5 mm, resulting in a field of view of 40.6° and a ground sampling
    distance of 4.5 cm at 50 m flight height. Images were acquired every 2 s. The
    at-sensor radiance was converted into brightness temperature (Tbr, K) using the
    DJI Thermal SDK 1.2 software to perform the atmospheric correction, with the locally
    measured air temperature (Ta), relative humidity, and flight height. The surface
    temperature (Ts, K) was then calculated as Eq. 1 (Maes et al., 2017, Maes and
    Steppe, 2012): (1) T s = T br 4 − ( 1 − ε ) × T bg 4 ε 4 (2) T bg = 0.7 × T a
    4 4 In which ε is the emissivity, estimated as 0.99. Tbg is the background temperature
    (K), calculated from air temperature (K) as Eq. 2. 2.2.4. Data processing Pix4D
    Mapper (Pix4D 4.4, Pix4D S.A., Switzerland) was used to create orthomosaics with
    the coordinates of five GCPs as input for georeferencing. For the multispectral
    data, the software also converted the data to reflectance using the DLS2 and the
    grey reference panel measurement, which is a relatively reliable way for processing
    these data (Daniels et al., 2023). The multispectral and thermal orthomosaics
    were imported into QGIS 3.22 (QGIS Geographic Information System; Open Source
    Geospatial Foundation Project), which was used for all further GIS processing.
    Fourteen vegetation indices that are commonly used for crop growth monitoring
    were calculated from the multispectral orthomosaic (Table 3). From the thermal
    data, two thermal indices (TIs), including the difference between canopy temperature
    and air temperature (△T, ℃) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were calculated
    as follows ((3), (4)): (3) ∆ T = T s − T a (4) CWSI = T s − T pot T dry − T pot

    camera. With Tpot (℃) and Tdry (℃) corresponding to the surface temperature of
    a winter wheat plant transpiring at a maximal rate (Tpot) and not transpiring
    at all (Tdry). In this case, Tpot and Tdry were calculated directly per measurement
    day using the histogram method, as the 1st and 99th percentile the polygon records
    of that day (De Swaef et al., 2021). The histogram method can be applied in this
    case, since the different irrigation treatments guarantee that at least some completely
    unstressed and some severely stressed plants are present on each measurement day.
    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were converted to binary
    images by the vegetation index threshold (OTSU) (Otsu, 1979) to distinguish vegetation
    from soil background. Then, the average value for each VI and TI of each sample
    plot was extracted using the zonal statistics function. 2.3. Field data acquisition
    2.3.1. Stomatal conductance A leaf porometer (SC-1, METER, USA) was used to measure
    the stomatal conductance (GS) of three wheat flag leaves per plot from 11:00–13:00
    on the same day of the UAV flight. As recommended, the probe was regularly calibrated,
    and the sensor probe was kept horizontally during all measurements. 2.3.2. Soil
    water content A TDR device (Trime-T3, IMKO Ltd., Ettlingen, Germany) was used
    to monitor the soil water content (SWC) at depths of 0–20 cm and 20–40 cm. 36
    Trime tubes were buried at the center of each plot. The soil was extracted with
    a soil drill next to the trime tube to calibrate the TDR measurements. 2.3.3.
    Meteorological parameters During the remote sensing image acquisition, a hand-held
    meteorograph (4500 DT, Kestrel, USA) was used to measure the instantaneous meteorological
    data, including relative humidity, temperature, and wind speeds at 2 m height.
    Additionally, a weather station (HOBO U30, Onset Computer Co., MA, USA) was installed
    in the experimental area and hourly wind speed, precipitation, air temperature,
    relative humidity and solar radiation were collected. As shown in Table 1, air
    temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from a hand-held weather
    meteorograph, and solar radiation was obtained from the weather station. 2.4.
    Model establishment and accuracy evaluation 2.4.1. Calculation of water deficit
    indices To build the water regime training and testing models for wheat from separate
    datasets, the GS at each growth stage in the two-year experiment was normalized
    as NGS (Eq. 5). (5) NGS i = GS i GS max Where GSmax is the maximum value of GS
    measured in each growing season (547.5 mmol m-2 s-1 in 2021 and 575.4 mmol m-2
    s-1 in 2022). The effective soil water content (EWC) in the soil that can be utilized
    by crops was calculated as Eq. 6: (6) EWC i = SWC i − WP FC i − WP Where FCi is
    the field capacity of 0–40 cm soil layer of each plot (ranging from 0.21 to 0.24 cm3
    cm-3) and WP is the wilting point (WP=0.05 cm3 cm-3). 2.4.2. Machine learning
    modelling Due to the high collinearity between the vegetation indices, a Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the dimensions (Abdi and Williams,
    2010). The PCA was performed on the VIs and TIs measured in two years at each
    growth stage to determine important variables and the relationship between VIs
    and TIs. The PCA axes with a cumulative contribution rate of principal component
    variance above 98% were used as inputs of the winter wheat water stress prediction
    models. Three different machine learning algorithms were evaluated. PLS (Partial
    Least Squares) is a multivariate statistical data analysis method that combines
    the advantages of principal component analysis, canonical correlation analysis,
    and linear regression analysis (Abdi, 2010). SVM (Support Vector Machines) is
    a supervised machine learning algorithm that implements classification and regression
    by constructing a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional
    space (Cortes et al., 1995). GBDT (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees) is a commonly
    used ensemble learning algorithm. This algorithm trains multiple individual learners,
    and then combines them through certain strategies to form a strong learner, which
    has the characteristics of high fitting accuracy and strong interpretability (Friedman,
    2002). In this study, the number of iterations of GBDT was chosen as 100, and
    the learning rate was 0.1. The maximum depth of the regression tree was 7, the
    minimum number of leaf nodes samples was 5, and the maximum number of features
    was 3. The Principal Components (PCs) calculated for each growth stage in 2021
    were used as input to build NGS and EWC prediction models. To verify the applicability
    of the model, the PCs in 2022 for each growth stage were used to test the performance
    of the models. In addition, a separate analysis was performed in which the data
    of all different growth stages were pooled. We also constructed a separate model
    for pre-heading (tillering, jointing and booting stage) and post-heading stage
    (heading, flowering and filling stage). Finally, to compare the impact of multispectral
    and thermal images on the prediction accuracy of winter wheat growth parameters,
    models using only multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) were included as input,
    or using both VIs and thermal-based indices (VIs + TIs) were included. 2.4.3.
    Statistical analysis The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error
    (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) from (7), (8), (9) were
    used to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the models’ prediction results.
    Statistically, the higher R2 and the smaller RMSE and NRMSE, the higher the accuracy
    of a prediction model. The simulation effect evaluation was divided into four
    levels according to the NRMSE: excellent (NRMSE ≤ 10%), good (10%＜NRMSE ≤ 20%),
    suitable (20%＜NRMSE ≤ 30%), and poor (NRMSE＞30%). A schematic illustrating the

    3.1. Statistics of NGS and EWC of wheat under different irrigation treatments
    Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the variation of NGS and EWC of wheat under the different
    irrigation deficit treatments. In the tillering stage, the difference in NGS and
    EWC between the different treatments was still limited (ranging from 0.28 to 0.37
    in 2021 and from 0.27 to 0.41 in 2022 for NGS, and from 0.36 to 0.42 in 2021 and
    from 0.34 to 0.41 in 2022 for EWC, respectively). With the growth of wheat, these
    differences between irrigation treatments gradually increased, peaking in the
    flowering (NGS) and filling stages (EWC). The two-year experimental results have
    high synergy, which provided a favorable data set for the testing of the model.

    models of each growth stage showed the close correlation between NGS and EWC (Fig.
    5). Under water stress conditions, the transpiration rate of wheat decreased,
    so NGS decreased with the decrease of EWC. However, the regression models of the
    six growth stages were different. In the tillering and jointing stages, R2 varied
    slightly between 0.65 and 0.68. R2 increased significantly in booting and heading
    stages. For both years, the correlations were strongest at the flowering stage.

    insensitive pigment index) were positively correlated with NGS and EWC, whereas
    SIPI, △T, and CWSI were negatively correlated with these two variables. To clearly
    distinguish the correlation between the spectral variables and the canopy temperature
    indices with the two variables, the correlation coefficient r was taken as the
    absolute value(︱r︱) for analysis, and the following correlation coefficients were

    from T1 to T6. RVI, NDVI, NDRE, EVI, OSAVI, DVI, GNDVI,CIRE, EVI2, GOSAVI, MSR,

    vegetation index, red-edge chlorophyll index, enhanced vegetation index, green
    optimal soil adjusted vegetation index, modified simple ratio index, soil adjusted
    vegetation index, structure insensitive pigment index and red-edge vegetation
    index, respectively. △T and CWSI represent the difference between canopy temperature
    and air temperature, and crop water stress index, respectively. In the tillering
    stage, △T and CWSI had the highest correlation with NGS, while RVI (ratio vegetation
    index), NDVI, and GOSAVI (green optimal soil adjusted vegetation index) also showed
    good correlations with NGS. △T and CWSI also performed best in jointing and booting
    stages, followed closely by MSR (modified simple ratio index), RVI and NDVI. Some
    differences between both years were found in the heading stage, where MSR, RVI
    and NDVI were highly correlated with NGS in 2021, whereas △T and CWSI were most
    highly correlated with NGS in 2022. At flowering and filling stages, RVI, CIRE
    (red-edge chlorophyll index), MSR and RERVI (red-edge vegetation index) correlated
    most closely with NGS. Overall, RVI had the highest correlation throughout the
    entire growing season, for both years, closely followed by CWSI. The correlations
    between EWC, and VIs and TIs were slightly lower than those of NGS. In tillering
    and jointing stages, △T and CWSI were most highly correlated with EWC. However,
    RVI, MSR and GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index) showed a higher
    correlation with EWC than TIs in booting, heading and flowering stages. At filling
    stage, RVI and NDVI performed best in 2021and 2022, respectively. In summary,
    the correlation between TIs and NGS and EWC was slightly better than that of the
    VIs in the early growth stages, but this was less obvious in the late growth stages.
    Still, overall, CWSI was the most highly correlating variable throughout the entire
    season, and for both years. During the whole experimental period, VIs of RVI,
    MSR, and NDVI performed well with NGS and EWC. 3.3. Principal Components of PCA
    with VIs and VIs+TIs Fig. 7 shows the cumulative contribution of the PCs in the
    PCA analyses by VIs (a) and VIs+TIs (b). The cumulative contribution of the top
    4 PCA components reached over 98% for all PCA analyses. Therefore, we consider
    it appropriate to use 4 PCA components for VIs and VIs + TIs in this study to
    model NGS and EWC (Section 3.4 & 3.5). Download : Download high-res image (154KB)

    heading, flowering and filling, respectively. Pre and post represent pre-heading
    stage and post-heading stage, respectively. For the PCA on the VIs, 93.5% of the
    variation was explained by the first two components, in both pre-heading and post-heading
    stages. In the pre-heading stage, OSAVI (optimized soil adjusted vegetation index),
    GOSAVI, NDVI and NDRE (normalized difference red-edge) were strongly positively
    and SIPI strongly negatively correlated with PC1, with EVI (enhanced vegetation
    index) more correlated with PC2 (Fig. 8a). In the post-heading stage (Fig. 8b),
    the overall correlation pattern between the individual VIs was very similar, although
    they were less strongly correlated to PC1. The two first PC of the PCA on the
    VIs + TIs explained 85.7% and 87.6% of the variation in pre-heading and post-heading
    stages, respectively. In the pre-heading stage (Fig. 8c), nearly all VIs were
    very strongly correlated to PC1, and the two TIs to PC2. In the post-heading stage
    (Fig. 8d), the TIs were strongly correlated with several VIs (e.g., △T with SIPI,
    MSR and RVI; CWSI with GNDVI and NDRE). Consequently, both TIs were negatively
    correlated with PC1 and the PCA of VIs + TIs closely resembled the PCA of the
    VIs in this stage (Figs. 8b and 8d). Download : Download high-res image (403KB)

    3.4. Models simulating NGS The 4 PCA axes from VIs and VIs + TIs were used as
    input variables to construct NGS prediction models with PLS, SVM, and GBDT. This
    section only shows the results of the test set; the results of the training set
    can be found in the Appendix (Table A.1). The accuracy of the NGS prediction models
    varied at different growth stages (Fig. 9). None of the models performed well
    at tillering stage, but the model accuracy gradually increased for the jointing,
    booting, and heading stages. The prediction accuracy peaked at the flowering stage
    (R2＞0.80) and decreased during the filling stage. Combining all data from the
    pre-heading stage into a single model clearly increased the model performance,
    although overall performance was still lower (R2 =0.65–0.75) than that of the
    post-heading stage (R2 =0.84–0.88). Download : Download high-res image (355KB)

    respectively. Pre and Post represent pre-heading stage and post-heading stage,
    respectively. Compared to VIs, the combination of VIs and TIs consistently improved
    the prediction accuracy of NGS at all stages. R2 values improved from 0.74 to
    0.79 at pre-heading stage and from 0.87 to 0.90 at post-heading stage for the
    GBDT method. Among the three methods, PLS usually performed slightly worse, particularly
    in the early and later growth stages. For the individual growth stages, GBDT and
    SVM performed similarly. However, the GBDT model performed consistently best for
    the aggregate pre-heading and post-heading models. 3.5. Models simulating EWC
    With the aim of assessing the spatial variability of soil water availability in
    the large-scale field, this study constructed EWC prediction models by combining
    SWC, FC, and WP for the soil layers from 0 to 40 cm. The results of the training
    set can be found in Appendix (Table A.2), and the results of the independent test
    dataset are shown in Fig. 10. The results show large similarity with those of
    the NGS models: combining VIs and TIs consistently improved model performance,
    and the models of pre-heading and post-heading reached a good level (10%＜NRMSE
    ≤ 20%), with the post-heading model performing slightly better than the pre-heading
    model. The ensemble model in the pre-heading stage performed better than the individual
    stage models. PLS models had the lowest accuracy, and GBDT models overall had
    the highest accuracy. R2 was lower and RMSE and NRMSE were higher at the tillering
    and jointing stages. Different from the NGS models, the models achieved the best
    results in filling stage, with GBDT (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.05, NRMSE = 15.9%) as
    the best model. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download : Download

    indicators for characterizing crop water stress. Large-scale monitoring of crop
    water status based on UAV remote sensing technology is greatly important for wheat
    management. In this study, prediction models of NGS and EWC were constructed using
    VIs and TIs calculated from UAV spectral and thermal remote sensing to evaluate
    water stress of winter wheat. As expected, △T and CWSI were indeed more highly
    correlated with NGS and EWC than the VIs in the early growth stages, when the
    growth of the plants did not yet differ much between the treatments. Still, this
    study revealed that in the later growth stages, several VIs (e.g., RVI, RERVI
    and MSR) were even more closely correlated with NGS and EWC than the TIs. Following
    the lower correlation of VIs with NGS and EWC in the early stages, the performance
    of the models predicting the water stress variables was lower, particularly when
    only VIs were used as input (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). This study confirmed that the prediction
    accuracy of combining VIs and TIs by PCA as input was higher than when relying
    only on multispectral data. This is consistent with findings by Cheng et al. (2022)
    who predicted the soil water content in corn. Our study confirmed that the combination
    of multispectral and canopy temperature image datasets for water stress monitoring
    at key growth stages improved the accuracy of predictive models. Another study
    indicated that WDI derived from multispectral and thermal sensors is a reliable
    factor in assessing the water status of winter wheat (Antoniuk et al., 2023).
    Specifically, the WDI had a consistently high correlation with GS during the whole
    season (R2 ranged from 0.63 to 0.99). But their study lacked a truly independent
    test set, so the applicability of the model in different growth seasons still
    needs to be verified. In our study, the prediction accuracy of the NGS model first
    increased and then decreased with the growth of wheat, with optimal performance
    at flowering stage, in line with models predicting GS by Zhou et al. (2021), using
    solely multispectral remote sensing. However, the prediction accuracy of the EWC
    model showed a gradually increasing trend with the growth of wheat. This is probably
    because in the late stages of the growing season, SWC remained stable, whereas
    GS dropped during the filling stage (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This decrease during filling
    stage can be attributed to the weakening of leaf vitality (Xue et al., 2006).
    Conversely, the accumulated drought stress widened the gap of SWC between different
    irrigation treatments at filling stage. The accuracy of the models predicting
    NGS was overall higher than those targeting EWC. GS is a more direct indicator
    of plant water status and hence more closely related to VIs and TIs than SWC (Jones,
    2004). Similar to the findings of Zia et al. (2012), the models showed better
    performance in the post-heading than in the pre-heading stage. An interesting
    observation was that the ensemble pre-heading model performed better than the
    individual models in the tillering, jointing and booting stages, while the ensemble
    model accuracy of post-heading was not significantly improved. This may be due
    to the gradual growth of wheat before heading, which increases the canopy coverage.
    The results indicate that in the early stages, the relationship between on the
    one hand NGS, EWC and on the other hand VIs and TIs remains relatively stable.
    Technically, a model incorporating more data (from different growth stages) is
    more robust. Overall, the GBDT model outperformed the PLS and SVM models with
    higher R2, lower RMSE and NRMSE in NGS and EWC estimation for most of the wheat
    growth stages. This is in line with recent research that also found high precisions
    for the GBDT algorithm (Du et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2018). GBDT is an ensemble
    algorithm based on decision trees. Its basic learner is serially generated, that
    is, each new learner generated is based on the previous modeling results. Therefore,
    it can be used as a good single regression model, providing very robust prediction,
    excellent and stable model discrimination ability. The generated new learners
    are based on the previous modeling results (Obsie et al., 2020). In addition,
    each decision tree of GBDT only learns the prediction residual part of the observation
    data, which is less prone to over-fitting. The SVM can solve nonlinear problems
    by introducing kernel functions. Although it also shows high test set accuracy
    in some growth stages, the fitting accuracy was not as good as the GBDT method
    from the perspective of the entire growth seasons. PLS performed the worst, probably
    because it cannot handle the non-linear problem in water stress prediction well.
    These data were analyzed based on the four irrigation treatment levels, six growth
    stages, and two growing seasons. A completely independent data set, collected
    in a separate year, was used as test dataset. The results showed that the both
    models reached a good level, indicating the stability of the ensemble approaches
    on new data. Zhou et al. (2021) built a GS prediction model of winter wheat with
    R2 greater than 0.80 by combining the multispectral vegetation indices and texture
    features. However, the study used the dataset of the flowering stage of a single
    growing season for training and testing of the model. Similarly, Qin et al. (2022)
    and Cheng et al. (2022) built predictive models for wheat GS and maize SWC respectively,
    but no truly independent dataset was used in their research. Our model results
    can be used in other growth seasons or independent datasets to diagnose water
    stress in wheat. In addition, compared with the single growth stage, two independent
    models (pre-heading and post-heading stage) achieved acceptable test set results,
    which provided a reference for irrigation plans. These models can reliably estimate
    NGS and EWC without the need to define the growth stage in detail. Therefore,
    modelling NGS and EWC for wheat at these two growth periods is straightforward,
    without requiring models for each growth stage. In addition, this study accurately
    controlled the amount of irrigation in the two growing seasons, thereby expanding
    the range of NGS and EWC, and achieving good test set results. Despite the independent
    dataset gathered in a separate year, the current study was performed within a
    single field and with a single variety of wheat. Different varieties of wheat
    as well as differences in climate and soil characteristics could affect the relationship
    between VIs, TIs and stomatal control. Hence, future studies should focus on implementing
    the models that combine multiple sites and varieties to extend those outcomes.
    Nonetheless, the determination of crop surface canopy temperature for both severely
    stressed and unstressed plants was ascertained by analyzing the 1 % and 99 % quantiles
    of the thermal image''s histogram captured on the respective flying day. However,
    it should be acknowledged that this simplified methodology may not be universally
    applicable, particularly in cases where vegetated areas do not exhibit pronounced
    water deficiency. This limitation arises from the inherent inability to establish
    a baseline for CWSI. The OTSU was employed to segregate the vegetation from the
    soil background. However, a comprehensively comparative analysis of the impact
    of distinct methodologies on model accuracy was not compared in this study. Furthermore,
    sandy soil, such as presentin the experimental site, drains faster than loamy
    or clay soil. Consequently, the canopy temperature of sandy soil tends to exhibit
    higher temperatures under water stress conditions. In prospective investigations,
    the best method for distinguishing between soil and vegetation in sandy soils
    should be studied. This refinement will enable better application of histogram
    analysis to discriminate between non-transpiring and fully transpiring crops.
    Additionally, wheat water deficit diagnostic models were constructed based solely
    on UAV multispectral and thermal remote sensing. For precision irrigation, winter
    wheat water stress map (Fig. 11) still needs to be converted into a task map of
    irrigation requirements, for which it is also necessary to include climatic conditions
    or soil properties in the decision process. Download : Download high-res image

    field experiment was conducted. The stomatal conductance and soil water content
    during the critical growth stages of wheat were monitored, and the water stress
    of wheat was assessed based on UAV multispectral and thermal remote sensing. The
    results showed that temperature indices (TIs, △T and CWSI) had a higher correlation
    with normalized stomal conductance (NGS) and effective water content (EWC) in
    the early growth stage, while RVI, CIRE, MSR, GNDVI, and RERVI from vegetation
    indices (VIs) performed better in the late growth stage. In this study, data from
    different growing seasons were used to construct the training and testing sets
    of the model. The gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method exhibited higher
    performance compared to partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machine
    (SVM), and the NGS could be better predicted than EWC. Combining VIs and TIs effectively
    improved the prediction accuracy of the NGS and EWC models. R2 increased from
    0.83 to 0.88 (NGS) and 0.77–0.81 (EWC) at the flowering stage by GBDT method.
    Overall, this study provides robust models to diagnose water deficit comprehensively
    and accurately in winter wheat using UAV remote sensing. CRediT authorship contribution

- analysis: 'The paper titled "Surface soil moisture estimation in bare agricultural
    soil using modified Dubois model for Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data" addresses the
    point of "Considerations: volume, frequency, format, and source of the data" by
    utilizing the Modified Dubois Model (MDM), which is an empirical model for radar
    scattering from bare soil surfaces. The study employed the MDM to derive soil
    moisture from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data and evaluated its performance against
    in-situ soil moisture measurements collected from agricultural fields.

    The paper''s relevance to the point lies in its investigation of the modified
    Dubois model and its application to Sentinel-1 SAR data for surface soil moisture
    estimation. The authors provide a detailed description of the MDM and its implementation,
    contributing to the understanding of data sources, formats, and methodologies
    for soil moisture estimation.

    The paper''s insights are primarily focused on the performance of the MDM in estimating
    soil moisture, as it demonstrates a strong correlation between model-derived soil
    moisture and ground-based soil moisture measurements (R2 = 0.85). The study also
    evaluates the sensitivity of the MDM to different soil moisture ranges. The results
    suggest that the model performs well for bare soil moisture estimation, even for
    lower ranges of surface soil moisture, providing valuable insights into the model''s
    capabilities.

    The credibility of the paper is supported by its rigorous methodology, which includes
    field data collection, data processing, and statistical analysis. The authors
    present a comprehensive analysis of the MDM''s performance, including scatterplots,
    error metrics, and sensitivity analysis. The paper also cites relevant literature
    and acknowledges the limitations and potential improvements of the study.

    Overall, the paper provides a relevant and insightful analysis of the Modified
    Dubois Model for surface soil moisture estimation, contributing to the understanding
    of data sources, formats, and methodologies in the context of irrigation management.'

  description: Surface soil moisture has vital role in water energy balance, climate
    change and agriculture mainly for crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling.
    Microwave remote sensing with its unique characteristics of high penetration and
    sensitivity towards dielectric constant, has enabled the researchers to explore
    various techniques for soil moisture estimation. With the launch of Sentinel-1
    (A&B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, the hindrance in accessing high
    spatial and temporal resolution data is eliminated. The current study focuses
    on surface soil moisture estimation for bare agricultural fields in the semi-arid
    region. Field soil moisture up to 5 cm depth using HydraGo Probe sensor and surface
    roughness synchronizing with satellite pass dates were collected from total 102

    Model, Surface roughness , radar backscatter Abstract Surface soil moisture has
    vital role in water energy balance, climate change and agriculture mainly for
    crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling. Microwave remote sensing with
    its unique characteristics of high penetration and sensitivity towards dielectric
    constant, has enabled the researchers to explore various techniques for soil moisture
    estimation. With the launch of Sentinel-1 (A&B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
    satellites, the hindrance in accessing high spatial and temporal resolution data
    is eliminated. The current study focuses on surface soil moisture estimation for
    bare agricultural fields in the semi-arid region. Field soil moisture up to 5
    cm depth using HydraGo Probe sensor and surface roughness synchronizing with satellite
    pass dates were collected from total 102 locations spanning four dates. Volumetric
    and sensor-based soil moisture are well correlated with R2 = 0.85. The Modified
    Dubois Model (MDM) was applied to obtain the relative permittivity of the soil
    for the backscattering coefficient (σ◦) for VV polarization, which is used as
    one of the inputs in universal Topp’s model for soil moisture calculation. Model
    derived soil moisture is well correlated with ground-based soil moisture for the
    entire range of the soil moisture (0.02-0.18 m3m-3) with R2 = 0.85 and RMSE=0.005.
    The entire soil moisture was categorized in three soil moisture ranges to evaluate
    the sensitivity. The highest correlation was observed for 0.06-0.1 m3m-3 with
    R2 = 0.73 and RMSE=0.003 followed by 0.015-0.6 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.81 and RMSE=0.001
    and 0.11-0.18 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.48 and RMSE=0.019 which is significantly low.

    even the lower range of surface soil moisture. References Baghdadi, N., Choker,

    High-resolution soil moisture (SM) products are crucial for managing water in
    agricultural regions, irrigation scheduling, and land–atmosphere model simulations.
    Most satellite-based SM products have spatial resolutions in the tens of kilometers,
    which cannot satisfy the aforementioned applications, and there is an urgent need
    to disaggregate them to fine spatial resolutions. Currently, disaggregation method
    based on multi-source data fusion tend to be robust, but the following difficulties

    in space and time which hinder the applications; 2) only one model-based product
    is used in the fusion process and different model-based products were not sufficiently
    evaluated. To overcome these problems, this work developed an SM disaggregation
    methodology. The best model-based SM product was first assessed using the triple
    collocation (TC) method, which allows us to obtain the weight of individual product.
    The model-based and microwave SM products were combined based on weight to produce

    1. Introduction The regulation of water-heat exchange at the land–atmosphere interface
    is significantly impacted by soil moisture (SM), thus making it an essential climatic
    and ecological variable (Humphrey et al., 2021). In agriculture, excessive SM
    lead to waterlogging, while insufficient SM result in drought (Liu et al., 2018).
    Both conditions adversely affect crop growth, highlighting the close relationship
    between SM and food security. In terms of land surface/hydrological modeling,
    the assimilation of SM data improves model state estimation (Yin et al., 2023).
    Additionally, SM can be used as a constraint to parameterize the model to prevent
    the phenomenon of “same result with different parameters” (Rajib et al., 2016).
    In climate, existing research indicates that SM significantly improves rainfall
    forecast, especially in extreme events (van den Hurk et al., 2012). Moreover,
    spatiotemporally continuous SM is beneficial to climate change analysis (Seneviratne
    et al., 2010). All these domains necessitate SM data with high spatiotemporal
    resolution, precision, and continuity to serve their application needs. Since
    soil dielectric constant measured by microwave is directly correlated with SM,
    and the microwave band has the characteristics of all-day, all-weather measurement
    and penetration of vegetation (Ulaby et al., 1981), it is widely regarded as the
    primary wavelength for SM monitoring (Ma et al., 2023). Microwave satellites have
    two different types of sensors: active (radar, scatterometer) and passive (radiometer-based).
    Although the active microwave has a high spatial resolution, it is susceptible
    to factors such as surface roughness, vegetation, and speckle noise, and has a
    relatively long satellite revisit period (Ambrosone et al., 2020, Wang et al.,
    2022). In contrast, the passive microwave technique offers a high temporal resolution
    and its retrieval algorithms are more mature, yet its application is restricted
    to the resolution of tens of kilometers. In addition, it is possible to create
    model-based SM products with spatial integrity and temporal continuity by utilizing
    data assimilation techniques and driving land surface models. However, like passive
    microwave data, model-based products also have relatively coarse spatial resolution.
    For example, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) resolution is 0.25°
    (Rodell et al., 2004), the ERA5-Land resolution is 0.1° (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019),
    and China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS)
    has a resolution of 0.0625° (Shi et al., 2011). More importantly, improper parameter
    settings, model structure, and the forcing data uncertainty, affect the accuracy
    of the products and require evaluation of various model-based products in different
    regions (Fan et al., 2022, Zeng et al., 2015). Due to the coupled influence of
    human activity, underlying surface conditions, and climate change, SM exhibits
    significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Coarse spatial resolution microwave
    and model-based products are not entirely capable of describing this heterogeneity,
    and need to be disaggregated to produce SM products with higher spatiotemporal
    resolution. Currently, there are three main disaggregation methods (Peng et al.,
    2017, Qu et al., 2020). The first is based on geospatial information data (Ranney
    et al., 2015), but it requires a large amount of station data to establish the
    relationship. The second is model-based approach, including statistical model
    (Kim and Barros, 2002) and land surface/hydrological model (Vergopolan et al.,
    2020). However, statistical models are not universally applicable, and the process
    of constructing land surface/hydrological models is complex, requiring a substantial
    amount of driving data. The third is a multi-source data fusion approach, which
    has been extensively used in recent disaggregation studies. For example, Song
    et al. disaggregated the AMSR-2 data to 1 km by geographically weighted regression
    (Song et al., 2019). To disaggregate SMAP observations, Wei et al. employed a
    gradient-boosted decision-tree regression model through a high-resolution SM index
    (Wei et al., 2019). Long et al. leveraged microwave and CLDAS SM products as background
    fields, and developed an effective SM disaggregation method by random forest (Long
    et al., 2019). Based on remote sensing, ERA5-Land, and in-situ data, Huang et
    al. generated a spatiotemporally continuous surface SM product (Huang et al.,
    2022). However, there are three main limitations to existing disaggregation studies
    based on multi-source data fusion in obtaining highly accurate, high spatiotemporal
    resolution and spatially complete SM products: 1) some studies disaggregated individual
    passive microwave SM product (e.g., SMAP, AMSR-2). However, such passive products
    suffer from spatial and temporal missing due to their operation orbit and revisit
    intervals, hence the derived disaggregation products also inherit these deficiencies.
    Some studies have addressed this issue by introducing model-based data, but they
    do not evaluate different model-based products to choose the most suitable one
    for the study region; 2) many studies employ machine learning techniques to merge
    various SM products. However, the internal mechanisms of machine learning are
    not as well defined and it is difficult to accurately characterize the error in
    each product; 3) optical/infrared products as auxiliary data are susceptible to
    impacts from cloud masking, atmospheric effects, and vegetation coverage, resulting
    in invalid grids. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this study contributes
    to the following three components: 1) three mainstream model-based SM products
    (GLDAS, CLDAS, and ERA5-Land) were individually combined with microwave active
    and passive data to form three sets of triplets. Through triple collocation (TC)
    analysis, the model-based products were compared, and the product with the smallest
    error was selected; 2) depending on the error variance derived from triple collocation
    analysis, the selected model-based, microwave active, and microwave passive products
    were optimally fused through least squares merging and Pearson correlation-based
    determination scheme to produce reliable 25 km daily seamless SM products; 3)
    the temporal correlation and spectral similarity among images were explored by
    spatiotemporal interpolation and the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance
    fusion model (ESTARFM) to complement the missing in optical/infrared products
    and generate daily seamless auxiliary data at 1 km. Finally, the geographically
    weighted regression (GWR) model with local regression capability was employed
    to disaggregate the 25 km TC-merged product by the auxiliary data, resulting in
    daily seamless SM product at 1 km. 2. Study area The Shandian River Basin, which
    is in the intersection of Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    in China, was chosen as the study area (Fig. 1). This area boasts a diverse range
    of land cover types that includes farmland, grasslands, forests, and small amounts
    of shrubs and bare land. The climatic type of the study area is temperate continental,
    characterized by cold, dry winters and wet, rainy summers, with an average annual
    precipitation of 300–500 mm. As a result, there are significant seasonal variations
    in SM (Wang et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (987KB) Download

    and 10 km. As this study involves different scales of SM products (25 km, 6.25
    km, and 1 km), the area can satisfy different scales of product validation. Decagon
    5TM SM sensors are used at each station, and measurements are taken at five depths.
    In this study, the 5 cm depth data is used to match the SM products. In addition,
    the final study range was chosen between 41° − 43°N and 115° − 117.5°E to facilitate
    data fusion. 3. Data and methodology 3.1. Multi-source soil moisture and auxiliary
    data 3.1.1. Microwave soil moisture The ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project
    provided the microwave SM products used in this study, which includes active,
    passive, and combined products at 25 km. Annual updates by the CCI SM team have
    resulted in 13 releases so far, each of which added new sensors and extended the
    time series (Gruber et al., 2019). In this study, both active and passive microwave
    products were selected to participate in the triple collocation calculations,
    they include mainstream active and passive sensors. 3.1.2. Model-based soil moisture
    (i) CLDAS The CLDAS product depends on data fusion and assimilation methods by
    atmospheric products to drive different land surface models, and in turn the values
    simulated by these models are ensemble averaged to obtain the surface state variables.
    The CLDAS near real-time SM product was chosen for this study, with 0.0625° spatial
    resolution at a daily or hourly time scale. To match the microwave data, the daily
    data from 0 to 5 cm depth was selected and resampled to 25 km. Moreover, hourly
    CLDAS land surface temperature (LST) was used in the ESTARFM fusion process. (ii)
    GLDAS The GLDAS product is developed by NASA to provide an optimal field for land
    surface conditions and fluxes, it contains the products of three land surface
    models (Catchment, VIC, and Noah). This study used SM product simulated by Noah
    model, which vertically divided into four layers with 0.25° spatial resolution
    at 3-hour temporal scale. Similarly, to match the satellite products, the top
    layer (0–10 cm) was selected, and the 3-hour data were averaged on a daily scale.
    (iii) ERA5-Land ERA5-Land product has higher spatial and temporal resolutions
    (0.1°, hourly), more output parameters, more advanced forecast models, and data
    assimilation technology than ERA5. This study utilized the top layer (0–7 cm)
    of the ERA5-Land SM product. Same as the aforementioned product, the ERA5-Land
    product was resampled to 25 km and temporally averaged to a daily scale. 3.1.3.
    Auxiliary data (i) MODIS products The nighttime MYD11A1 product offered the LST
    in this study, which has a local overpass time of around 1:30 AM. For the enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI), by combining 16-day EVI data from MYD13A2 and MOD13A2,
    an 8-day EVI product at 1 km can be obtained. Furthermore, the land cover type
    product (MCD12Q1) was used and the IGBP classification layer was chosen to participate
    in the error calculation. (ii) DEM The multi-temporal interpolation and GWR disaggregation
    process used the STRM Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as auxiliary data. 3.2.
    Methodology The method of this study comprises three parts (Fig. 2): 1) assessment
    of the optimal model-based product and analysis of each product''s error variance
    using the TC methods. Based on error variance, the model-based, active microwave,
    and passive microwave products are optimally merged to produce a daily seamless
    SM product at 25 km; 2) development of daily seamless EVI product by linear interpolation
    and daily seamless LST product through iterative multi-temporal reconstruction
    and ESTARFM method, forming a 1 km seamless auxiliary dataset; 3) utilization
    of the GWR method to disaggregate the TC-merged product by the auxiliary dataset
    and ultimately obtaining a 1 km daily seamless SM product. Download : Download

    disaggregated methodology to obtain 1 km daily seamless SM by combining triple
    collocation, iterative multi-temporal interpolation, and geographically weighted
    regression. 3.2.1. Developing 25 km daily seamless soil moisture To produce the
    25 km daily seamless SM product, all products were first bias corrected to unify
    the value ranges, and then the optimal model-based product was evaluated by the
    triple collocation algorithm, while the error variance of each product was obtained.
    According to the error variance, the least squares merging technique was used
    to further calculate each product''s weight. Finally, for a more reliable merge,
    data were merged under different scenarios by considering the relevant significance
    levels. (i) Bias correction Differences in sensor frequency, observation principles,
    and inversion algorithms lead to certain systematic biases among different SM
    products. This study applied the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching
    technique to eliminate statistical moment differences between the two datasets
    (Reichle and Koster, 2004). Since model-based data have high spatiotemporal continuity,
    they are widely used as reference data in bias correction. All SM products involved
    in TC calculations were matched with model-based products by the CDF technique,
    so that they had the same value range and distribution. In addition, the reference
    data quality affects the merged product’s accuracy (Afshar et al., 2019), therefore
    it is necessary to evaluate different model-based products. (ii) Evaluation and
    uncertainty estimation of model-based products The TC method has the advantage
    of not relying on “true values” and can estimate the error of each product independently.
    This method has been extensively applied to calculate errors of hydrological variables
    such as precipitation (Lyu et al., 2021), evapotranspiration (Khan et al., 2018),
    and SM (Gruber et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2023, Wu et al., 2021). It is called “triple
    collocation” because the three data need to be paired together to form a triple
    in the calculation. An important principle of triple collocation is that the errors
    between the data must be uncorrelated. In this study, three triplets were constructed,
    namely 1) CLDAS - passive - active, 2) GLDAS - passive- active, and 3) ERA5-Land
    - passive- active. In each triplet, the data are model-based, passive microwave,
    and active microwave, which have different data sources and algorithms, thus fulfilling
    the prerequisite of uncorrelated errors. Moreover, these three triplets make three
    model-based products comparable. By comparing the results of three triplets, it
    is possible to assess the best model-based product and to obtain the relative
    error between each product. The calculation of TC is categorized into difference
    and covariance methods. This study chose the covariance method, which assumes
    the following principles between SM products and “true value”: 1) they are linearly
    correlated; 2) they are independent of each other in terms of error. According
    to the formula of covariance, the final formula of error variance () is: (1) where
    is random error variance, and are the variance of product and covariance between
    products, respectively. represent three SM products after CDF matching. Moreover,
    the following two points should be considered during TC calculation: 1) only grids
    with more than 100 samples in the time series retained for analysis; otherwise
    the results may be unreliable (Scipal et al., 2010); 2) when the error variance
    of one of the products is less than zero, the results of other products are not
    credible. Both cases may result in invalid grids. To ensure full coverage of the
    error variance, this study assigned the average error variance of valid grids
    in a given land cover type to the invalid grids of the same type. (iii) Weight
    estimation This study adopted the least squares merging method to estimate weights,
    which has been effectively used to merge SM (Gruber et al., 2017, Zeng et al.,
    2016), rainfall (Dong et al., 2020), and terrestrial water storage (Yin and Park,
    2021) products. The aim of least squares merging is to obtain the smallest error
    variance () of merged products and thus achieve an optimal merging of the different
    data, which takes the following form based on the TC estimates: (2) where is the
    weight of each product, and is the error variance calculated by the TC method.
    To obtain unbiased combined results, the sum of is 1. Then: (3) Letting and equal
    0, the weights for each product are: (4) When only two products are available,
    the weights for each product change to the following form: (5) (iv) Merging scheme
    considering significance levels The SM product generated in this study needed
    to meet two criteria: seamlessness and reliability. However, apart from the two
    unreliable situations mentioned in section 3.1.2, a weak correlation between one
    product in the triplet and the other two indicates a lower temporal coverage or
    poorer quality for that product, which would result in a low spatial coverage
    of the merged product. Hence, a scheme considering the relevant significance level
    (p-value < 0.05) was adopted to fulfill the seamless requirement of the merged
    product, which has been applied in previous studies (Gruber et al., 2017, Peng
    et al., 2021). The merging scheme is grid-based and consists of four scenarios
    (Table 1): 1) when all products are significantly correlated, a weighted average
    based on TC weights is used; 2) when a product shows strong correlation with two
    others, the value of that product is chosen; 3) when only two products are significantly
    correlated, the average value of these is calculated; and 4) when there is no
    significant correlation between the three products, the grid is generally ignored.
    For full spatial coverage, we filled in the gaps by utilizing model-based products
    that have continuity in both temporal and spatial. Table 1. Pearson correlation-based

    Generating 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data The objective of this section is
    to generate 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data. First, daily seamless EVI data
    were obtained through Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering (Savitzky and Golay, 1964)
    and linear interpolation methods. Second, seamless LST data were acquired by an
    iterative multi-temporal interpolation algorithm, and then the LST data were further
    extended to a daily scale by introducing the ESTARFM method. (i) Daily seamless
    EVI In this study, high-quality 16-day MODIS EVI (MYD13A2 and MOD13A2) products
    were selected. They were quality controlled and SG filtered to remove unreliable
    grids and then combined to generate an 8-day EVI. Moreover, linear interpolation
    was performed on the 8-day EVI in the time series to obtain daily seamless EVI,
    as there is a certain phenological regularity of vegetation growth. (ii) Daily
    seamless LST (a) Iterative multi-temporal interpolation The multi-temporal interpolation
    method supposes that the LST variation is highly consistent across grids with
    similar seasonal, elevation, and vegetation conditions (Song et al., 2019, Yu
    et al., 2015). Assuming a linear relationship between the variables, the following
    relationship exists between the two LST images obtained at close date intervals
    ( and ): (6) where is the EVI image on day, , , , and represent coefficients.
    According to the above principle, the LST images were first quality-controlled
    to remove unreliable grids. The LST images with above 90 % clear-sky grids were
    served as reference images (), and all images were the target images for interpolation
    (). The time interval between and was limited to 30 days to prevent significant
    seasonal changes. If this condition was not met, images from adjacent years were
    substituted. In addition, this study fully utilized all reference images with
    temporal intervals from the target image less than 30 days to perform an iterative
    interpolation operation. According to the principle of proximity of time intervals,
    the ones with shorter intervals were given priority. (b) ESTARFM Although seamless
    LST images can be obtained through iterative multi-temporal interpolation, the
    prerequisite is that the interpolated image must have LST values corresponding
    to the reference image. However, the proportion of clear-sky grids over the entire
    study area is zero on certain dates, these images cannot be processed by multi-temporal
    interpolation. Therefore, ESTARFM was introduced to deal with these dates, which
    takes the time trend of reflectance variations into account and integrates spectral
    and geographic similarities to reconstruct each grid. This method effectively
    fuses high-spatial and low-temporal resolution images with high-temporal and low-spatial
    resolution images to obtain high-spatiotemporal resolution data. It has been widely
    applied in the data fusion field (Abowarda et al., 2021, Long et al., 2020), and
    more descriptions of this model can be found in Zhu et al. (Zhu et al., 2010).
    In this study, the seamless interpolated LST (1 km, some dates missing) data were
    extended to the daily scale using the ESTARFM method by the CLDAS LST (∼6.25 km,
    daily) product. After the above process, all images had 99 % or higher clear-sky
    LST grids. To generate a seamless LST image, the remaining missing grids were
    filled by the inverse distance interpolation (IDW) method. 3.2.3. GWR disaggregation
    The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model utilizes regression coefficients
    to investigate spatially non-stationary relationships between variables (Brunsdon
    et al., 1996). In contrast to simple global regression methods, GWR follows the
    idea of local regression and the first law of geography. It calculates the weight
    relationship between each sample point and the target sample point by introducing
    a distance decay function to obtain the regression coefficient value. In recent
    years, there have been many studies using the GWR method to disaggregate different
    variables such as precipitation (Chen et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015), water storage
    changes (Chen et al., 2023), land surface temperature (Duan and Li, 2016, Wu et
    al., 2019), and soil moisture (Jin et al., 2018, Song et al., 2019). The formula
    for GWR is: (7) where are the locations of the ith grid, and denote the dependent
    and the kth independent variable of grid i, respectively. m is the total number
    of independent variables, denotes the residuals. and are the constant term and
    regression coefficients, respectively, they are calculated from: (8) where is
    the unbiased estimate of , X and Y represent the multi-dimensional and one-dimensional
    matrices of the independent and dependent variables, respectively. is a spatial
    weighting matrix, and T denotes the transpose. In this study, SM was the dependent
    variable, the daily seamless LST and EVI were obtained in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2,
    and DEM data were used as independent variables. The reasons for choosing these
    three factors are: 1) LST is related to water evaporation, the higher the LST,
    the faster the rate of evaporation; 2) EVI indicates the growth law of plants,
    which reduces evaporation and retains water in the soil; and 3) DEM affects water
    significantly, such as there is a significant difference between the water level
    of the shaded and sunny slopes. Many previous studies have selected these three
    factors to disaggregate SM (Hu et al., 2020, Song et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2019).
    This study also attempted to include other variables, such as slope factor, but
    the fitting effect did not significantly improve. Moreover, too many variables
    will lead to overfitting problems. Therefore, LST, EVI, and DEM were ultimately
    selected as independent variables. GWR was implemented by first resampling the
    LST, EVI, and DEM data to 25 km and fitting them to the merged data to produce
    the coefficients and residuals in Eq. (7). Then, the coefficients and residuals
    were interpolated to 1 km by cubic spline interpolation. Finally, the 1 km seamless
    daily SM product was obtained based on 1 km ancillary data. 4. Results and discussions
    4.1. Evaluation of model-based products To eliminate the influence caused by the
    choice of different reference data, this study rotated three products (CLDAS,
    GLDAS, and ERA5-Land) as reference data, yielding three groups of error results
    (Table 2). In general, the errors of passive and active data from different triplets
    should not differ significantly under the same reference data. However, as mentioned
    in section 3.1.2, when a product in a grid had a negative error variance, the
    results for the other products were invalid. This resulted in an inconsistent
    number of valid grids in different triplets, and the study area has a total of
    80 grids at 25 km scale. Therefore, the errors in active and passive data slightly
    differ across different triplets. Table 2. Error statistics of different triplets
    in the triple collocation. Group Reference product Triplet Error Number of valid
    grids Model-based CCI Passive CCI Active (1) CLDAS (C) C-P-A 0.021 0.042 0.033

    Land (E) C-P-A 0.019 0.028 0.022 67 G-P-A 0.027 0.026 0.024 67 E-P-A 0.048 0.025
    0.030 54 Note: P and A denote ESA CCI passive and active soil moisture product,
    respectively. For intra-group comparison, the C - P - A and G - P - A triplets
    have almost the same number of valid grids, so there is little difference between
    the errors in active and passive data in these two triplets. For example, in the
    first group, the error values for the passive products obtained from the C - P
    - A and G - P - A are 0.042 and 0.038, respectively, which only differ by 0.004.
    However, the number of valid grids for the E - P - A triplet is considerably lower,
    indicating that ERA5-Land may be unsuitable for TC analysis in this study. Moreover,
    comparing the three triplets in each group, ERA5-Land has the largest error and
    the CLDAS product has the smallest error, which supports the conclusion that CLDAS
    is more appropriate for China as it uses high-quality meteorological forcing data
    (Qin et al., 2017). Therefore, this study selected CLDAS as reference data and
    performed TC analysis with the CLDAS - passive -active combination. Based on the
    error results, the three products were fused to obtain a seamless daily SM product
    at 25 km. 4.2. Analysis of the merged microwave retrieved and model-based SM product
    To investigate the spatiotemporal variations of four SM products (CLDAS, CCI passive,
    CCI active, and TC-merged data), this study utilized Hovmöller diagram (Hovmöller,
    1949), which averages all values located at the same longitude/latitude, and is
    divided into a longitude/latitude axis showing spatial heterogeneity and a time
    axis indicating temporal variation. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 illustrate the spatiotemporal
    variations and coverage of the four SM products across latitudes and longitudes
    from 2019 to 2020, respectively. Numerically, the four products exhibited consistent
    trends in the time series: the soil began to freeze in November each year, resulting
    in low SM values, and as the temperature increased in March of the following year,
    the soil thawed and SM gradually increased. Overall, the active data had higher
    values, followed by the passive data, while CLDAS and TC-merged data had lower
    values. As latitude or longitude increased, no obvious change occurred in SM values,
    possibly due to the averaging process reducing spatial heterogeneity. In addition,
    the ESA CCI data were relatively scattered, with noticeable “jumps” between adjacent
    grids, whereas model-based and TC-merged data have a more continuous spatial distribution.
    This is because the model-based data were simulated from land surface models,
    which have the advantage of spatiotemporal continuity, the TC-merged data inherited
    this property. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download

    TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI Active, and CCI Passive SM products from 2019 to 2020. In
    terms of spatiotemporal coverage, although the Hovmöller diagrams average all
    grids along the same longitude and latitude, there are still significant data
    gaps in both active and passive data (gray areas in Fig. 3, Fig. 4), mostly concentrated
    between November and March of the following year. There could be several factors
    for the data gaps in the microwave data, including (1) the validity of backscattering
    coefficients and brightness temperature; (2) the inability of radiative transfer
    models to converge in retrieving SM; (3) radio frequency interference (RFI); and
    (4) the impacts of freezing and thawing on soil. In summary, TC-merged data combines
    the strengths of the high spatiotemporal coverage of CLDAS with the high accuracy
    of microwave data. 4.3. Analysis of interpolated LST 4.3.1. Evolution of the interpolation
    process Fig. 5 illustrates the evolution of clear-sky grid coverage for LST data
    after each step of interpolation. For ease of presentation, only 2019 is depicted.
    Fig. 5 (a) displays the original clear-sky grid coverage of each LST image. The
    distribution of the points in the figure is highly dispersed, revealing varying
    degrees of missing data in the LST data. Among these images, a total of 98 images
    with clear-sky grid coverage over 90 % were selected as reference images for iterative
    multi-temporal interpolation. Fig. 5 (b) indicates that after iterative multi-temporal
    interpolation, the proportion of clear-sky grid in the LST image has been significantly
    improved, with most of them reaching 100 % and the rest around 99 %. Download

    Original (a) and interpolated coverage (b and c) for MODIS LST data in 2019. However,
    for images with zero ratio of the clear-sky grid (points with zero value in Fig.
    5 (b)), there is no LST value as a reference. Therefore, multi-temporal interpolation
    could not be employed. To address this issue, the ESTARFM method was introduced
    in this study, where MODIS LST data with zero proportion (15 days in total) were
    treated as high-resolution images and CLDAS LST data served as low-resolution
    data. MODIS LST values for the same day were predicted from the CLDAS LST images.
    In addition, to be consistent with the acquisition time of MODIS data at 1:30
    a.m., CLDAS LST measurements at 1:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. were averaged. After the
    above steps, only a few images had a small number of missing grids, which were
    filled in by the IDW algorithm. Eventually, 100 % clear-sky grid coverage was
    achieved for all images (Fig. 5 (c)), producing a 1 km daily seamless LST product.
    4.3.2. Validation of the interpolated LST This study used the CLDAS LST to evaluate
    the interpolated data, the quality of this dataset exceeds that of its international
    counterparts in China, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.8 K and an average
    correlation value of 0.98 when compared to ground-based measurements, thus providing
    a reliable validation data. At 1 km scale, the study area consists of 50,000 grids,
    and the correlation (R) between interpolated LST and CLDAS LST on the time series
    was calculated grid by grid. As shown in Fig. 6, the average correlation is 0.931,
    and most of the correlations reached above 0.9. These results demonstrate the
    validity and applicability of the interpolated LST data, which can serve as auxiliary
    data in the SM disaggregation process. Download : Download high-res image (187KB)

    the interpolated LST and EVI products involved in the disaggregation process,
    respectively, which assist in the product analysis. In addition, the first to

    variations of each product. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    (Disaggregated, TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI Passive, and CCI Active), interpolated LST
    and EVI data. Regarding the temporal trends, the five SM products exhibited similar
    patterns: in winter, the SM values were lower on January 23 because of frozen
    soil and sparse vegetation. Then, SM increased on April 21 as soil temperatures
    rose and snowmelt occurred. In summer, temperatures and evaporation rates continue
    to increase. However, as shown in the EVI figure, the lush vegetation growth in
    summer helps to reduce evaporation and increase water retention in soil. As a
    result, SM values peaked on July 23. Finally, SM gradually decreased as precipitation
    decreased and vegetation withered in the autumn. Compared to other SM products,
    the disaggregated product has a finer spatial resolution, which characterizes
    the spatial heterogeneity of SM within the grid. Meanwhile, the disaggregated
    product has completed spatial coverage. Therefore, the disaggregated product effectively
    captures the spatiotemporal characteristics of SM with higher spatial resolution,
    which contributes to local SM management. 4.4.2. Product comparison and validation
    with ground measurements (i) Comparison of products involved in this study A single
    validation metric cannot fully characterize the error of the product, therefore,
    four widely used statistical indicators were employed to validate the SM products
    (Entekhabi et al., 2010): (1) Pearson correlation (R), which reflects the degree
    of correspondence between the products and in-situ data; (2) Bias, which denotes
    that the product is drier or wetter compared to station data; (3) RMSE, the Root
    Mean Square Error, which indicates the degree of error dispersion; and (4) unbiased
    RMSE (ubRMSE), which measures the product’s accuracy by removing the bias from
    the RMSE. Fig. 8 portrays the statistical metrics between each SM product and
    the stations, and Table 3 lists the average statistical indicators for each product.

    which may be influenced by factors including vegetation cover and surface roughness.
    For the ubRMSE, the top-ranked product was the TC-merged product, indicating that
    this study achieves optimal merging. The disaggregated product ranks second because
    the disaggregated product is obtained by disaggregating the TC-merged product,
    which is bound to lose a certain amount of accuracy in the process. The average
    ubRMSE of disaggregated products is 0.044 m3/m3, which essentially satisfies the
    0.04 m3/m3 accuracy criteria set by the Global Climate Observing System for SM
    products. For RMSE, the CCI passive product demonstrates best, with TC-merged
    and disaggregated products following closely behind. Regarding R, the CLDAS product
    exhibits the highest average value (0.782), closely followed by the disaggregated
    product (0.751). The difference between them is minimal, and they all correlate
    strongly with the station data, significantly surpassing other products. In terms
    of Bias, the disaggregated product ranks second with a comparatively low average
    bias value of 0.034 m3/m3. Moreover, all products except the CCI passive product
    overestimated SM values in the Shangdian River Basin, which is in accordance with
    the past study (Zheng et al., 2022). Therefore, considering all indicators comprehensively,
    the disaggregated product inherits the advantages of microwave and model-based
    products, exhibiting satisfactory accuracy. More importantly, it offers higher
    spatiotemporal resolution and coverage. For further comparison of the disaggregated,
    TC-merged, CLDAS, CCI passive, and active SM product, Fig. 9 depicts the temporal
    evolution of these products (dot markers) and site data (line markers) for 2019–2020,
    with a total of 34 in-situ sites in the study area. In this study, one site from
    each of the three networks, large, medium, and small, is selected for demonstration,
    and the sites are L1, M1, and S2. For the site data, the soil was frozen around
    November each year and gradually thawed in March of the following year. During
    this period, SM varied very gently. Throughout the time series, SM varies slightly
    between 0 and 0.03 m3/m3. SM values between the active and passive data are significantly
    different, and they hardly capture the dynamic changes in the site data. In contrast,
    CLDAS, TC-merged, and disaggregated data are well-matched to the stations. In
    addition, all but passive data overestimate SM to some extent, which is consistent
    with the above analysis. (ii) Comparison with other 1 km products Download : Download

    diagrams for CCI passive, CCI active, CLDAS, TC-merged, disaggregated, and station
    data (example for sites L1, M1, and S2). Three publicly available 1 km soil moisture
    products covering the Shandian River Basin were compared. The first is the 1 km
    daily product produced by Fang et al. (2022), which used thermal inertia theory
    and MODIS data to disaggregate 9 km SMAP soil moisture data to 1 km. The second
    is the 1 km daily dataset for all-weather conditions developed by Song et al.
    (2022), which leveraged MODIS and DEM data to disaggregate 36 km AMSR- E/AMSR-2
    product to 1 km. The third is the 1 km seamless soil moisture dataset obtained
    by Zheng et al. (2023), which disaggregated the ESA CCI product using the Random
    Forest algorithm with the help of ERA5 data. Table 4 shows that the 1 km product
    generated in this study has the best ubRMSE, RMSE and R metrics, indicating its
    good performance in the Shandian River Basin. Table 4. Average values of validation

    a disaggregation methodology to combine the strengths of remote sensing and model-based
    products for SM estimation at fine-spatial resolution. The method consists of
    model-based data evaluation, seamless fusion of microwave and model-based SM data
    at 25 km, and SM disaggregation at 1 km with optical/infrared auxiliary variables.
    Based on the developed disaggregation methodology, this study produced three sets
    of valuable products: First, this study evaluates the potential of the triple
    collocation method to merge SM products at 25 km, by integrating the CCI active,
    CCI passive, and CLDAS products. CLDAS was chosen as it has the smallest error
    compared to other model-based products. The TC-merged product fully combines the
    strengths of the model-based and the microwave data, and it has a higher accuracy
    than the individual products, achieving the goal of optimal merging. Second, the
    1 km daily seamless interpolated LST product was developed by exploring spatial
    and spectral similarities between images using iterative multi-temporal interpolation
    and the ESTARFM method. After validation, the mean value of the correlation between
    the interpolated LST and the CLDAS LST was 0.931, indicating its validity and
    reliability. Finally, the 1 km daily seamless SM product was generated, by disaggregating
    25 km TC-merged SM data with the aid of 1 km ancillary data using the GWR algorithm.
    The disaggregated products captured the temporal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity
    across the study area. Given the high spatiotemporal resolution, satisfactory
    accuracy, and spatial continuity, our developed algorithms and SM products have
    significant potential for applications in precision agriculture and hydrology
    domains. In this study, the coverage of CLDAS data is for the Asian region. When
    beyond this region, it necessitates the evaluation of alternative model-based
    products. Therefore, future research endeavors will concentrate on investigating
    the optimal model-based products in various regions, as well as comparing different
    disaggregation methods. CRediT authorship contribution statement Luyao Zhu: Conceptualization,

    is the most produced and utilized natural fiber worldwide. It is not only an important
    raw material for the development of the textile industry but also an oil crop
    and fine chemical raw material. As the largest producer and consumer of cotton
    in the world, China plays an important role in global cotton production, consumption,
    and trade. Cotton is one of the most important cash crops in China, and it is
    directly related to the national economy and people’s livelihood. Additionally,
    cotton cultivation is closely related to irrigation and also has a serious impact
    on total nitrogen emissions during the growing season. Xinjiang is the largest
    cotton producer in China, but it is located in an arid and semiarid region with
    severe water scarcity. Moreover, global warming intensifies and accelerates potential
    evaporation from crop surfaces, so a decline in the availability of soil moisture
    to plants is obvious, and indirectly, the agricultural water demand has increased
    [1]. With the development of society, the increase in water consumption in industries
    and domestically has led to a decrease in the available water for agriculture,
    exacerbates the supply–demand contradiction of agricultural water use, and seriously
    affects the sustainable development of agriculture [2]. In addition, the flowering
    and boll stage is the most highly sensitive period of cotton to water and fertilizer
    demand, and it is also a period of centralized irrigation for cotton. Optimizing
    the irrigation scheduling strategy, managing water resources intensively and efficiently,
    and improving cotton water productivity are urgent challenges to be solved in
    arid and semiarid agriculture regions [3]. Therefore, accurately measuring and
    analyzing the spatial distribution characteristics of early cotton is a basic
    prerequisite of agricultural water management and optimization in Xinjiang in
    order to provide strong support for the adjustment of regional economic structure,
    industrial structure, and water resource scheduling. Traditional information about
    crop planting area, yield, and other data is mainly obtained by on-the-spot sampling
    survey methods, and then those reports are gathered and submitted step-by-step,
    which is not suitable for large-scale surveillance of agriculture information.
    However, such investigations involve a tremendous amount of work, lack quality
    control, and cannot provide spatial distribution information, making it difficult
    to meet the needs of modern management and decision-making. Satellite remote sensing,
    as an advanced detection technique for the recognition of ground objects, can
    obtain real-time information on a large scale from ground objects and has played
    an important role in cotton recognition [4,5]. With the steady development of
    sensor performance, cotton recognition has evolved from lower spatial resolution
    and multispectral remote sensing image data [6,7,8] to high spatial resolution
    and hyperspectral remote sensing imagery [9,10], and its recognition degree and
    accuracy are constantly improving. Moreover, although the recognition and accuracy
    of images obtained by drones equipped with cameras are very high [11], and the
    sampling time can be flexibly controlled, the observation range is smaller than
    satellite remote sensing, the cost of field operations is high, and large-scale
    surveillance of agriculture information requires a long cycle, making it unsuitable
    for early crop recognition. In recent years, experts and scholars have conducted
    extensive research on the extraction of cotton planting areas based on multitemporal
    or multi-source remote sensing image data [12,13]. Although it can achieve good
    recognition results, the recognition process is complex, and early identification
    of cotton remote sensing cannot be completed in time. Moreover, the interference
    of cloud cover and rather long revisiting cycles of high-resolution satellite
    exists, making it difficult to obtain multitemporal remote-sensing data during
    the cotton growth period, which brings many difficulties to the research of cotton
    recognition [14]. At present, various classification methods based on pixels or
    objects have been used for remote-sensing recognition of crops [15], such as the
    maximum likelihood method [16], nearest neighbor sampling method [17], spectral
    angle mapping method [18], decision tree algorithm [19], ear cap transformation
    method [20], support vector machine [21], random forest [22], neural network [23],
    and biomimetic algorithm [24]. For example, Ji Xusheng et al. [25] compared the
    recognition accuracy of different algorithms based on single high-resolution remote
    sensing images from specific time periods: SPOT-6 (May), Pleiades-1 (September),
    and WorldView-3 (October). With the rapid development of remote-sensing information
    deep excavation and information extraction technology, a series of crop classification
    algorithms and studies that do not rely on field sampling have also been carried
    out [26,27,28]. MARIANA et al. [29] used pixel-based and object-based time-weighted
    dynamic time to identify crop planting areas based on sentinel2 images, and this
    type of algorithm is becoming increasingly mature. Deep learning methods have
    been extensively used to extract valuable information due to their ability to
    extract multiple features of remote sensing images and to discover more subtle
    differences, as well as their high training efficiency and classification accuracy
    and the ability to reduce significant spectral differences within similar ground
    objects (such as “same object but different spectra” and “foreign object with
    the same spectrum” phenomena) [30]. Research has shown that convolutional neural
    networks (CNN) have powerful feature learning and expression capabilities [31].
    Zhang Jing et al. [32] used drones to obtain RGB images of six densities of cotton
    fields and expanded the dataset using data augmentation technology. Different
    neural network models (VGGNet16, GoogleNet, MobileNetV2) were used to identify
    and classify cotton fields with different densities, with recognition accuracy
    rates exceeding 90%. However, under the higher-yield-technique mode of mechanized
    farming in Xinjiang, the plant spacing between plants and rows is unified. The
    classification of density does not have practical significance unless there is
    a lack of seedlings due to disasters. The existing high-resolution temporal and
    spatial research projects of cotton recognition and area extraction mostly focus
    on the comprehensive utilization of medium-resolution multitemporal images [33,34].
    There is little research on remote-sensing image recognition of a single period
    or critical period in cotton growth, especially in early cotton based on high-resolution
    remote-sensing images. Moreover, in large-scale cotton operations, the advantages
    of object-oriented analysis and design methods of early recognition in high-resolution
    images are not clear, and further research and exploration are needed. DeepLabV3+
    network is a CNN that can be used for pixel-level object detection. Due to the
    performance in locating objects in images with complex backgrounds, this type
    of method has been widely applied in the field of agriculture [35,36]. In this
    study, an improved DeepLab V3+ network method for cotton high-resolution remote
    sensing recognition has been proposed, termed DAM (double attention mechanism),
    to recognize cotton. By adding a DAM module, it is possible to highlight the important
    parts of channels and spaces in the recognition results, thereby improving the
    precision of the recognition results. Furthermore, the red edge band can effectively
    monitor the growth status of vegetation. GF-6 satellite is the first multispectral
    remote sensing satellite in China to be equipped with a red edge band alone. The
    monitoring capabilities of satellites for resources such as agriculture, forestry,
    and grasslands can be improved. Improving the classification accuracy of paddy
    crops and enhancing crop recognition capabilities by red edge information, purple
    band, and yellow band showed the GF-6 satellite had broad application prospects
    in the precise identification and area extraction of crops. Given the outstanding
    performance on recognition in the field of agriculture by using the DeepLab V3+
    network and GF-6 images recently, we considered applying this improved DeepLabV3+
    network structure on cotton field identification and compare the results with
    other models to see its performance at identifying the cotton field. The purpose
    of this study is to provide a fast and efficient method for the early large-scale
    identification and distribution of cotton, better serving the critical irrigation
    period of cotton in arid and semiarid regions and providing a good decision-making
    basis for water-saving irrigation policies in arid and semiarid regions. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Study Area Shihezi Reclamation Area in Xinjiang (E84°58′–86°24′,
    N43°26′–45°20′) is located in the middle of the northern foot of the Tianshan
    Mountains, in the south of the Junggar Basin and connected to Gurbantunggut Desert
    in the north, with a total area of 5.851 × 109 m3 (Figure 1). The terrain, from
    south to north, is divided into the Tianshan Mountains, piedmont hilly areas,
    piedmont inclined plains, flood alluvial plains, and aeolian desert areas, with
    an average elevation of 450.8 m. The soil is mostly composed of gray desert soil,
    fluvo-aquic soil, and meadow soil. The soil is mainly composed of gravel soil,
    sandy soil, clay soil, etc. Winter is long and cold, and summer is short and hot,
    with an annual average temperature of 7.5–8.2 °C, 2318–2732 h of sunshine, 147–191
    days of frost-free period, 180–270 mm of annual rainfall, and 1000–1500 mm of
    annual evaporation. Atmospheric water resources (water vapor resources and cloud
    water resources) are relatively less compared to other regions in China, and the
    climate is arid, belonging to a typical temperate continental climate. There are
    rivers and springs on the surface, as well as three rivers, including the Manas
    River, Jingou River, and Bayingou River, within the territory. The water source
    of drip irrigation for cotton fields is “groundwater plus canal water”. Figure
    1. The location of the study area and distribution map of field sampling points.
    2.2. Data Sources GF-6 is a low-orbit optical remote-sensing satellite. As China’s
    first precision agriculture high-resolution observation satellite, the high-resolution
    camera (PMS) uses a TDICCD detector that combines panchromatic and blue (450–520
    nm), green (520–600 nm), red (630–690 nm), and near-infrared (760–900 nm) spectra
    with a panchromatic resolution of 2 m and a multispectral resolution of 8 m. Both
    panchromatic and multispectral systems share the same optical system, and interference
    filters are used for spectral analysis. Both push-sweep widths are 95 km, with
    a spectral range of 450–900 nm. The data is downloaded from the China Resources
    Satellite Application Center Network (https://www.cresda.com/zgzywxyyzx/index.html
    (accessed on 20 June 2022, 28 June 2022)). Collect GF-6 satellite PMS image data
    on 20 June 2022 (Jing No. 549536), 20 June (Jing No. 549537), and 28 June (Jing
    No. 552234), covering the entire study area during the cotton flowering period.
    2.3. Data Processing Image preprocessing includes five parts: radiometric calibration,
    atmospheric correction, orthophoto correction, data fusion, and sample labeling.
    Firstly, radiation calibration, atmospheric correction, and orthophoto correction
    are performed on multispectral data, while atmospheric correction is not performed
    on panchromatic data. Secondly, by fusing the preprocessing panchromatic and multispectral
    images, the image resolution can reach up to 2 m. Next, band synthesis is performed,
    and texture features are extracted using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
    Then, select representative desert oasis transition zones, urban areas, plantations,
    and various terrain mixed areas within the image for cotton labeling and generate
    a binary vector layer with ID 2 (cotton) and ID 1 (non-cotton). Finally, convert
    the vector layer into a grid layer and crop it (Figure 2). This study utilizes
    image rotation and image flipping to enhance data and increase samples in the
    training set. Figure 2. Distribution map of visual interpretation samples. 2.4.
    Model and Parameter DeepLabV3+ combines the advantages of the EnCoder-Decoder
    (ED) structure and the Atrus Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. To make the
    model more suitable for identification of cotton, this paper has made the following
    improvements on the basis of DeepLabV3+, changing the backbone network (Xception
    network) to a more lightweight MobileNet V2 network. Secondly, in order to increase
    the sensitivity of the model to the cotton planting area, AM (attention mechanism)
    was added to the ASPP module and upsampling layer. The network architecture diagram
    of the DeepLabV3+ semantic segmentation model based on the attention mechanism
    is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Network architecture diagram of DeepLab V3+ semantic
    segmentation model based on attention mechanism. MobileNet V2 can learn more complex
    features with fewer parameters and lower computational costs compared to traditional
    convolutional networks. Simultaneously, having an inverted residual structure
    helps to increase the network’s representation ability while maintaining its efficiency
    [37]. Visual attention is an inherent mechanism that plays an important role in
    human visual perception. As our visual system has limited capacity and cannot
    efficiently process the information from the entire visual field, we focus our
    attention on specific areas of interest in the image and utilize local observation
    to focus on the prominent parts for detailed analysis of these areas. In recent
    years, many experts and scholars have added attention mechanisms to network models
    to improve recognition performance [38,39]. The DAM is a combination of a spatial
    attention module and a channel attention module. By adding a DAM module, it is
    possible to highlight the important parts of channels and spaces in the recognition
    results, thereby improving the precision of the recognition results [35]. The
    DAM structure diagram is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Schematic diagram of DAM
    structure. The spatial attention module can highlight the spatial position distribution
    that is important for recognition in the convolutional layer. By performing channel
    compression on the input feature map F through global average pooling and global
    maximum pooling, 𝐹 𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑔 and 𝐹 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are obtained respectively. After merging
    two feature maps, the dimensionality is reduced to 1 channel through a 7 × 7 convolution
    operation. Then, the weight map of spatial attention is generated through the
    Sigmoid function, and the generated weight map is multiplied by the original feature
    map (F) to obtain the spatial attention weighted map ( 𝐹 𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑡 ). Its formula is
    as follows: 𝐹 𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑓 7×7 ( 𝐹 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ⊕ 𝐹 𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑔 ))⊗𝐹 (1) In the equation, σ represents
    the sigmoid function, f7 × 7 represents the convolution of 7 × 7, ⊕ represents
    channel merging, and ⊗ represents element multiplication. The channel attention
    module can highlight channels of significant value for recognition in the convolutional
    layer. By compressing the spatial dimensions of the feature map (F) through global
    average pooling and global maximum pooling, 𝐹 𝑠 𝑎𝑣𝑔 and 𝐹 𝑠 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are obtained.
    Then, input Fmaxc and Favgc into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), add the obtained
    results, and input the sigmoid function to generate the weight of the channel
    attention. Multiply the generated weight with the original feature map (F) to
    obtain the channel attention-weighted map ( 𝐹 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 ). Its formula is as follows:
    𝐹 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝜎((𝑀𝐿𝑃( 𝐹 𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥 )+𝑀𝐿𝑃( 𝐹 𝑐 𝑎𝑣𝑔 ))⊗𝐹# (2) In the equation, σ represents
    the sigmoid function, MLP represents the multi-layer perceptron, ⊕ represents
    channel merging, and ⊗ represents element multiplication. 2.5. Feature Set Construction
    2.5.1. Vegetation Index Features The vegetation index has regional and temporal
    characteristics, which are influenced by various factors such as atmospheric conditions,
    surrounding environment, lighting conditions, and vegetation growth. It also varies
    depending on the season or surrounding environment. Due to the values of the Normalized
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) being between [−1,1], it can avoid inconvenience in subsequent
    data calculations and partially mitigate the effects caused by factors such as
    terrain, cloud shadows, solar altitude angle, and satellite observation angle.
    The ratio vegetation index (RVI) has a high correlation with the leaf area index
    and chlorophyll content and can be used to distinguish different crops. The difference
    vegetation index (DVI), also known as the environmental vegetation index, is extremely
    sensitive to changes in the environment. Therefore, attempts were made to identify
    cotton using NDVI, RVI, and DVI (Table 1). Table 1. Vegetation index based on
    image band operation. 2.5.2. Texture Features Texture feature is an inherent feature
    of an image, which reflects the properties and spatial relationships of the grayscale
    of the image. It accurately reflects the real structure of ground objects through
    the frequency of color tone changes in the image. The presence of differences
    in canopy structure among different crops is an important classification feature
    for crop recognition [40]. Based on the fused 4-band data of GF-6 PMS, the principle
    of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) proposed by Haralick is introduced to
    extract texture features. The eight texture feature parameters include entropy
    (ENT), mean (MEA), variance (VAR), contrast (CON), homogeneity (HOM), second moment
    (ASM), correlation (COR), and dissimilarity (DIS) [41]. In calculation, the parameters
    involved are the window size, direction, step length, etc. 2.5.3. Feature Combination
    In order to compare the recognition accuracy of different models and the recognition
    accuracy using only the 4-band features and full features under the DeepLabV3+
    network attention mechanism model, the following experiments were conducted, and
    their recognition accuracy was compared (Table 2). Table 2. Model and feature
    set combination. 2.6. Model Performance Evaluation Indicators The semantic segmentation
    performance evaluation indicators can be used to compare the recognition results.
    There are many indicators commonly used to evaluate the performance of model training
    processes, such as Pixel Accuracy (PA), Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), Precision,
    Recall, F1_Score, Intersection over Union, IoU, etc. This paper uses MIoU and
    cross-entropy loss function as evaluation indicators. IoU is used to evaluate
    the overlap between each class and the real label in the semantically segmented
    image. The confusion matrix (CM) of identification results is shown in Table 3.
    The calculation formula is 𝐼𝑜𝑈=𝑇𝑃/(𝐹𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑃) (6) Table 3. Identification result
    confusion matrix. TP and TN with predicted values consistent with actual values;
    FP, FN with inconsistent predicted and true values. MIoU calculates the mean of
    all classes of IoU using the following formula: 𝑀𝐼𝑜𝑈= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑖𝐼𝑜𝑈 (7) Binary
    cross entropy is a loss function commonly used in machine learning modules to
    evaluate the quality of a binary classification prediction result. Its formula
    is 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠=− 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑦 𝑖 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑝( 𝑦 𝑖 ))+(1− 𝑦 𝑖 ) 𝑙𝑜𝑔(1−𝑝( 𝑦 𝑖 )) (8) where y
    is the binary label 0 or 1, and 𝑝(𝑦) is the probability that the output belongs
    to the y label. For the case where label y is 1, if the predicted value 𝑝(𝑦) approaches
    1, then the value of the loss function approaches 0. On the contrary, its value
    is very large, which is very consistent with the properties of the log function.
    2.7. Model Parameter Settings The parameters of the DeepLabV3+ network attention
    mechanism model used in this paper are shown in Table 4: Table 4. Model configuration
    parameters. Batch size represents the data volume input into GPU graphics memory
    each time. Epoch represents the number of iterations after a complete traversal
    during deep learning model training. Through continuous attempts, the model achieves
    satisfactory results when Epoch is 100 in this paper. The Adam optimizer function
    is used as the parameter optimizer. Using a dynamically decaying learning rate
    and the StepLR function provided in the PyTorch model, the initial learning rate
    is set to 0.01, step size is set to 10, and gamma is set to 0.1. This indicates
    that the learning rate decreases to 0.1 times the original after every 10 iterations
    (Figure 5). In this paper, horizontal and vertical flipping were used to increase
    the sample size. After the data preprocessing is completed, the vectorized sample
    data is made into label data in the study area, and it is randomly divided into
    training samples and validation samples in a 7:3 ratio. This study used this label
    data to evaluate the performance of deep learning models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, DeepLabV3+
    DAM with 4-band, and DeepLabV3+DAM with full features). Figure 5. Loss changes
    corresponding to Epoch settings in different models. 2.8. Model Accuracy Evaluation
    Indicators This paper verifies the accuracy through on-site observation data and
    selects 98 non-cotton sample points and 185 cotton sample points in the study
    area. Calculate the CM using omission error and commission error, then derive
    the consistency of the kappa coefficient and overall accuracy between the classification
    map and the reference data. Calculate classification accuracy statistical data
    based on the error matrix, including overall accuracy (correct classification
    number/total number of measured samples), producer’s accuracy (correct classification
    number/total number of a certain category), user’s accuracy (correct classification
    number/(correct classification number plus total number of misclassified to a
    certain category)), and kappa coefficient. This study used this on-site observation
    data to evaluate the accuracy of all models. The Kappa coefficient is an indicator
    for comprehensive evaluation of classification accuracy, which can determine the
    consistency of classification [42]. Its formula is 𝐾𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑎= (𝑃 𝑜 − 𝑃 𝑒 )/(1− 𝑃 𝑒
    )  (9) where Po is the sum of the correct pixel count for cotton and non-cotton
    classification divided by the total number of pixels. Assuming that the true pixel
    count for each class is {x1, x2}, the predicted pixel count for each class is
    {y1, y2}, and the total number of pixels in the sample is n, Pe is calculated
    as follows: 𝑃 𝑒 = 𝑥 1 𝑦 1 + 𝑥 2 𝑦 2 𝑛 2   (10) 3. Results and Analysis 3.1. Performance
    Evaluation In view of the excellent performance of the DeepLabV3+ network model
    in image recognition, we consider applying this improved DeepLabV3+ network attention
    mechanism model structure to cotton field recognition and comparing its performance
    with other models to see its performance in early cotton recognition to see its
    performance in the early identification of cotton. Considering the training efficiency
    and cotton recognition accuracy, this paper also compares the attention mechanism
    model of the DeepLabV3+ network using only 4-band. MIoU can be used to judge the
    accuracy of the model’s prediction results and labeled as similar, and the speed
    of the model’s operation can also be determined based on the calculation speed.
    It is a relatively balanced indicator for measuring model performance. By comparing
    the training sets in the dataset (Table 5), it is found that the DeepLabV3+ network
    attention mechanism model with full features has the highest MIoU and the minimum
    binary cross entropy loss function. Through comparing the MIoU and the binary
    cross entropy loss function, we can find that although the DeepLabV3+DAM with
    full features performs the best regarding MIoU and loss, these optimal values
    show a very small absolute difference between these key performance indicators.
    Table 5. The optimal value for each model configuration parameter. 3.2. Accuracy
    Evaluation CM is the most important index in the accuracy evaluation of ground
    object recognition. The omission error and commission error can be expressed by
    producer precision and user precision, respectively. Therefore, overall accuracy,
    producer accuracy, user accuracy, and Kappa coefficient are used to compare the
    accuracy of different model algorithms’ recognition results (Table 5). It was
    found that in the model using full feature information for classification, the
    overall accuracy of the DeepLabV3+ network was 96.11%, while the overall accuracy
    of the model incorporating the attention mechanism was 98.23%, an improvement
    of 2%. The Kappa coefficient also increased from 0.914 to 0.961, an increase of
    0.047. However, the overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficients of
    the 4-band DeepLabV3+ network with attention mechanism are less different from
    those of the DeepLabV3+ network with all feature sets, and the recognition accuracy
    of the five comparisons reaches an excellent level except RF (0.8 ≤ Kappa ≤1)
    [43]. From Table 6, the DeepLabV3+ DAM with all feature sets shows that the producer’s
    accuracy of cotton is 98.38%, while the user’s accuracy of cotton is 98.91%. This
    indicates that 98.38% of the cotton area on the ground is correctly identified
    as cotton, while 98.91% of the estimated cotton area on the classification map
    is actually cotton. In other words, the classification map missed 1.62% of the
    cotton area on the ground (omission error), while approximately 1.09% of the pixels
    classified as cotton on the classification map (commission error) actually belong
    to other categories. Among the 185 measured points that were actually cotton,
    3 points were misclassified as non-cotton. In addition, out of the 184 points
    classified as cotton on the classification map, 2 are actually corn. Indirectly,
    the actual cotton area is underestimated on the classification chart, but not
    much, only 0.53%. Among the evaluation indicators of P_A, U_A, Overall accuracy,
    Kappa, MIoU, and Loss, the performance and accuracy indicators of the DeepLabV3+DAM
    with full features perform best. Therefore, the DeepLabV3+DAM with full features
    can be concluded to have the best performance and accuracy for the cotton early
    identification task in our study when considering the general probability. Table
    6. Accuracy evaluation of five kinds of comparison research. 3.3. Cotton Identification
    Based on GF-6 satellite images, cotton is identified by comprehensive use of spectrum,
    its combination information, and texture information. We compare its performance
    and accuracy for the cotton early identification task with the RF, U-Net, DeepLabV3+
    network, and Deeplabv3+ model based on the attention mechanism with 4-band. According
    to the above description, applying the DeepLabV3+DAM model proposed in this article
    to remote sensing recognition of cotton can achieve higher recognition accuracy
    and extraction effect. Therefore, we visualize the detailed features of five sub-images,
    the corresponding ground truths, and the prediction results of different models
    from the validation dataset. These five areas include representative desert oasis
    transition zones, urban areas, plantation areas, and various terrain mixed areas.
    Considering the training efficiency and cotton identification accuracy, we selected
    a portion of the representative desert oasis transition zones in the GF-6 images
    to exhibit each model’s performance. The recognition results are shown in Figure
    6. We can see that the DeepLabV3+DAM with full features predictions (Figure 6C)
    are the most consistent with the original image (Figure 6A) and visual interpretation
    samples (Figure 6B), while the RF predictions (Figure 6G) are relatively rough.
    From the visual interpretation, the accuracy of DeepLabV3+DAM with full features
    is better than the other models on the discrimination between cotton and non-cotton
    fields, without excessive confusion and misjudgment in desert oasis transition
    zones, and other models have excessive confusion and misjudgment in the red solid
    line depicts area. In addition, except for the RF model, the boundaries of the
    cotton fields in other models are relatively clear in desert oasis transition
    zones, indicating that deep learning is superior to machine learning in this recognition
    experiment. This is because by modifying the input layer and adding an upsampling
    layer, the phenomenon of loss of ground object boundary information is improved,
    and the recognition accuracy of cotton is improved. Figure 6. Comparison of the
    cotton identification effect of different models in some areas. (A) GF-6 remote
    sensing images, (B) visual interpretation samples, (C) the DeepLabV3+DAM with
    full features, (D) the DeepLabV3+ Network, (E) the DeepLabV3+ DAM with 4-band,
    (F) the U-Net model, (G) the RF model. The white color indicates the identified
    non-cotton in the Figures (B) to (G), and the red solid line depicts area with
    differences in the Figure (A). Considering the training efficiency and cotton
    identification accuracy, we selected another portion of the representative urban
    area in the GF-6 images to exhibit each model’s performance. By comparing their
    performance and accuracy for the cotton early identification model of the RF,
    U-Net, DeepLabV3+ network, and Deeplabv3+ DAM with 4-band, the recognition results
    are shown in Figure 7. We can see that the prediction results of all the deep
    learning methods (Figure 7C) are similar to the original image (Figure 7A) and
    visual interpretation samples (Figure 7B), while the RF predictions (Figure 7G)
    are relatively rough. From the visual interpretation, the accuracy of DeepLabV3+DAM
    with full features is better than the other models on the discrimination between
    cotton and non-cotton fields. There are only a few instances of excessive confusion
    and misjudgment in the representative urban area, and other models have more excessive
    confusion and misjudgment than DeepLabV3+DAM with full features model in the red
    solid line depicts area. In addition, except for the RF model, the boundaries
    of the cotton fields in other models are also relatively clear in the representative
    urban area, indicating that deep learning is superior to machine learning in this
    recognition experiment. It has been determined to be the best model for early
    cotton recognition in view of the excellent performance of the DeepLabV3+DAM model
    with full features in previous experiments. In this research, under the premise
    of limited training samples, the DeepLab V3+ ADM model still achieved good results
    for early cotton recognition and can provide a decision-making basis for water-saving
    irrigation in this area. Figure 7. Comparison of the cotton identification effect

    The white color indicates the identified non-cotton in the Figures (B) to (G),
    and the red solid line depicts areas with differences in the Figure (A). 4. Conclusions
    and Discussion 4.1. Conclusions In this paper, the improved DeepLabV3+DAM model
    structure—which was used for the field of agriculture previously [35,36] to identify
    cotton fields using GF-6 satellite image data—is shown. This model can introduce
    the DAM module, which is a combination of the spatial attention module and channel
    attention module. The spatial attention module can highlight the spatial position
    distribution that is important for recognition in the convolutional layer. The
    channel attention module can highlight channels of significant value for recognition
    in the convolutional layer. By modifying the input layer and adding an upsampling
    layer, the phenomenon of loss of ground object boundary information is improved,
    and the recognition accuracy of cotton is improved. Based on this advantage, the
    model can fully use spectral combination information and texture information for
    cotton field identification before and after the flowering period of cotton. These
    experiment results have been validated using ground truths and compared with four
    deep learning models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, DeepLabV3+ DAM with 4-band, DeepLabV3+
    DAM with full features) and a machine learning model (RF). Through experiments,
    it can be found that the recognition results are affected by many factors, such
    as reflection spectrum, ground texture information, and model algorithm. The main
    conclusions are as follows: According to the experimental results, the improved
    DenseNet model is superior to these popular CNNs using the same datasets. (1)
    The recognition accuracy of traditional machine learning algorithms is far inferior
    to that of deep learning algorithms in accuracy evaluation and the phenomenon
    of loss of ground object boundary information. (2) Compared with the DeepLab V3+
    network and U-Net, the DeepLabV3+ DAM model with the full feature showed a good
    effect on early cotton recognition in this study area. (3) Only the spectral information
    provided by the 4-band feature set is relatively limited, and the performance
    and recognition accuracy of the same DeepLabV3+ DAM model is worse than that of
    the full feature set. 4.2. Discussion In this research, from the perspective of
    water conservation and regulation, high-resolution images of the cotton flowering
    period were obtained. The conclusion that previous studies from the perspective
    of yield estimation have found that the highest cotton recognition accuracy in
    this region occurs during the boll opening period (August, September) [8,44] is
    not contradictory. The low coverage rate of cotton in the flowering stage and
    the unified mechanical cultivation mode of cotton in Xinjiang provided the basis
    for the selection of the texture feature sets and laid the foundation for improving
    the accuracy of early cotton remote-sensing recognition and reduce the difficulty
    of recognition. However, it should be noted that if there are other crops using
    wide film drip irrigation in the study area during the same period, it is likely
    to cause confusion in the recognition results, such as the only two misclassifications
    in the DeepLab V3+ DAM model being corn. A future task will be to verify the improved
    DeepLab V3+ DAM model on images with higher temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions
    for cotton field identification. Early recognition based on drone cotton has been
    used by many scholars for pest control due to its high spatial resolution and
    free time control [45,46]. However, it is time-consuming and expensive, and flight
    time and area are strictly controlled. In addition, the later image stitching
    method will also affect recognition accuracy, which is slightly less economical
    and practical compared to high-resolution remote sensing image recognition. The
    second future task is to apply this method in other areas with complex planting
    structures and diversified agricultural management practices. Xun et al. [5] explored
    the feasibility of combining time series enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated
    from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data with
    the fused representation-based classification (FRC) algorithm to identify the
    cotton pixels and map cotton cultivated area in the major cotton production regions
    of China. They believe that the accuracy of the model is influenced not only by
    longitude and latitude but also by agricultural management practices (such as
    species and sowing dates) and climate change. Compared with using only 4-band
    satellite images based on remote-sensing image (GF-1, WFV) data to identify cotton
    during the boll opening period [47], it is believed that the optimized model of
    DenseNet can fully utilize spatial and spectral information for cotton field recognition.
    By comparing the training efficiency and performance of four widely used classical
    convolutional neural networks (ResNet, VGG, SegNet, and DeepLab v3+), it was also
    found that the DeepLab V3+ network has the shortest training time, the easiest
    training, and the lowest computational cost. So, the third future task is to reduce
    the labor cost, improve the automation level and working efficiency of the model,
    and improve the stability and generalization of the model. Author Contributions

- analysis: 'The paper, titled "Development and evaluation of a decision support mobile
    application for cotton irrigation management," introduces idCROP, a mobile irrigation
    decision support app designed to increase water-use efficiency for cotton producers
    in the Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions. idCROP combines the DSSAT
    crop simulation model, a newly developed economic model, and real-time data from
    users to provide efficient and situationally relevant irrigation schedules. It
    predicts irrigation timing and amount, crop yield, and economic outcomes based
    on water use and production goals. The mobile app is user-friendly, cost-effective,
    requires minimal input data, and supports economic analysis. The idCROP app was
    validated at the Texas A&M AgriLife Chillicothe Research Station and produced
    acceptable results in predicting irrigation schedules and economic outcomes. While
    the app can be used without sensors, it also supports the integration of remote
    plant water stress detection sensors mounted on pivot irrigation systems. The
    primary limitations of idCROP are: the prototype is currently only applicable
    to cotton production in the Texas Rolling Plains region (though the authors state
    that additional crops and locations can be added), the weather forecast has significant
    uncertainties, and the continuous availability of real-time and short-term forecasted
    weather data could be challenging. Overall, this paper provides a thorough evaluation
    of idCROP, highlighting its potential to improve irrigation water-use efficiency
    and crop yields for cotton producers in the target regions.'

    yield and economic returns. This enables users to choose an irrigation strategy
    that best suits their irrigation capacities and expected returns. The irrigation
    schedules can be improved by optional remote detection of plant water stress using
    a sensor platform mounted on a pivot irrigation system, but the app can be used
    without the sensors in conjunction with any type of irrigation system. The crop

    schedulingPlant stress sensors 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the largest
    water consumer, accounting for ∼70% of global freshwater withdrawal and ∼90% of
    freshwater consumption [1]. Irrigation allows crop production in water-limited
    environments and therefore plays a vital role in global agricultural production
    [2]. Nevertheless, increasing incidences of weather extremes and uncertainty in
    irrigation water supply are critical challenges faced by many producers worldwide
    [[2], [3],]. For example, the infamous drought of 2011 in Texas, United States,
    resulted in about $7.6 billion in agricultural losses [4]. Some heavily irrigated
    regions like western and south-central United States, northern China, western
    and central Asia, North Africa, and Mexico are projected to have no irrigation
    potential in the future due to insufficient water supply in a warming climate
    [5]. Moreover, warmer and drier summers are expected in many regions in the world,
    which will exacerbate the situation by increasing crop water requirements [6,7].
    Therefore, information technology-based irrigation decision support tools are
    needed in these regions to apply limited irrigation water more efficiently. Currently
    available irrigation decision support tools can be classified into four types:
    evapotranspiration (ET) and soil water balance (WB)-based, soil sensor-based,
    plant sensor-based, and crop model-based. However, most of these irrigation decision
    support tools have generally remained limited to the scientific community, with
    low adoption by producers. Issues that limit their adoption include the high cost
    of hardware and software, need to have technical background to use the tools,
    requirement of extensive input data, low accuracy, as well as lack of efficient
    economic analysis support [8]. The ET-WB-based irrigation scheduling method has
    wide applications in web-based or smartphone apps due to its simplicity and requirement
    for little input data. For example, the WISE (Water Irrigation Scheduler for Efficient
    Application) web-based app developed at Colorado State University  [9,10] can
    schedule irrigation on any individual farm across the state of Colorado with automated
    access to daily weather data from a network of more than 90 weather stations and
    soil profile data from the SSURGO database (http://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/).
    The SmartIrrigation smartphone app developed at the University of Florida provides
    real-time irrigation schedules for different crops using weather data from 42
    sites and forecasted short-term data from the National Weather Service [11]. However,
    the ET-WB-based methods have low accuracy in predicting irrigation timing and
    amount due to the lack of field data, such as information about soil properties
    and on-site weather [12]. Soil sensor-based irrigation scheduling requires the
    installation of sensors and extensive manual data collection and therefore is
    cumbersome and expensive. In addition, soil moisture sensors are static and cannot
    represent the spatial variability in soil moisture across a field. DIEM, Dashboard
    for Irrigation Efficiency and Management [13], is a web-based tool developed in
    Texas for field-specific irrigation scheduling that uses soil moisture data collected
    from static sensors and estimates weather data until the end of the growing season
    based on historical data. DIEM requires the installation and removal of soil moisture
    sensors in the field annually. The use of smart sensors in recent years has facilitated
    the monitoring of spatial variability in soil moisture. Some of the examples of
    these sensors include the automated irrigation system developed by Gutierrez et
    al. [14] and several commercially available irrigation management systems [15,16].
    However, the soil sensor-based irrigation scheduling tools cannot accurately represent
    crop water stress, especially under cloudy and high humidity conditions [12].
    For example, crops may not suffer severe water stress even with a low soil water
    content because of reduced evaporative demand under cloudy and high humidity conditions.
    Alternatively, plant sensor-based methods directly estimate crop water status
    by integrating soil-water environment and, therefore, can effectively determine
    irrigation timing [17]. One popular plant sensor-based method is the Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI), which uses the canopy-to-air temperature difference to quantify
    crop water stress. The theoretical CWSI derived following the energy balance equation
    has been successfully used to indicate crop water status and schedule irrigation
    under different climatic conditions [[18], [19], [20]]. However, direct use of
    CWSI before full canopy closure can incur substantial errors due to the influence
    of soil heat flux. To overcome this weakness, Moran et al. [21] developed water
    deficit index (WDI), a modification of CWSI, in which the impact of soil heat
    flux was considered using a linear mixing model of soil and canopy temperatures.
    The WDI method was tested in high-frequency sprinkler irrigation for cotton [22].
    Although plant sensor-based methods can effectively determine when to irrigate,
    the amount of water to be applied cannot be directly obtained. Hence, these are
    usually integrated with other methods for real-time irrigation scheduling. With
    proper parameterization and calibration, crop simulation models can be used for
    irrigation scheduling by integrating soil properties, climate, crop genetics,
    and farming system management practices. Crop models are also helpful in evaluating
    the impacts of deficit irrigation scheduling strategies on crop yield. Several
    crop models have been successfully applied for irrigation scheduling, including
    the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) [23,24], AquaCrop
    [25], CROPWAT [26], and Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) [27,28]. These
    models vary in their complexity and accuracy. For example, AquaCROP uses a simplified
    crop model with few data requirements [[29], [30], [31]], but it underestimates
    soil moisture status, leading to inaccurate irrigation scheduling [32]. Among
    these models, the DSSAT model performs better in deficit irrigation scheduling,
    as demonstrated in a variety of regions [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39],
    [40], [41]]. Considerable progress has been made to improve the irrigation scheduling
    algorithm in DSSAT. For example, DeJonge and Thorp [42] improved crop ET simulation
    in DSSAT by including the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient and ASCE standardized reference
    evapotranspiration methods. Lopez et al. [43] integrated growth stage-based deficit
    irrigation, allowing users to specify different thresholds to trigger irrigation
    during different growth stages in DSSAT. The effectiveness of crop model-based
    irrigation scheduling depends on model accuracy, calibration quality, and weather
    forecast reliability [12]. Crop models have been widely used in the retrospective
    evaluation of irrigation scheduling management using historical weather data,
    but the use of crop model-based real-time irrigation scheduling is still limited
    primarily due to unreliable weather forecasts. Using the RZWQM2 model equipped
    with DSSAT, Gu et al. [44] developed IrrSch to schedule irrigation based on model
    simulated crop water stress. IrrSch is currently being tested for real-time irrigation
    scheduling for cotton in Xinjiang, China [36]. The Food, Agriculture and Resource
    Management System (FARMs) developed by Kim and Kisekka [45] enables web-based
    DSSAT simulation for near-real-time simulation by linking the grid SSURGO soil

    Nevertheless, future weather forecasts in these two real-time irrigation tools
    were produced using historical weather statistics (e.g., mean and variance), leading
    to considerable uncertainties in full-season decision support. In addition, very
    few crop model-based irrigation scheduling tools have attempted to incorporate
    economic models to support cost-benefit analysis at the farm level [8]. To address
    these drawbacks, we aimed to develop an easy-to-use mobile app for a crop model-
    and sensor-based irrigation decision support system, called idCROP (irrigation
    decision support system for Conserving Resources and Optimizing Production). Cotton  (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) was selected as the focus crop to verify the reliability of the app.
    The Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions, which collectively produce about
    26% of U.S. cotton [46], were selected as the study regions for app development.
    Cotton production in these regions highly depends on irrigation water from the
    underlying Seymour and Ogallala Aquifers. These aquifers have experienced substantial
    groundwater declines due to intensive irrigation and droughts [47]. On the other
    hand, climate change could lead to warmer and drier summers over these two regions
    in the future [48,49], which will necessitate larger groundwater withdrawals to
    meet the higher ET demands. To reduce groundwater use and prolong the usable economic
    lifetime of the Ogallala Aquifer, Groundwater Conservation Districts in the Texas
    High Plains region have already enacted restrictions on groundwater pumping [50].
    Therefore, adoption of innovative irrigation management tools is essential for
    cotton producers in these regions to efficiently apply limited irrigation water
    to maximize crop water productivity, helping producers comply with groundwater
    pumping restrictions. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop the framework
    and workflow of idCROP; (2) prepare region-specific input files, including soil
    files, cultivar parameters, and automated weather files throughout the growing
    season; (3) update and extend the economic analysis functionality; and (4) validate
    the crop-based irrigation decision support system using the field data obtained
    in the 2020 and 2021 cotton growing season at Texas A&M AgriLife Chillicothe Research
    Station in the Texas Rolling Plains region. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Crop
    model- and sensor-based irrigation decision support system The overall architecture
    of idCROP with major components and data streams is illustrated in Fig. 1. The
    two main components of the idCROP tool are a mobile application, developed for
    iOS and Android, and a server. The main software used on the server is DSSAT,
    which integrates with a newly developed economic model. The app was developed
    using an Agile-based software engineering methodology, which involves rapid, iterative,
    and feedback-focused software generation. Using this method, we obtained a finished
    product that addresses the feedback from end-users and subject-matter experts
    during the app development process. This process enabled iterative refinement
    and app expansion and provided an expanded set of features and capabilities in
    an incremental fashion. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Layout of crop model- and sensor-based irrigation decision
    support system and illustration of workflow. The dashed line indicates that the
    sensor-based system is an optional setting. The mobile app can be used without
    the installation of in-field sensors. There are three major components of idCROP:
    (1) data input from users, (2) scenario creation and execution, and (3) result
    generation and presentation. User inputs include initial conditions, planting
    details, management practices, harvest details, and expenses/income, as detailed
    in Table 1. For scenario creation and execution, a data manager is used to create
    input files required to execute the DSSAT and economic models. It combines three
    data sources, including data from users, data stored in the database (e.g., environmental
    and economic data), and external data from the internet (i.e., real-time weather
    data). As shown in Fig. 1, if sensors are installed, a datalogging controller
    is used to store and upload data from the field to the server. Result generation
    and presentation include irrigation schedules, seasonal irrigation requirement,
    water use efficiency, and expected yield and net return. Table 1. Input types

    For the data input using the imperial system, idCROP will convert to the metric
    system. ⁎ More details about these parameters are provided in Supplementary Table
    S1. Users can create scenarios based on the unique characteristics of their fields
    and growing practices. The app analyzes different scenarios and compares how different
    irrigation schedules affect the simulated yield and net return. There are two
    options for irrigation scheduling. The default option is based on the DSSAT model,
    with irrigation scheduled by model-simulated soil water balance. This crop model-based
    approach can be used with any irrigation system. Users have an option to improve
    irrigation prescriptions with the installation of in-field sensors (Fig. 1). For
    this optional integrated (i.e., crop model- and sensor-based) approach, a sensor
    platform is mounted on the pivot, allowing real-time measurement of canopy temperature
    and ground coverage. These data are transferred to a server using a datalogger
    and a wireless modem (Fig. 1) to calculate the hourly WDI. The field-calibrated
    relationships between the seasonal average WDI and cotton yield under different
    ET replacements are used to determine the WDI threshold to trigger irrigation.
    The use of WDI provides on-site corrections and improves the accuracy of the model-based
    irrigation schedules. It is also recommended to install a mini weather station
    into the sensor system, which was tested to be highly effective. For users who
    do not have a mini weather station, idCROP automatically acquires real-time weather
    data from publicly available data, which is explained in detail in Section 2.5.
    The idCROP tool currently calculates expected yield following DSSAT-simulated
    seasonal irrigation schedules under four default irrigation strategies––0, 30,
    60, and 90% ET-replacement. However, the tool is customizable to other ET-replacement
    values and our future efforts will focus on this. For each strategy, the system
    applies the economic model to estimate farm profits expected from adhering to
    the simulated irrigation schedule. Users can follow any ET replacement strategy
    to apply deficit irrigation depending on irrigation water availability. With this
    information, users can proactively make decisions about in-season irrigation and
    crop management to optimize crop yield and profit. The resulting irrigation prescriptions
    are updated as the growing season progresses based on recorded irrigations, past
    and real-time weather data from the beginning of the growing season, and updated
    short-term weather for the remainder of the growing season. Users can change their
    irrigation strategy during the growing season, if necessary, based on unanticipated
    changes in the availability of irrigation water, the weather, or their yield and
    economic goals. 2.2. Field experiment and treatments The parameters used in the
    DSSAT model and the WDI threshold used to trigger irrigation under different ET
    replacements were calibrated and validated using field experiments. A two-year
    study was conducted at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Station at Chillicothe
    in the Texas Rolling Plains in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons (Fig. 2a). A
    two-tower center pivot irrigation system was used (Fig. 2b). Half of the field
    was covered by the pivot, which was divided into sections, with each occupying
    1/12th of the total area. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete
    block design, with three replications of four irrigation scheduling treatments
    that differed in ET replacement rate (90%, 60%, 30%, and 0%). Download : Download

    radiometer and spectral sensor; and (d) CR1000X datalogging controller. (c) and
    (d) are the equipment required if the user chooses to adopt the sensor-based approach.
    A sensor platform was mounted on the pivot, about 4 m above the ground (Fig. 2c).
    The sensor platform included an SI-121-SS infrared radiometer [51] to measure
    crop canopy temperature and an S2-112-SS spectral sensor pair [51] to measure
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In 2021, a ClimaVUE50 all-in-one
    weather station [52] was added to the sensor platform, allowing for on-site collection
    of weather parameters. The sensor platform was controlled by a CR1000X datalogging
    controller [53] to store and upload data to the server (Fig. 2d). Data were collected
    within two hours of solar noon every two weeks on dry runs (i.e., irrigation water
    was not being applied) of the pivot across the field experiment area. A similar
    sensor system was placed on the ground in the 90% ET replacement plot, including
    an all-in-one weather station and an infrared temperature (IRT) sensor. The ground-based
    system allowed for continuous hourly measurement, which is used to validate the
    pivot-based system. A mid-maturing cotton cultivar (Phytogen 350 W3FE) was planted
    on 15 June 2020 and 27 May 2021. Irrigation was applied weekly or twice-weekly,
    depending on ET water losses. Monitoring and calculation of reference ET was done
    using data from an on-site weather station. The irrigation amount for each ET
    replacement treatment was calculated based on weekly reference ET using the Penman-Monteith
    method, which was multiplied by the appropriate growth stage-based irrigation
    coefficients for cotton from Ko et al. [54] and ET replacement coefficient (e.g.,
    0.6 for 60% ET replacement). At the end of each growing season, plots were harvested
    to determine cotton lint and seed yields. Seed cotton yield (seed + lint) was
    used for model simulations. 2.3. Scenario and data 2.3.1. Initial conditions After
    specifying the field location (latitude, longitude), users are required to select
    the crop grown in the previous growing season. Based on users’ choice, idCROP
    calculates the root and surface residue weight remaining in the field, which are
    the input data required by DSSAT to initialize the fresh organic matter of the
    experiment file. The idCROP app provides input files for 15 crop types, including
    fallow and ‘other crops’. For crop types that are not listed, users can select
    ‘other crops’, which is calculated based on the mean value of major crops. The
    major crop types in the study region were identified from the Cropland Data Layer
    of the National Agriculture Statistics Service, United States Department of Agriculture
    (https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) (Supplementary Table S2 and Figure S2).
    The surface residue at harvest is calculated as: (1) (2) where Sur_residuei is
    the surface residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of the ith type of crop at the harvest;
    Yieldi and Sur_mi are the yield (kg [dry matter] ha−1) and above-ground biomass
    (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of ith type of crop at maturity, respectively; and HIi
    is the harvest index of ith type of crop, which is explained in detail in Table
    S3. The root residue at harvest is calculated as: (3) where Root_residuei is the
    root residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of the ith type of crop at the harvest, and
    RSratio is the root-to-shoot ratio, for which a constant value of 0.4 is used.
    The decomposition of surface and root residues is analyzed using a first-order
    exponential model [55] as: (4) where Residuet and Residue0 are the surface or
    root residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) at time t and the harvest, respectively; and
    k is the decomposition rate of surface or root residue and are assumed to be the
    same. Fig. 3 shows the percentages of surface/root residue remaining at different
    times. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download full-size

    alfalfa from Schomberg and Steiner [57]; peanut from Mulvaney et al. [58]; millet
    from Soratto et al. [59]; and Barley from Loomis et al. [60]. Triticale uses the
    value of winter wheat, and hay and grass use the value of alfalfa. 2.3.2. Planting
    details Some screenshots of idCROP are provided in Fig. 4 to illustrate its capabilities.
    To ensure robust crop growth and production simulation, the app sets a soft warning
    if the entered planting date is outside the dates specified by the crop insurance
    window (April 15 - June 20) and a hard warning if the entered date is 2-4 weeks
    beyond the dates specified by the crop insurance window (April 1- July 5). The
    emergence date is calculated based on an accumulation of 70 daily heat units after
    planting with a temperature threshold of 60 ℉ (15.6 °C) (i.e., DD60) (Eq. S1 in
    Supplementary Material). Row spacing and seed rate data are required from users
    to calculate plant population at seeding (Eq. S2). The idCROP tool automatically
    calculates the population at emergence based on an 82% emergence rate [61] using
    Eq. S3, but advanced users can set the emergence rate by themselves. A simple
    procedure to estimate this parameter is provided if users click the ‘show advanced’
    button (Fig. 4c-d). Download : Download high-res image (788KB) Download : Download

    For irrigation setup, idCROP provides three options, including low energy precision
    application (LEPA), low elevation spray application (LESA), and mid-elevation
    spray application (MESA). The irrigation efficiency of each system was estimated
    as the mean value of efficiencies reported in published studies (Table S3). 2.3.3.
    Management practices After setting the initial conditions and planting details,
    users can define management practices, including irrigation, tillage, fertilizer,
    and chemicals application dates and amounts. The available options for each management
    practice are detailed in Table S1. The data on tillage depth for each application
    method is taken from Neitsch et al. [62] (Table S5). The details about the method
    and depth of fertilizer and chemical application are included in Table S6. 2.4.
    Environmental data 2.4.1. Soil files To provide field-scale soil input data, the
    Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data and the NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were
    used to identify dominant soil types in cotton acreages in the Texas Rolling Plains
    region. The dominant soil types are detailed in Table S7. Soil properties such
    as soil texture, bulk density, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil pH, and
    cation exchange capacity for the identified soils were obtained from the Official
    Soil Series Descriptions [63]. Other soil information such as the field capacity
    (referred to as drained upper limit in DSSAT), wilting point (lower limit), soil
    water at saturation, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated using
    the Soil-Plant-Air-Water model [64]. Soil root growth factor, an important input
    for each soil layer that reflects physical or chemical constraints on root growth
    in certain soil layers [65], was estimated using a function in the DSSAT soil
    file creation utility program (i.e., SBuild) based on soil texture, bulk density
    and soil organic carbon [66]. The initial soil moisture was assumed to be 65%
    of the available water content. The developed soil files were included in idCROP
    so that user can select a soil type that is similar in soil properties to the
    soil on user''s farm. 2.4.2. Cultivar parameter files The crop modules in the
    DSSAT-CSM require genotype coefficients for different maturity groups to mimic
    their growth and development. Cotton genotype coefficients were developed for
    three maturity groups (i.e., early, early-mid, and mid-full) using variety trial
    data of 45 cultivars from 10 stations collected by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension
    over five growing seasons (2016-2020) [67]. Measured data from irrigated sites
    and dryland sites were used for calibration and validation, respectively, for
    different maturity groups. As shown in Table 2, the calibrated coefficients captured
    the variation in growing season length and differences in growth patterns among
    the maturity groups. The developed cultivar files were included in idCROP so users
    can select the maturity group that best represents the cultivar they plant. Table

    bias error (Eq. S5). 2.5. Real-time weather forecasts To provide real-time weather
    forecasts throughout the growing season, idCROP combines four weather data sources:
    (1) historical weather data, (2) real-time data, (3) forecasted daily short-term
    weather data for 16 days, and (4) forecasted daily seasonal weather data for six
    months. Historical weather data until the day before the date of simulation (or
    app use) was obtained from the nearest West Texas Mesonet weather station [68].
    Missing weather data was filled with two other sources, including the National
    Climatic Data Center data [69] and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)
    data [70]. For real-time data, on-site weather station can be set up by the users
    who choose to deploy sensors. For the users without on-site weather station, idCROP
    would automatically obtain real-time data from the nearest West Texas Mesonet
    weather station. Daily short-term forecasted weather data was obtained from the
    Global Forecast System (GFS) for a 16-day period [71]. GFS provides global weather
    forecast every six hours with a 0.5° spatial resolution and 3-hr temporal resolution,
    including daily maximum temperature (Tmax), daily minimum temperature (Tmin),
    precipitation, and solar radiation. The most recent forecast cycle was used for
    the real-time forecast. Daily forecasted seasonal weather data was obtained for
    six months from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) forecasting system.
    NMME is an experimental real-time seasonal forecast system, which provides daily
    global weather forecasts with an 11-month lead time at 1° spatial resolution (approximately
    110 km at the equator) based on ensemble simulations (10 ensembles for each model)
    of several state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models (GCMs). An improved
    statistical downscaling method with corrections for both mean and variability
    [72,73] was used to produce daily data at a 1-km resolution (Eq. S6). The GFS
    hindcast data (2008-2019) and Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries
    (DAYMET, version 4) (2008-2019) at 1 km resolution were used for calibration of
    downscaled data. As shown in Fig. 5, the downscaled GFS data captured the variations
    of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation very well at the farm level. The calibrated parameters
    for the short forecast downscaling method can be found in Fig. S3-S5. Download

    and DAYMET data (1982-2010) were used for validation of the downscaling parameters
    for the seasonal weather forecasts using the same statistical downscaling method
    that is being used for the validation of short-term weather forecasts. In the
    current version of idCROP, we have successfully downscaled data from one NMME
    model (i.e., Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model version 4, CanCM4) [74], to
    1 km spatial resolution over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS). As shown in Fig. 6,
    the original CanCM4 data overestimated Tmax and Tmin in most regions. The downscaled
    CanCM4 data captured the seasonal variation of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation at
    the farm level. The calibrated parameters for the seasonal forecast downscaling
    method can be found in Figs. S6 - S8. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    of each year. Comparisons of (c) monthly maximum temperature, (f) monthly minimum

    the Texas Rolling Plains region. A step-by-step procedure for generating updated
    daily weather forecasts covering the entire growing season is depicted in Fig.
    7. For the short-term (16-day) forecasted data from GFS, daily Tmax, Tmin, precipitation,
    and solar radiation were calculated as the maximum, minimum, sum, and mean of
    the sub-daily forecasts, respectively, from the most recent forecast cycle at
    0.5° × 0.5° spatial resolution. The 0.5° × 0.5° resolution data was then downscaled
    to 1 km using the calibrated downscaling parameters. Download : Download high-res
    image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Flowchart showing weather
    data inputs and processing in idCROP. For the seasonal forecast (up to six months),
    the ensemble means were first calculated to produce the daily weather forecast
    at 1° × 1° spatial resolution. The 1° × 1° data was then downscaled to 1 km using
    the validated downscaling parameters. The forecasted seasonal solar radiation
    data is not available from the data source, and hence it was calculated using
    Tmax, Tmin, and extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra) data as suggested by Allen
    et al. [75]. The historic weather data file starts several months before the planting
    date, ensuring the warm-up of the DSSAT model. The real-time and short-term weather
    files were updated daily, and the seasonal forecast weather file was updated monthly.
    The forecasted data would be replaced by the newly available real-time weather
    data as the growing season progresses to improve the reliability of crop yield
    and irrigation water requirement predictions. 2.6. Economic model The economic
    model in idCROP was developed based on an enterprise budget approach, which provides
    visual analytics for irrigation decision support and tradeoff analysis. It combines
    farm input and output data with corresponding prices from online sources. Users
    can compare the net returns for selected irrigation levels and understand net
    return changes due to price fluctuation. Net returns were defined as the difference
    between total revenues and total variable and fixed costs. The total revenues
    for selected irrigation levels are based on the simulated crop yield and the crop
    price at the harvest. The lint and seed yields were estimated as 58.6% and 41.4%
    of the DSSAT-simulated seed cotton yield, respectively [76]. Both seed and lint
    prices were decided based on market prices as mentioned below. Then, the net returns
    for selected irrigation levels (NRj, $ per ha) are calculated as follows: (5)
    where Yij is the lint or seed yield at the selected irrigation level j simulated
    by DSSAT, kg ha−1; Pi is the price for lint or seed at harvest, $ ha−1; Variable_costmj
    is the mth type of variable cost at the selected irrigation level j, $ per ha;
    and Fixed_costnj is the nth type of fixed cost at the selected irrigation level
    j. Variable costs include expenses on seed, fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides,
    labor, fuel, machine repair and maintenance, irrigation application, custom hired
    machinery, and equipment for planting and chemical applications if applicable,
    insurance, interest, and custom harvest. Fixed costs include depreciation and
    opportunity costs of planting, tillage and spraying machinery and equipment, irrigation
    equipment, other assets, and land lease costs if applicable. These data were obtained
    from the enterprise budget for Texas A&M AgriLife Extension District 3 [77], which
    is embedded in idCROP by default. These prices can also be adjusted by users based
    on their own farm-level data or their own regional enterprise budget. Typical
    variable and fixed costs are detailed in Table S8 and Table S9. To provide more
    accurate estimates of total revenues, harvest crop prices were estimated using
    the contract future market price at harvest time plus/minus the average price
    basis for each location during harvest. The default cotton future market prices
    were based on the future market contracts from the New York market [78]. Users
    can also adjust the harvest prices based on their price marketing strategy for
    that season. Additionally, idCROP allows users to evaluate the net return changes
    at alternative price levels by performing sensitivity analysis using the above-mentioned
    harvest price as basis (i.e., harvest price ±20%) for selected irrigation levels.
    The app also provides breakeven prices (i.e., the minimum price required to cover
    variable costs, Eq. 6) and total costs (Eq. 7), for selected irrigation levels.
    (6) (7) 2.7. Crop model-based irrigation scheduling algorithm in idCROP For crop
    model-based irrigation scheduling, future irrigation scheduling throughout the
    growing season is predicted using the ET-based automatic irrigation algorithm
    in DSSAT (i.e., setting IRRIG = E in DSSAT). For the ET-based automatic irrigation,
    the accumulation of ET demand (ACCUM_ET) was updated daily, which was calculated
    as the daily potential plant transpiration plus actual soil evaporation minus
    infiltration from rainfall. The idCROP app sets an ET demand threshold of 25 mm
    (i.e., IMDEP =25) and irrigation is triggered if ACCUM_ET ≥ 25 mm. Then, the irrigation
    amount is the accumulated ET demand multiplied by the deficit percentage (ITHRU)
    (i.e., ACCUM_ET × ITHRU/100). The ITHRU is determined by the user. For example,
    if a user wants to apply 90% ET replacement (i.e., ITHRU=90), then the irrigation
    amount is 0.9 × ACCUM_ET. The lower threshold of available water (ITHRL) is set
    as 20 to ensure a low ET replacement strategy (e.g., 30% ET) can be successfully
    executed by DSSAT. In addition, the minimum number of days between irrigation
    events is kept at three to avoid unreasonable results. The DSSAT parameter setting
    for different irrigation strategies is detailed in Table 3. When actual irrigations
    differ from idCROP scenarios, corrections on appropriate dates can be entered
    and confirmed. Table 3. Crop model-based irrigation scheduling setting in idCROP.

    3. Results 3.1. Major outputs of idCROP Major outputs of idCROP include irrigation
    schedules, seasonal irrigation requirements, estimated water use efficiency, and
    expected yield and net returns. Water use efficiency is defined as the yield produced
    per unit of water applied. Fig. 8 illustrates the major outputs of idCROP under
    different irrigation strategies (i.e., 0%, 30%, 60%, and 90% ET replacements).
    With these outputs, users can compare the simulation output intuitively and choose
    an irrigation strategy that best fits their irrigation capacity, yield, and economic
    goals. Download : Download high-res image (770KB) Download : Download full-size

    First, historical weather data from 1991 to 2020 are used to test the performance
    of crop model-based irrigation scheduling algorithm in idCROP under different
    irrigation strategies. As shown in Fig. 9, seed cotton yield showed an increasing
    trend as the ET-replacement level increased from 0% to 100%, and the corresponding
    seasonal irrigation amount also consistently increased as the irrigation level
    increased. Also, a reasonable number of irrigation events were obtained for all
    irrigation strategies. These results demonstrated that the crop model-based irrigation
    scheduling algorithms could effectively simulate the irrigation amount and timing.

    irrigation decision support system in idCROP was then tested at the Chillicothe
    Research Station in the 2020 growing season. As shown in Fig. 10a-c, the seasonal
    weather forecast captured the variation of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation during
    the growing season. To investigate the reliability of idCROP at different lead
    times, predictions of seed cotton yield, seasonal irrigation demand, and precipitation
    with 0 to 5-month lead times were further examined (Fig. 10d-f). The cotton growing
    season in the Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions generally starts from
    May and continues to October, suggesting a 5-month lead time. Even at the beginning
    of the season (lead 5-month), idCROP can provide reasonable yield, seasonal irrigation,
    and precipitation forecasts with relative errors ranging from 14% to 18%. For
    seed cotton yield prediction, idCROP showed better performance as time proceeded
    in the growing season. However, seasonal irrigation requirements showed relatively
    large variability due to the combined effect of predicted temperature and precipitation.

    outputs from idCROP for the experiment at the Chillicothe Research Station during
    the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons are illustrated in Fig. 11. Seed cotton yield
    showed an increasing trend as the ET-replacement level increased from 0% to 90%
    ET replacement, and the corresponding total costs consistently increased likewise
    as more irrigation was applied (Fig. 11a). The highest net return was found using
    the 90% ET replacement. A detailed analysis of different fixed (22%) and variable
    costs (78%) for the 90% ET replacement is also provided in Fig. 11b. Custom machine
    hires accounted for the largest proportion (39%) of total costs. Download : Download

    lint yields. Sensitivity analysis of the net returns at different harvest prices
    is illustrated in Fig. 11c, which shows changes in net return due to price fluctuation.
    In addition, idCROP provides breakeven prices at different lint yields (Fig. 11d).
    With this information, users can identify the paths to increase their profits
    and secure financial incentives with limited irrigation. 4. Discussion Compared
    to existing irrigation decision support systems, idCROP has several advantages,
    including (1) high-resolution and improved real-time weather forecasts combining
    historic, real-time, and short-term (16-day) and seasonal (6-month) forecasted
    weather; (2) an advanced economic model, enabling the calculation of net returns
    and breakeven prices with consideration of price-cost variability. Users can compare
    the simulation output intuitively and choose an irrigation strategy that best
    fits their irrigation capacity, yield, and economic goals and also switch from
    one strategy to other depending on changes in irrigation water availability at
    any time during the growing season; (3) improved site-specific accuracy by combining
    crop model-based irrigation scheduling with on-farm, non-contact sensor data that
    can be used to improve the irrigation schedules. Currently, the short-term and
    seasonal weather forecasts have already been calibrated over the CONUS at 1-km
    resolution, which has not been incorporated into currently available irrigation
    scheduling systems. This forecasted weather can be corrected with on-site weather
    data as the growing season progresses, enabling a reliable weather forecast covering
    the growing season. idCROP updates and extends the economic analysis by providing
    crop net returns estimates, price sensitivity analysis, and breakeven prices based
    on enterprise budgets by combining farm input and output data with corresponding
    prices from online sources. These economic analyses enable users to choose an
    irrigation strategy that best fits their irrigation capacity and secure financial
    incentives, which is also not available in any existing irrigation scheduling
    decision support systems [8]. Along with the tool, a ticket-based response system
    is implemented and maintained to capture and document the status of all user inquiries,
    suggestions, and trouble reports. This feedback will help prioritize modifications/refinements
    of the system moving forward. The app performance for sensor-based irrigation
    scheduling has not been rigorously tested and verified. In the 2020 and 2021 cotton
    growing seasons, preliminary data were gathered on the WDI water stress index
    using a pivot-mounted sensor at the Chillicothe Research Station. The calculation
    of WDI is detailed in section S4 and Table 10. The data from 2020 indicated a
    strong relationship between WDI and water stress in cotton (Fig. 12a). A relatively
    stable WDI trend in the four ET-based water management regimes was observed when
    the soil between crop rows was not visible to the temperature sensor mounted on
    the phenotyping system (shortly after 60 days of planting). Efforts to address
    the issue before canopy closure are in progress, and the preliminary data in 2021
    (not shown) with nearly bare soil surface showed a relatively stable WDI trend
    under irrigated conditions. The strong relationship between the seasonal average
    WDI and observed cotton seed yield (Fig. 12b) can help us determine WDI thresholds
    for triggering irrigation based on the expected yield/water use. These results
    lead us to conclude that WDI, a modified CWSI method that accounts for canopy
    coverage, can be reliably used as an indicator in precision deficit irrigation
    management. Other preliminary data from the same phenotyping system has shown
    spectral reflectance sensors to be highly accurate in estimating canopy coverage.
    With temperature and spectral reflectance sensors mounted directly to a pivot
    irrigation system, WDI can provide a precise irrigation schedule according to
    the desired level of water deficit, especially when paired with model predictions
    of crop growth and water use. Taghvaeian et al. [8] analyzed irrigation scheduling
    practices in the U.S. in the past ten years and pointed out that water and energy
    could be significantly saved if plant sensor-based methods are part of the irrigation
    scheduling toolsets. Download : Download high-res image (238KB) Download : Download

    management regimes as a function of time (a) and the relationship between seasonal
    average WDI and cotton seed yield (b) during the 2020 growing season at Chillicothe,
    TX. There are several limitations in the current version of idCROP. First, the
    utility of the existing idCROP app prototype is limited to cotton production in
    the Texas Rolling Plains region. However, more crops simulated by DSSAT and any
    field in the CONUS can be added in the future. This can be done by including additional
    information related to soils, cultivars, and crop management, as well as extending
    the geographic extent for the creation of automated weather data files. Second,
    the seasonal weather forecast shows considerable uncertainties, especially for
    precipitation. To reduce the uncertainty in seasonal weather forecasts, we will
    include other NMME models that are being updated every month, including Community
    Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) [79], and Goddard Earth Observing System
    (GEOS-5) [80]. Third, the continued availability of real-time and short-term forecasted
    weather data for the app could sometimes be challenging. This challenge could
    be overcome by setting different priority levels for different weather sources.
    For example, weather data from an on-site weather station, if available, would
    be given the highest priority for historic and current weather data, followed
    by data from the nearest weather station (e.g., West Texas Mesonet), NCDC station,
    and NARR gridded dataset. If these data are not available, the short-term and
    seasonal forecasted data can be used as backup data. Conclusions The idCROP tool
    simplifies the application of DSSAT cropping system model for irrigation scheduling
    with minimal inputs required from the user. Users can provide just basic management
    information such as planting date, row spacing, seed rate, cultivar types, irrigation,
    fertilizer, and chemical applied date and amounts. To provide more realistic soil
    data, idCROP identifies dominant soil types using SSURGO and CDL datasets and
    specifies soil physical properties using the Official Soil Series Descriptions.
    The idCROP app pairs historic and forecasted weather throughout the growing season
    along with recorded irrigations to provide reliable irrigation recommendations
    that are optimized in real-time. The app generates prescriptions for several irrigation
    strategies that users can compare to know how different irrigation schedules affect
    the yield and net returns. We have also tested on-farm sensors mounted on pivot
    irrigation systems to improve the accuracy of irrigation recommendations, although
    the app can be used without the additional sensor data. The prototype idCROP app
    has been deployed to a small group of evaluators on both iOS and Android mobile
    devices. Although the utility of the existing idCROP app prototype is limited
    to cotton production in the Texas Rolling Plains region, more crops and any field
    in the CONUS can be added to idCROP in the future with additional information
    related to soils, cultivars, and crop management, as well as extending the geographic
    extent for the creation of automated weather data files. Supplementary information

    various parameters used in idCROP, downscaling methods, and water deficit index
    calculation in addition to 10 tables and 8 figures. Declaration of Competing Interest

  limitations: The prototype is currently only applicable to cotton production in
    the Texas Rolling Plains region (though the authors state that additional crops
    and locations can be added), the weather forecast has significant uncertainties,
    and the continuous availability of real-time and short-term forecasted weather
    data could be challenging.

  title: Development and evaluation of a decision support mobile application for cotton
    irrigation management
  verbatim_quote1: The app was built based on the crop simulation model, Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), and a newly developed economic
    model to provide real-time irrigation schedules and projected economic outcomes
    based on water use and production goals.
  verbatim_quote2: The irrigation schedules can be improved by optional remote detection
    of plant water stress using a sensor platform mounted on a pivot irrigation system,
    but the app can be used without the sensors in conjunction with any type of irrigation
    system.

- analysis: 'The paper explores the application of the Simplified Surface Energy Balance
    Index (S-SEBI) model for estimating actual evapotranspiration (ET) using Landsat
    8/9 data. The study evaluates the model''s performance against eddy covariance
    measurements over an irrigated agricultural farm in India. The paper is pertinent
    to the review''s focus on Considerations: volume, frequency, format, and source
    of the data under Section 3.1 Irrigation Management Data. The paper provides insights
    into the use of satellite data for ET estimation, which aligns with the review''s
    intention of evaluating automated irrigation management systems that integrate
    IoT and machine learning technologies.


    The paper highlights the importance of accurate ET estimation for efficient irrigation
    water management and emphasizes the potential of remote sensing-based models for
    near-real-time ET monitoring. The study''s findings demonstrate the capabilities
    of the S-SEBI model in capturing ET variations across different land use types
    within the farm. The authors acknowledge the model''s limitations, such as underestimation
    during the initial growing season and overestimation during mid-season, which
    are important considerations for practical applications.


    The paper contributes to the review''s objective of examining automation across
    the entire pipeline of irrigation management. By focusing on data collection and
    processing, the study provides valuable information on the use of satellite remote
    sensing for data acquisition. The insights gained from this paper can inform the
    review''s discussion on integrating data collection and analysis components within
    automated irrigation systems.


    Overall, the paper addresses key aspects of the review''s outline point and contributes
    to the broader understanding of automated irrigation management systems.'

  description: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in the energy and water
    balance of agricultural ecosystems and is a vital component of the hydrological
    cycle. Efficient irrigation water management relies on accurate spatiotemporal
    coverage of crop ET across a farm. Thanks to the availability of multi-temporal
    high-resolution satellite datasets and remote sensing-based surface energy balance
    models, near-real-time estimation of ET is now possible. This study utilized Landsat
    8/9 data to estimate ET using the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI)
    model, which was then compared to eddy covariance measurements over a semi-arid
    agricultural farm in New Delhi, India during the post-monsoon periods of 2021-22
    and 2022-23. The S-SEBI model predicted daily ET from Landsat 8/9 data with an
    average correlation coefficient and RMSE of 0.89 and 0.79 mm/day, respectively.
    The spatiotemporal map was also used to evaluate the model’s performance, and
    it could accurately differentiate between ET over dryland crops and well-irrigated
    wheat fields on the farm. Despite underestimating ET (0.51 mm/day) during the
    initial growing season (Nov-Dec) and overestimating it (0.73 mm/day) during mid-season
    (Feb-Mar), the S-SEBI model can still be an operational tool for mapping ET with
    high accuracy and sufficient variation across pixels, making it an ideal option
    for incorporating into irrigation scheduling.

- analysis: 'The PLANTSENS system presented in this study utilizes a rail-based multi-sensor
    imaging system to detect water stress in greenhouse crops. It combines absorption-based,
    using shortwave infrared, and temperature-based measurements using thermal imagery
    to provide redundant and accurate water stress assessment. The choice of sensors
    and the multi-sensor approach is well-grounded, as water stress manifests in both
    spectral reflectance and thermal properties of plant leaves.


    The methodology for determining irrigation time based on the fusion of water index
    (WI) and crop water stress index (CWSI) is well-conceived. WI is derived from
    the reflectance difference at 1450 and 1300 nm, while CWSI utilizes the relationship
    between leaf temperature and transpiration rate. By merging these two indices,
    the system improves its reliability and accuracy in detecting water stress.


    The results presented demonstrate the effectiveness of the PLANTSENS system in
    detecting water stress. The study includes a series of measurements on tomato
    plants grown in a greenhouse, and the measured data align well with the expected
    patterns of water stress. The system successfully differentiates between stressed
    and non-stressed plants based on both WI and CWSI values.


    The research further investigates the prediction of irrigation trigger points
    using slope changes in WI and CWSI. By analyzing the rate of change of these indices,
    the system identifies the optimal time to initiate irrigation, ensuring timely
    and precise water delivery. The inclusion of vapor conductance as a complementary
    indicator strengthens the reliability of the irrigation scheduling algorithm.


    Overall, the PLANTSENS system offers a comprehensive approach to real-time water
    stress detection and automated irrigation management. It combines advanced sensing
    technologies with robust data analysis and decision-making algorithms. The system''s
    performance has been validated through extensive measurements, demonstrating its
    potential to optimize water usage, enhance crop productivity, and support sustainable
    agriculture practices.'

  description: The production of fruits and vegetables in a protected environment
    (e.g., greenhouse) and open field mainly depends on a substantial water supply.
    Water stress is the most common plant stress, significantly affecting the quality
    and yield of crops, especially in organic plant cultivation and arid regions.
    An automated and well-scheduled irrigation system that corresponds to the actual
    water demand helps reduce the consumption of this limited resource without negatively
    affecting crop productivity. This study outlines the design, construction, and
    functionality of an autonomous multi-sensor monitoring system for real-time water
    stress detection and precisely targeted irrigation called PLANTSENS. The developed
    prototype combines the absorption-based and the temperature-based measuring method
    by using three optical sensors operating in the near-infrared, shortwave, and
    longwave (thermal) infrared spectrum. The camera modules are mounted on a moving
    rail-based platform with an integrated positioning system. Appropriate networking
    and cloud environment with a central server for storing, analyzing, and visualizing
    the acquired data was created. PLANTSENS monitoring system has been successfully
    implemented and trained on tomato plants in a greenhouse. The algorithm for scheduling
    irrigation time has been developed by merging two water stress detection algorithms,
    namely the Water Index (WI) and the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), thereby improving
    the system's capability and accuracy. WI determines the plant stress from the
    reflection differences at 1450 and 1300 nm, where water absorbs strongly and weakly,
    respectively. CWSI, on the other hand, uses the leaf temperature, which tends
    to increase during water stress due to the lower transpiration rate caused by
    closed stomata. This work presents the performance of investigated measuring methods
    and developed algorithms based on the system approach from July 2020 through August
    2020. The obtained irrigation time has been verified in accordance with observed
    changes in the plant's physiological response, such as vapor conductivity, validating
    this approach as promising and confirming water stress as a significant indicator
    in irrigation scheduling.

    imageryCrop water stress index 1. Introduction Water is one of the essential resources
    for all living organisms, including plants, required to permit their vital processes
    [1]. However, the increasing demand for water worldwide due to climate change
    calls for sustainable use of this limited and expensive resource, especially in
    the agriculture sector, which accounts for about 70 % of all water withdrawal
    extracted from surface water and groundwater globally [2]. Agriculture is a complex
    production process involving various interdependent factors, such as irrigation
    scheduling, regulating both quality and productivity. Irrigation has a major impact
    on crop yield in protected environments (e. g., greenhouse) without a natural
    water supply (rainwater) and open fields, especially for organic plant cultivation
    in arid regions where water availability is limited. Furthermore, an additional
    water supply is often used in semi-arid and humid areas to increase crop productivity
    [3]. Appropriately scheduled and precisely targeted irrigation according to the
    actual water shortage conditions of the crops enables sustainable use of this
    limited resource and avoids environmental problems such as groundwater pollution
    and runoff [4,5]. Moreover, an intelligent and automated irrigation system is
    an immense support and a time-saver for farmers. The system monitors the crop
    water status automatically and continuously, assisting the farmer in determining
    precisely when and where to apply irrigation [6]. Nevertheless, achieving this
    delicate balance between efficient water use without lowering crop productivity
    is highly challenging. Integrating new sensor and application technologies such
    as drones, multi- and hyperspectral infrared imagery, or modern navigation systems
    may improve individual procedures associated with increasing yield and reducing
    water consumption. As thermal sensors and multispectral imagers became more affordable,
    compact, and lightweight, these devices can be implemented on self-driving or
    self-flying carrier-based platforms. This makes it possible to monitor larger
    crops in a shorter amount of time, collecting the samples more frequently. Furthermore,
    modern single board computers (SBC), designed for computer vision and embedded
    applications, are capable of delivering the performance and power efficiency needed
    to acquire and analyze image data, almost in real-time. The average temperature
    in summer 2022 was noticed as the highest in Europe''s recorded history [7]. Climate
    change is the main reason many countries invest in research and innovation programs
    to make agriculture smarter and more sustainable. For instance, smart farming
    was the major priority for Germany''s Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture
    (ger: Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft, BMEL) over the past
    three years. The Ministry has earmarked EUR 50 million for the digitalization
    and modernization of the agriculture sector [8]. New digital solutions enable
    the farming sector to use limited resources more carefully and efficiently. R&D
    PLANTSENS was one of the projects funded by the BMEL. This study was motivated
    by the lack of an innovative, decision-support system to monitor the crop water
    status in real-time remotely. The objectives of this work were to develop and
    field test a multi-sensor control system for automated and targeted crop irrigation
    in the open field and protected areas [9], [10], [11]. The absorption-based and
    temperature-based measuring methods have become very popular for water stress
    detection in the past decade. The proposed concept combines and improves both
    techniques using modern optical sensors to offer redundancy and increased accuracy
    of the decision algorithms. In this study, we explained the process of image data
    analysis and investigated the effectiveness of both methods in stress detection.
    Finally, we proposed a suitable method for estimating optimal irrigation time
    before the plant starts suffering from water shortage. Such a hybrid remote sensing
    system may lead to the improvement of real-time plant canopy health, growth, and
    quality monitoring [12]. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:
    Section 2 reviews related literature on water stress detection. Section 3 outlines
    the design, construction, and functionality of technical components of the monitoring
    system. The characteristics of the optical sensors and the redundancy concept
    are presented. Furthermore, Section 3 explains the importance of the meteorological
    station in temperature-based water stress detection and the development of prediction
    algorithms for leaf temperature limits required for this method. The experimental
    setup and data collection are inserted in Section 4. The results and effectiveness
    of the system are presented and discussed in Section 5. The paper is concluded
    with future work plans in Section 6. 2. Research background Plant stress can be
    classified into two primary categories, namely (1) abiotic stress and (2) biotic
    stress [12,13]. Abiotic factors are physical or chemical changes in the environment,
    such as drought, excessive watering, and extreme temperatures, while biotic factors
    are biological units like diseases, fungi, or insects [13]. Various changes in
    environmental conditions may disturb physiological processes, consequently causing
    plant stress that affects growth, development, or productivity. For instance,
    abiotic plant stress induced by insufficient water supply could result in further
    morphological changes such as leaf curling to loss of cell turgidity or even leaf
    scorch if not treated in time. In that case, when the symptoms are evolved far
    enough to be detected with the bare human eye, the crop is already suffering under
    a higher degree of water stress, negatively affecting crop yield, especially in
    intensive crop production systems. Since water has a significant impact on plant
    physiological functions, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake
    [1], most crops are highly susceptible to water deficiency with minimal changes
    in water availability [14]. Water deficit stress is one of the most common plant
    stresses [5,15]. The established methods for water stress detection can be categorized
    into soil-based measures, direct sensing of plant water status parameters, and
    indirect sensing of plant response to stress [16,17]. Soil moisture sensors are
    conventional devices easy to apply in practice and used for irrigation control
    purposes. This method measures soil water content and water potential. As the
    water deficiency does not occur simultaneously in all spots, the assessed degree
    of water deficit stress imposed on the plants does not necessarily represent the
    water deficit stress level that the plants actually experience [18]. It means
    that a lower level of soil moisture could be adequate at the time of less intensive
    evapotranspiration but not necessarily at times of high evaporative demand [18].
    Another disadvantage is the high number of sensors often required for heterogeneity
    and precise monitoring, making the system quite expensive and difficult to maintain.
    However, more advanced direct sensing techniques for quantifying crop moisture
    stress detection, such as pressure chambers or leaf diffusion porometers, are
    more accurate but labor-intensive, destructive, and time-consuming [2,15,17,19].
    The pressure chamber measures the xylem water potential of sample leaves removed
    from the growing plant, and the leaf diffusion porometers investigate stomatal
    conductance using a portable chamber system [15]. In recent decades, indirect
    measurements of plant stress gained more importance due to the technical improvement
    of remote sensors, especially imaging systems. Numerous studies have explored
    various indicators related to the measured temperature of leaf surface or spectral
    absorption of leaf water content. This technique has a clear advantage over direct
    stress detection, as infrared thermography and optical spectroscopy do not require
    any physical contact with the plant leaves, i.e., the monitoring process is non-invasive.
    Moreover, soil-based and direct sensing methods sample the parameters at a single
    position on a single plant or plant part, illustrating only the average conditions.
    Hence, those techniques are not suitable for crops on a larger scale due to the
    limited number of individuals that can be monitored simultaneously [19]. Remote
    imaging systems are able to observe an area of interest, rather than just a single
    point, when installed on a moving platform. 2.1. Absorption-based water stress
    detection Leaves interact with sunlight at all wavelengths across the visible
    (VIS, 400 - 700 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 700 - 1000 nm), and shortwave infrared
    spectrum (SWIR, 1000 - 3000 nm, also termed middle infrared) [[20], [21]]. Their
    optical properties depend mainly on biochemical (chlorophyll) and biophysical
    (cell structure) characteristics. For example, typical absorption observable in
    the visible light spectrum is caused by photosynthetic pigments since water absorbs
    very weakly in this range [18]. In contrast, higher reflectance of the visible
    light by the leaf surface indicates reduced chlorophyll content resulting in poor
    photosynthesis. However, machine vision is not capable to use direct reflectance
    measurements as a metric for plant stress detection, which is why reflectance
    indices (RI) are used. RI is a combination of two or more spectral bands [12].
    According to the chlorophyll example, patterns of absorption and reflections can
    be used to detect changes in leaf functional properties, consequently indicating
    plant stress. One of the most famous indicators using this principle is the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) explored by Rouse et al. (1974) [22]. NDVI
    quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared (NIR;
    vegetation strongly reflects) and red light reflection (R; vegetation absorbs).
    (1) Water is next to chlorophyll, the second strongest absorbing molecule in leaves
    [20]. The spectral characteristics of water are primarily focused on the near-infrared
    region and shortwave infrared, as leaves normally do not contain other substances
    that absorb strongly in this range. Water exhibits maxima in the 970, 1200, 1450,
    1950, and 2500 nm ranges [23,24]. Once the plant is dehydrating and water is lost
    from the leaf, absorption decreases, and reflectance tends to increase in those
    wavelengths [25]. Since the absorption of radiation is heavily influenced by water
    and dry matter in the leaves, it has been considered a valuable method for water
    stress detection. Various spectral indices for the remote assessment of plant
    water stress have been developed by combining water absorption bands of different
    sensitivity. Penuelas et al. (1997) [26] defined the water index (WI) as a ratio
    of reflectance at 900 (low water absorption) and 970 nm (high water absorption):
    (2) Seelig et al. (2009) [18], on the other hand, focused on the maxima in SWIR
    and defined WI as: (3) where and represent the spectral reflectances at 1300 and
    1450 nm, respectively. Gao (1996) [27] explored the water stress index similar
    to NDVI by normalizing the differences in the reflectance. Gao (1996) defined
    the normalized difference water index (NDWI) as: (4) where and are the spectral
    reflectances at 860 and 1240 nm, respectively. In fact, the absorption in near-infrared
    at 970 and 1200 nm is significantly lower compared to more sensitive shortwave
    infrared at 1450 or 1950 nm. However, the availability of spectra at 1450, 1950,
    and 2500 nm in the sunlight reaching the earth''s surface is limited due to the
    atmospheric water vapor. Consequently, Seelig''s method is difficult to implement,
    especially in environments where external light sources are unavailable. Therefore,
    many studies focused on near-infrared wavelengths defining different water indices:
    (5) with being the wavelengths 850, 880 or 900 nm for estimating water content
    in different species. 2.2. Temperature-based water stress detection Plant roots
    absorb water from the soil transporting it to stems and leaves for different vital
    processes such as transpiration [1,28]. Under stress-free conditions, water transpired
    by the plants evaporates and cools the leaves [3]. An imbalance between the water
    absorbed by the roots and the amount of water lost through transpiration increases
    plant stress [15]. Indirect detection of plant water stress is often based on
    leaf temperature, which is inversely correlated with transpiration and stomatal
    opening [16]. This effect is based on the fact that an insufficient water supply
    under a higher ambient temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) results in
    the closure of leaf stomata, increasing crop temperature [29,30]. Jackson et al.
    (1981) [31] demonstrated that the degree of water stress is directly proportional
    to the canopy temperature. Idso et al. (1981) [32] and Jackson et al. (1981) [31]
    presented a method for quantifying this stress by determining the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) as: (6) where is the current canopy temperature, represents the temperature
    of leaves transpiring at the maximum potential rate by stomata being completely
    open and is the temperature of non-transpiring leaves where the stomata are assumed
    to be fully closed [15,[33], [34]]. The CWSI tends towards 0 after irrigation
    and moves continuously towards 1 as soil water becomes limiting [6]. The most
    difficult step in the CWSI approach is to determine the boundaries for the upper
    and lower limit corresponding to the maximum stress and non-stress condition,
    respectively. The maximum ( ) and minimum ( ) temperature can be estimated empirically
    or theoretically. The empirical form is simple in implementation as it makes use
    of dry and wet reference surfaces. One of the methods has been proposed by Jones
    et al. (2002) [14] in which leaves sprayed with water are used as a wet reference
    and leaves covered in petroleum jelly as a dry reference [35]. The computation
    of CWSI based on the theoretical form is more complicated because it refers to
    the canopy energy balance model and requires observation of additional parameters,
    such as incoming solar radiation and wind speed. In this study, the authors followed
    the empirical methodology investigating the correlation between the environmental
    conditions and the minimum and maximum leaf temperature. Based on these measurements,
    specific algorithms have been created that allow real-time calculation of those
    temperature limits without the need to use any reference surfaces. 3. Material
    and methods In this research work, a multi-sensor photogrammetric monitoring system
    for automated remote water stress detection has been designed and implemented
    to improve the production process while controlling water supply and increasing
    yield. The conceived and built prototype has been successfully tested in a greenhouse
    environment at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences (ger: Berliner Hochschule
    für Technik, BHT). The PLANTSENS system was initially developed as a rail-based
    construction for kinematic measurements. The measuring unit is mounted on a self-driving
    platform, moving over the crops and acquiring images of the top leaves of tomato
    plants (Fig. 1(a)). In order to irrigate the plants individually, the position
    of the camera unit must be determined. The current position is given through a
    combination of a stepper motor (Fig. 1 (b)) counting the traveled distance and
    an inertial measurement unit (IMU) (Fig. 1 (c)) measuring changes in direction.
    This method is known as dead reckoning, where the position update results from
    the estimated movement added to the previously determined location. The calculated
    location is assigned to the image as a position index. The individual pixels are
    not georeferenced; instead, the position refers to the entire image as a whole.

    crops and taking images of the top leaves of tomato plants; (b) Front view of
    the measuring robot; (c) Top view of the measuring robot. Due to its portability,
    the measuring system can be used in different application scenarios. Furthermore,
    in the current version, the camera module is completely removable, enabling the
    stationary observation of plants. 3.1. Networking and communication According
    to Fig. 2, the system setup consists of these three components: (1) a measuring
    robot for parallel image acquisition in different wavelengths, (2) a central server
    for data storing, analysis, and alarming functions, and (3) a meteorological station
    recording environmental parameters [9]. The measuring robot and the meteorological
    station are located in the greenhouse, while the central server is placed externally.
    The hardware components are connected using the traditional client-server communication
    model. For this purpose, the already existing BHT network architecture has been
    utilized and extended by a separate local subnetwork within the greenhouse [9].

    Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of the network connection within the PLANTSENS system
    [36]. The server and router are connected to the parent network via a physical
    link (LAN) and communicate accordingly. Since the measurement sensors are mounted
    on a movable carrier platform, the transmission of the sensor data is wireless
    via the router''s 5 GHz radio link (WLAN), ensuring server access [9]. A fundamental
    part of an automated monitoring system is a stable and real-time messaging mechanism
    to integrate sensors and actuators. The message queue and telemetry transport
    protocol (MQTT) enables event-based data transmission between devices. The protocol
    implements the so-called publish/subscribe communication concept with a message-passing
    broker in the center. Basically, an event represents information, such as measured
    temperature, that one sensor wants to share (publish) with other devices. Every
    single message is tagged using a topic name. Actuators related to the messages
    must subscribe to the appropriate topic. The broker is responsible for receiving
    published messages, filtering the topic names, and forwarding the messages to
    subscribed clients. Moreover, the MQTT protocol offers additional mechanisms such
    as quality of service (QoS) and last will and testament (LWT) to improve communication
    reliability and facilitate appropriate action in case of ungracefully connection
    loss [36]. QoS defines the guarantee of delivery for a message at three levels:
    (0) at most once, (1) at least once, and (2) exactly once. Additionally, a client
    can specify an LWT message when connecting to a broker. The broker stores this
    message and sends it to all subscribed clients of the LWT message topic if the
    client disconnects unexpectedly. This feature can be used to implement various
    strategies in the case of a sensor''s connection loss. 3.2. Multi-sensor measuring
    robot The core of the PLANTSENS monitoring system is the multi-sensor measuring
    robot for automated image acquisition and processing. As shown in Fig. 3, the
    PLANTSENS prototype is divided into the operating and control unit, located in
    the upper and the measuring head in the lower part of the housing. Two stepper
    motors control the robot''s driven position and the acquisition angle of the measuring
    head, which can be rotated horizontally by 360° so that leaves can be captured
    from different angles. Download : Download high-res image (503KB) Download : Download

    supply for stationary measurements. 3.2.1. Operating and control unit Jetson TX2
    System-on-Module (SoM) handles all the measuring and operating processes. Sensors
    and actuators are connected through the Astro Carrier Board, equipped with required
    communication interfaces. The Astro Carrier Board provides a high-density, board-to-board
    connector that allows access to features found on Jetson TX2 (Fig. 4). Download

    illustrated in Fig. 6 consists of three camera sensors: Xenics Bobcat, FLIR Vue
    Pro, and Raspberry Pi NoIR, operating in wavelength range beyond the visible light
    spectrum from 400 to 13,500 nm to capture water stress indicators not detectable
    by the human eye. Furthermore, the camera modules are equipped with additional
    filters so that the optical sensors detect only spectral ranges relevant to water
    stress. The image acquisition for all three cameras is triggered and controlled
    by the SoM Jetson Tegra TX2 simultaneously. Download : Download high-res image

    the concept of redundant water stress detection, including intermediate steps
    for data processing. It combines two measuring methods to increase the system''s
    capability and accuracy. In the first method, the shortwave infrared camera Xenics
    Bobcat determines the reflectance intensity of water in plant tissue. Concurrently,
    the longwave infrared camera FLIR Vue Pro measures the surface temperature of
    plant leaves. A near-infrared digital camera Raspberry Pi is used for object detection
    since plant leaves are difficult to distinguish from the background in a thermal
    image. The final result, irrigation time, is determined by comparing the outcomes
    of both methods. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    water stress detection [9]. 3.2.2.1. Raspberry Pi NoIR Raspberry Pi No-Infrared
    (NoIR) is a low-cost single-chip camera with a built-in \"Sony IMX219\" CMOS sensor.
    Because of the removed infrared filter, the camera module registers the wavelengths
    beyond the visible light (400 to 700 nm) in the near-infrared spectrum (up to
    900 nm), and it can be used to determine the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI). An additional red filter Rosco Storaro was placed in front of lens
    to pass only red and near-infrared spectrum [37]. The NDVI is a parameter that
    reflects the plant''s photosynthetic activity (vitality) based on reflectance
    differences in the near-infrared and red light spectrum. The higher the positive
    difference between the radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) light,
    the higher the photosynthetic activity of the observed object. NDVI ranges from
    -1 to +1. Pixel values above 0.2 represent active photosynthesis. The non-plant
    objects show negative values. Consequently, it allows the identification of vegetation
    (plant) in the image and its differentiation from non-vegetation objects, such
    as soil. Finally, the plant mask can be applied to shortwave infrared and thermal
    images to highlight the plant area and exclude irrelevant information [[9], [37]].
    The camera sensor was calibrated for distortion coefficients using a chessboard
    and OpenCV. Additionally, the image brightness, contrast, exposure time, and saturation
    were fine-tuned to optimize the accuracy of plant detection using NDVI processing.
    3.2.2.2. Xenics Bobcat 320 GigE Xenics Bobcat 320 GigE is a shortwave infrared
    industrial camera that uses an uncooled indium-gallium-arsenic (InGaAs) detector
    sensitive to wavelengths from 900 to 1700 nm, with a 320×256 pixel resolution.
    Since water absorbs strongly at 1450 nm and reflects at 1300 nm, the camera module
    was equipped with two narrow bandpass filters to pass only the required wavelength
    and block the irrelevant electromagnetic spectrum. These filters are placed in
    front of the camera lens, being automatically changed by an integrated slider
    mechanism. A single measurement captures two image data, one per filter. Consequently,
    the water stress is calculated from the reflection differences of the higher (1450
    nm) and lower (1300 nm) water absorption, according to Seelig et al. (2009) (Eq.
    (3)). The resulting index defines the current stress status of a plant and is
    used for determining irrigation time. However, the intensity of shortwave infrared
    radiation available in sunlight differs for 1450 and 1300 nm. Especially, measurements
    at 1450 nm are susceptible to the interfering absorption of the atmosphere, clouds,
    and the blocking effect of the greenhouse roof''s material and require an additional
    light source. A reflectance standard was used to estimate the differences in radiation
    intensity, thus defining the acquisition time individually for both filters. It
    is a diffusing material with high reflectivity of up to 95% over a broad range
    from 250 to 2200 nm. The camera sensor was factory calibrated. However, like any
    other sensor, the camera chip generates electrical signals that can produce noises
    in the captured digital image, even without a light beam passing through the lens.
    To determine and filter out those noises, the lens was closed to prevent photons
    from entering the optics, and multiple images were taken and averaged. The exposure
    time was regulated relative to the reference standard, and the automatic camera
    gain control was disabled. 3.2.2.3. FLIR Vue Pro FLIR Vue Pro is a thermal imaging
    camera with a micro-bolometer sensor that operates in the longwave infrared spectrum
    ranging from 7.5 µm to 13.5 µm, also known as an atmospheric window, in which
    the radiation can pass through the atmosphere. The camera module uses a 9 mm lens
    with a view angle of 35º x 27º and is controlled by pulse-width modulation signals
    (PWM). Image data is stored directly on the integrated memory card in the so-called
    radiometric-jpeg (RJPEG) data format with a resolution of 336×256 px. Unlike the
    typical TIFF and JPEG format, the RJPEG is a type of file that contains both visible
    8-bit and thermal 16-bit information in a single file [37]. This contactless measuring
    method is based on the fact that every object at a temperature above the absolute
    zero point (=0 K) does emit thermal energy. The emitted radiation hits the micro-bolometer
    sensor of the infrared camera, where the detected heat flux gets transformed into
    16-bit digital pixel information. However, on its way to the camera sensor, the
    registered signal (s) is affected by various error factors, such as flux emitted
    by the atmosphere and flux emitted by the ambient [38]. Furthermore, water vapor
    and carbon dioxide absorb parts of the infrared radiation and so cause atmospheric
    transmission losses depending on the acquisition distance. Before converting a
    pixel value to a corresponding object temperature, the registered signal must
    be corrected first. In order to estimate the atmospheric transmission ( ), the
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, and the distance to the plant have to
    be known. Another critical factor is the object''s emissivity ( ), indicating
    how much of the total radiation is emitted [37]. The measurement model for the
    detector signal ( ) corresponding to the total intensity of heat radiation can
    be expressed as [38]: (7) where , and are the detector signals corresponding to
    the object (plant) heat radiation intensity and a black body heat radiation intensity,
    at ambient temperature respectively. The plant emissivity ( ) is typically around
    0.98 and remains relatively constant across all wavelengths [39]. Signal ( ) is
    expressed based on the temperature (To) and camera Planck''s Constants (R, B,
    F) as [38]: (8) The Planck''s Constants (R, B, F) of the camera sensor were factory
    calibrated. Since emissivity measurements are frequently loaded with significant
    errors, the calibration of infrared cameras is essential. Calibration of an infrared
    system is conducted using a technical black body, a surface whose emissivity equals
    over the operating range of the camera. For a short distance the atmospheric transmission
    can be assumed as . Thus, Eq. (7) results in . The calibration is performed by
    measuring signals ( ) corresponding to different temperatures ( ) set on the technical
    black body to determine the constants R, B, and F [40]. (9) 3.3. Meteorological
    station In order to use the CWSI (Eq. (6)) for water stress detection and as an
    indicator for the irrigation trigger point, the upper limit (dry) and lower limit
    (wet) of leaf temperature are required. Both values strongly depend on environmental
    conditions occurring during the measurement, such as air temperature, wet bulb
    temperature, and radiant temperature, and might vary over time. In simple terms,
    a plant cultivated in a greenhouse will have different temperature limits compared
    to measurements in a climate chamber or open field. Furthermore, those values
    also differ depending on the plant type. In this study, the relation between environmental
    data and the maximum and minimum leaf temperature has been investigated for tomato
    plants using the empirical method presented by Jones et al. (2002) [14]. For this
    purpose, the temperatures of wet leaf sprayed with water (Fig. 8 (b)) and dry
    leaf covered with vaseline (Fig. 8 (c)) were observed simultaneously using thermocouples.
    At the same time, wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) information containing radiant
    temperature (globe temperature), air temperature, and wet bulb temperature has
    been collected. In addition, a photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor
    measured the intensity of electromagnetic radiation in the spectral range that
    plants use for photosynthesis (400 – 700 nm). The anemometer, a device for sensing
    wind speed and direction, was not considered for this setup since wind activity
    in the greenhouse is usually non-existent to very low. The setup of the weather
    station is presented in Fig. 8(a). Download : Download high-res image (616KB)

    227 data sets consisting of 60 individual measurements each were taken using a
    data logger ALMEMO 710; the sampling rate was 0.1 Hz. The correlation between
    the environmental data and the measured temperatures of moistened leaf and a leaf
    coated with vaseline was investigated using multiple linear regression. Furthermore,
    the regression analysis revealed that the PAR sensor does not affect the model
    improvement. In this case, taking this parameter out of the calculation is acceptable,
    at least for the greenhouse application. The resulting equations for the lower
    ( ) and upper ( ) limit prediction based on the globe temperature ( ), air temperature
    ( ), and wet bulb temperature ( ) were defined as follows: (10) (11) with a coefficient
    of determination for and for . This result is the key factor for developing a
    non-contact method for estimating crop water stress index, which depends on the
    precise detection of leaf temperature limits according to changing environmental
    conditions. Further calculations on water stress detection using thermal imagery
    are based on this model. 4. Measurements In this study, a series of measurements
    on tomato plants grown in a greenhouse environment were implemented and analyzed
    for water stress detection (Fig. 9(a)). Finally, an adequate method for specifying
    irrigation time has been defined. These experiments were all carried out during
    July and August of 2020. Download : Download high-res image (902KB) Download :

    Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) were grown in crop lines comprising dual-layer
    block-slabs filled with mineral wool (Grodan Delta Roockwool, 10×10×6.5 cm, Fig.
    9(b)). A drip irrigation system distributes the water through a network of valves
    directly into the root zone of the plants (Fig. 9(c)). The measuring process began
    at 9:00 a.m. when plants were most vigorously transpiring. At the beginning of
    each experiment, the drippers were removed from the slabs to let the slab progressively
    dry out over several hours and put the plant under water deficit. On a sunny day
    (temperature above 30 °Celsius), the first signs of water stress became visible
    after two to three hours. At this time, the plant leaves began to wilt. The drippers
    were placed back on the slab as soon as the water stress was visible to the naked
    eye, i.e., leaves hanging limply from the stem. 4.2. Data collection The PLANTSENS
    system was located at a distance of 2 m from the vertical axis of the canopy sampling
    the area of young, fully developed leaves (Fig. 10). Due to the high water absorption
    in the wavelength range of 1450 nm and the blocking effect of the greenhouse''s
    roof, an additional light source was required. A 250-watt IR-lamp was used for
    this purpose. Download : Download high-res image (583KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. The measurements were carried out in stationary mode at a distance
    of 2 m from the tomato plants using an IR-lamp as additional spectrum source.
    The portable gas-exchange and fluorescence system GFS-3000 Walz (Fig. 11(a)) measured
    all parameters relevant for plant photosynthesis ( and exchange, and stomatal
    conductance) related to the physiological response affected by decreasing water
    availability. GFS-3000 consists of an open gas pathway, measuring head (Fig. 11(b)),
    and a control unit including an infrared gas analyzer (Fig. 11(c)). The constantly
    pumped air, including in particular and , is divided into measuring and reference
    gas pathways. The leaf sample is placed into the cuvette of the measuring head
    (Fig. 11(b)). The measuring gas flows to the measuring head containing the sample,
    while the reference gas flows directly to the reference side of the analyzer.
    During photosynthesis, the sample takes up . For this purpose, it opens the stomata,
    which leads to a release of . The generated concentration difference in and between
    the measuring gas and the reference gas is used for the calculation of photosynthetic
    assimilation and evaporation of the sample and to observe how the plant reacts
    on water deficit [41]. Download : Download high-res image (946KB) Download : Download

    stress detection using the CWSI were collected by a meteorological station (Fig.
    8). The minimum and maximum leaf temperatures corresponding to the highest and
    lowest transpiration rate were calculated from the environmental parameters using
    the linear equation for (Eq. (10)) and (Eq. (11)). In addition, both parameters
    were controlled by placing the thermocouples on a leaf continuously moist and
    a leaf covered with petroleum jelly. 5. Results and discussion A precise determination
    of an irrigation trigger point is essential for an automated scheduled watering
    system that suits the crop requirements. The PLANTSENS monitoring system measures
    leaf temperature and water absorption concerning environmental conditions to determine
    a switching value (threshold) for the exact irrigation time. Once the stress index
    exceeds the predefined threshold, the impulse activating the watering system is
    triggered. This study presents the results of two measurement sessions from July
    27, 2020 with average low irradiation of and August 7, 2020 with intermediate
    high irradiation of . The constantly changing environmental conditions lead to
    high variations of the measured values. In addition, plants react very dynamically
    to different outdoor conditions, so that their response also affected the measured
    values. Also, the sensors had to be placed at different locations/heights due
    to the growth of the plants. In this research work, the image acquisitions occurred
    every 5 min in order to be able to monitor the progress of the water stress. In
    principle, the frequency of image acquisition depends on the crop size, the movement
    speed of the multi-sensor platform, and the range of irrigation radius. For larger
    crops, a higher sampling rate is not feasible with a single measuring system.
    Image processing has been divided into three main steps as shown in Fig. 12. In
    the first step the NDVI mask is put on thermal and shortwave infrared image to
    extract only the plant pixels. The next step converts measured reflections into
    CWSI and WI values per pixel. Finally, pixel indices are averaged to a single
    value per image and saved in database. Download : Download high-res image (545KB)

    index (Eq. (6)) requires information about the current leaf temperature ( ) and
    the upper ( ) and lower ( ) temperature limit. The canopy temperature has been
    measured using the thermal imaging camera. The temperature boundaries were predicted
    from meteorological conditions collected using wet-blob-globe-temperature based
    on the previously explained regression equations as a function for the maximum
    (Eq. (10)) and for the minimum (Eq. (11)) limit. As shown in Fig. 13, Fig. 14,
    the estimated temperature boundaries provide a suitable corridor for the current
    leaf temperature. The CWSI stays within the valid range between 0 and 1. The closer
    the canopy temperature moves toward the maximum limit, the higher the stress index
    becomes. This correlation can be seen on both plots from July 27, 2020 and August
    7, 2020, starting at 10:30 a.m. and at 11:00 a.m., respectively. Both diagrams
    indicate an upward trend, despite the varying CWSI values. Download : Download

    The water index (WI) combines the reflections of wavelengths at 1450 and 1300
    nm. In these bands water absorption is very high and low, respectively. Due to
    the different intensities of both spectrums, the image data must be measured with
    respect to a reference standard. The WI index is calculated according to the following
    equation: (9) where and refer to the plant leaf reflection at 1300 and 1450 nm,

    Estimating irrigation time Following the previous assumption, the crop should
    be irrigated once the water demand is determined based on the increasing CWSI
    and WI values. However, an increasing tendency indicates water stress but does
    not define the exact irrigation time. For instance, a simple but feasible method
    for specifying the irrigation time by analyzing the slope changes is illustrated
    in Fig. 17, Fig. 18. Here, a time window of 30 min was defined. The slope differences
    of CWSI (blue plot) and WI (orange plot) were calculated with respect to the previous
    values measured 30 min before. Additionally, water vapor conductance ( ) has been
    used to verify the irrigation trigger time. values reflect the physiological response
    of plants to reduced water availability. A significant drop in water vapor conductance
    indicates a water deficit and might correspond to the uptakes in water stress
    of CWSI and WI. An irrigation pulse is generated whenever the predefined limit
    (threshold) is exceeded. Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download :

    Prediction of the irrigation trigger point for tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum),
    shown for August 7, 2020, based on the slopes of calculated CWSI and WI in relation
    to water vapor conductivity ( ). In the diagram from July 27, 2020 (Fig. 17),
    the water vapor conductivity shows a slight drop at 10:30 a.m., decreasing from
    to , which suggests a possible beginning of water stress. This effect is also
    visible in the repeatedly increasing values of the CWSI and WI slopes, resulting
    in a threshold value of 3.0 and 2.2, respectively. In the diagram from August
    7, 2020 (Fig. 18), the CWSI and WI slopes exceed the threshold value of 3.0 at
    11:25 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., indicating a potential onset of water stress. This
    assumption matches the decreasing water vapor conductivity within a half-hour,
    from at 11:30 a.m. to at 12:00 p.m. Hence, both methods give a signal to irrigate
    before the plant starts suffering under water stress. Because the irrigation pulses
    do not align perfectly, it depends on the system configuration whether one or
    both methods are required to activate the irrigation system. The purpose of a
    redundant system is that both methods complement each other. 5.4. System limitations
    Presented remote and non-invasive methods have proved promising in real-time water
    stress detection for tomato plants. However, both measuring techniques involve
    additional effort to be used effectively. Since each plant type reacts slightly
    differently to changing weather conditions, the temperature-based method requires
    further training data first to develop prediction algorithms for maximum and minimum
    leaf temperature. Due to the atmospheric absorption, the absorption-based method
    needs an additional light source as the sunlight reaching the earth''s surface
    does not provide enough intensity of 1450 nm wavelength. Objects like clouds or
    a greenhouse roof decrease the amount of electromagnetic radiation, making this
    measuring technique challenging, especially in an open-field environment without
    perfect weather conditions. One potential solution would be to focus on the absorption
    in the near-infrared spectrum at 970 and 1200 nm, which is significantly lower
    compared to more sensitive shortwave infrared at 1450 nm but less limited by the
    environmental circumstances. Water stress is a significant indicator for irrigation
    scheduling. At the current stage of work, the proposed slope-based method seems
    not to be completely suitable since the threshold value has to be manually determined
    and might variate. Therefore, we see the potential in extending the monitoring
    system with artificial intelligence and improving the decision algorithms. 6.
    Conclusions This research presents the concept of a smart agricultural monitoring
    system for automated plant stress detection and irrigation. The focus of this
    study was on building an autonomous robot for remote sensing of plant leaves and
    developing an analysis method to predict irrigation time using various measuring
    techniques of water stress detection. The prototype of the PLANTSENS system combines
    thermal and multispectral measuring methods based on leaf surface temperature
    and shortwave infrared light absorption. Our results confirm that both methods
    are promising for further development of non-contact water stress detection. Nevertheless,
    it has to be noted that the algorithms have only been trained and tested on tomato
    plants in a closed environment (greenhouse). As a part of the PLANTSENS II project,
    the measurement system will be improved and optimized for use in open-field observations
    with a drone. One modification involves replacing the NVIDIA Jetson Tx2 with the
    Jetson Nano, which has a lower power consumption and two integrated camera serial
    interfaces (CSI), eliminating the need for Raspberry Pi Zero. Another hardware
    limitation is the thermal camera FLIR Vue Pro, which does not support standard
    interfaces for image acquisition. Since images can only be saved on SD Card and
    the camera can only be controlled via pulse width modulation (PWM) signals, it
    requires unconventional solutions to integrate and synchronize the sensor with
    the rest of the system. The FLIR Lepton 3.5 is considered as an alternative due
    to its reduced size, lower power consumption, and multiple standard communication
    interfaces that allow direct data acquisition. In order to focus on multiple stress
    factors, an upgrade to a hyperspectral camera is unavoidable. A multispectral
    camera requires additional filters for capturing a single wavelength, leading
    to further difficulties. In contrast, a hyperspectral camera can slice the spectrum
    into multiple wavelengths enabling more spectral combinations that may be used
    for detecting other stress factors besides water deficit, such as plant diseases.
    Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an important tool in data analysis.
    It can analyze large amounts of data and make more accurate predictions based
    on identified patterns from past observations. Using AI to train algorithms, especially
    for predicting upper and lower temperature limits and estimating the correct irrigation
    time, could result in more informed and efficient decisions, leading to improved
    crop yields and reduced water waste. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

- analysis: 'The paper titled "A review of irrigation monitoring based on Internet
    of Things, remote sensing and artificial intelligence" is somewhat relevant to
    the review point on considerations for data volume, frequency, format, and source.
    The paper provides a broad overview of irrigation monitoring technologies and
    focuses primarily on the types of data collected for irrigation scheduling rather
    than the specific considerations mentioned in the review point.


    While the paper does not directly address data volume, frequency, or format, it
    does mention the sources of data for irrigation monitoring, which is indirectly
    related to these considerations. The authors mention that data can be collected
    from soil moisture sensors, weather stations, evapotranspiration sensors, and
    plant sensors. This information can help researchers and farmers select appropriate
    data sources, which in turn can influence the volume, frequency, and format of
    the data collected.


    Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the current state of irrigation
    monitoring technologies, but it does not directly address the specific considerations
    mentioned in the review point. A relevance score of 0.55 is assigned to the paper.'

  description: As the largest consumer of fresh water, agricultural irrigation, combined
    with climate change and increasing human water use activities around the world,
    has led to a serious water crisis. As a crucial part of irrigation scheduling,
    the monitoring object of precision irrigation will effectively improve the efficiency
    and accuracy in agricultural practice. This paper reviews the main monitoring
    objects used in irrigation scheduling in recent years. From the literature review,
    the monitoring objects are mainly divided into three categories based on soil
    moisture, weather and evapotranspiration, and plants, among which the monitoring
    based on soil moisture is the most common and direct method. At the same time,
    the development and application of Internet of Things(IoT), Wireless Sensor Network(WSN),
    Remote Sensing(RS) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) also provide advanced technical
    means for irrigation monitoring. This review is expected to help researchers and
    farmers select appropriate irrigation monitoring objects, thereby improving the
    effective water use efficiency in irrigation scheduling and reducing the water
    cost for farmers.

    Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT As the largest consumer of fresh
    water, agricultural irrigation, combined with climate change and increasing human
    water use activities around the world, has led to a serious water crisis. As a
    crucial part of irrigation scheduling, the monitoring object of precision irrigation
    will effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy in agricultural practice.
    This paper reviews the main monitoring objects used in irrigation scheduling in
    recent years. From the literature review, the monitoring objects are mainly divided
    into three categories based on soil moisture, weather and evapotranspiration,
    and plants, among which the monitoring based on soil moisture is the most common
    and direct method. At the same time, the development and application of Internet
    of Things(IoT), Wireless Sensor Network(WSN), Remote Sensing(RS) and Artificial
    Intelligence(AI) also provide advanced technical means for irrigation monitoring.
    This review is expected to help researchers and farmers select appropriate irrigation
    monitoring objects, thereby improving the effective water use efficiency in irrigation
    scheduling and reducing the water cost for farmers. References Abioye, Emmanuel

- analysis: 'UAV-based ET mapping incurs a certain extra cost for water managers [51],
    we further asked whether there is a sizeable difference in ET mapped using UAV
    versus satellite imagery. Our result shows that although the median values are
    similar and positively correlated, the Landsat ET and UAV ET vary across the field
    (Figure 7), resulting in a change in the total water budget. We found that the
    total water budget can vary up to 114 m3 (wheat: 114 m3 for an area of 36.45 hectares,
    alfalfa: 78 m3 for an area of 12.96 hectares, corn: 43 m3 for an area of 18.72
    hectares, rye grass: 25 m3 for an area of 5.67 hectares, and peas: 45 m3 for an
    area of 11.7 hectares). Besides, Landsat ET is normally over-predicted around
    bare land areas and under-predicted around the dense vegetation areas compared
    to UAV ET (Figure 4). The reason for this difference is due to the varying sensing
    time and pixel resolution as the various landscapes exhibit varying temperature
    and ET results are influenced by the aggregation [44,45,52]. As ET mapped using
    UAV-based imagery was done at higher spatial resolution, the variability in ET
    captured using UAV imagery is higher compared to Landsat imagery. Thus, the UAV
    approach of ET estimation supersedes the Landsat approach for their application
    in precision agriculture such as identifying ponding locations, identifying water
    stress or overirrigation at the field size, and identifying irrigation system
    malfunctions [46,47,48]. Therefore, our results indicate that this difference
    in ET variability across two sensors warrant the further investment in UAV-based
    image mapping for field scale evaluation.'

  description: Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the water cycle,
    and an accurate prediction of ET is essential for water resource management, irrigation
    scheduling, and agricultural productivity. Traditionally, ET has been estimated
    using satellite-based remote sensing, which provides synoptic coverage but can
    be limited in spatial resolution and accuracy. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
    offer improved ET prediction by providing high-resolution imagery of the Earth’s
    surface but are limited to a small area. Therefore, UAV and satellite images provide
    complementary data, but the integration of these two data for ET prediction has
    received limited attention. This paper presents a method that integrates UAV and
    satellite imagery for improved ET prediction and applies it to five crops (corn,
    rye grass, wheat, and alfalfa) from agricultural fields in the Walla Walla of
    eastern Washington State. We collected UAV and satellite data for five crops and
    used the combination of remote sensing models and statistical techniques to estimate
    ET. We show that UAV-based ET can be integrated with the Landsat-based ET with
    the application of integration factors. Our result shows that the Root Mean Square
    Error (RMSE) of daily ET for corn (Zea mays), rye grass (Lolium perenne), wheat
    (Triticum aestivum), peas (Pisum sativum), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) can be
    improved by the application of the integration factor to the Landsat based ET
    in the range of (35.75–65.52%). We also explore the variability and effect of
    partial cloud on UAV-based ET estimation. Our findings have implications for the
    use of UAVs in water resource management and highlight the importance of considering
    multiple sources of data in ET prediction.

    (ET) is a critical component of the water cycle, and an accurate prediction of
    ET is essential for water resource management, irrigation scheduling, and agricultural

    management 1. Introduction The allocation of water resources at the watershed
    scale is being challenged globally by decreasing supplies and increasing demands
    [1,2,3,4]. Efficient water management is critical for balancing the needs of sustainable
    irrigated agriculture, ecosystem services, and water for future development. Effective
    resource management requires reliable information on water availability and demands,
    especially for irrigated crops that account for nearly 80% of consumptive use
    in agricultural basins [5,6,7]. In these basins, understanding water balances
    requires accurate estimation of consumptive use at the watershed scale. However,
    measurement and prediction of evapotranspiration (ET) at a regional or watershed
    scale is challenging due to its spatial and temporal complexity. Remote sensing
    images have provided a promising source of data for mapping ET over large areas
    in cost-effective ways [8,9,10,11,12] and have been increasingly used for mapping
    ET [13,14,15]. One advantage of remote sensing images is that they do not require
    knowledge of the crop growth stage, as they establish a direct link between surface
    radiances and energy balance components. The critical surface and atmospheric
    variables necessary for simulating surface fluxes and ET, such as land surface
    temperature, vegetation indices, and atmospheric temperature, can be retrieved
    from visible, near infrared, and thermal infrared bands of sensors. However, the
    resolution of ET products derived from satellite images, such as those from Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), may not be sufficient to capture
    the spatial variability of ET due to their lower resolution (~500 m ground pixel
    resolution). Other open-source satellite imagery, such as Landsat and Sentinel,
    have higher resolution (Landsat visible, NIR, SWIR—30 m, thermal—100 m; Sentinel:
    10 m) but have long revisit cycles (e.g., 16 days for Landsat 8). As a result,
    we may miss important crop growth stages and potentially underestimate seasonal
    consumptive use. This gap can be reduced with the availability of Landsat 9 having
    anoverpass of 8 days with Landsat 8. Nevertheless, satellite images can also be
    obscured by cloud cover, therefore, we may still not have a single image even
    in a month. Additionally, there is a tradeoff between scanning swath and pixel
    size, therefore, none of the existing satellite sensors can provide images with
    both high temporal and spatial resolution [16,17]. There is a high demand for
    spatially explicit ET information at a higher spatial resolution, for example
    in precision agriculture [18,19]. With the possibility of frequent flights and
    higher spatial resolution, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) stands out as a promising
    technology for filling this gap of satellite imagery. UAVs equipped with multispectral
    and thermal sensors have become powerful tools for mapping ET from agricultural
    fields as they can produce flights on demand and provide images with higher resolution.
    The ground pixel resolutions for these systems are in the order of 0.02–0.10 m
    for multispectral and 0.4–1.0 m for thermal sensors [20,21]. The development of
    software, for example, Pix4D and Agisoft Metashape, for post-processing has helped
    in the wide application of UAV technology including assessing olive tree crown
    parameters, estimating energy balance components over orchards, corn field testing,
    and mapping surface and direct-root-zone water use [19,22,23,24,25]. However,
    UAV capabilities are limited by their ability to cover only small areas due to
    their limited flying time because of the batteries’ endurance and low consumer-grade
    cameras [26]. Most consumer-grade UAVs are not equipped with a thermal sensor
    which is indispensable for ET estimation using a surface energy balance algorithm
    [27,28]. Even so, they can still collect a large block of images with a centimeter-scale
    spatial resolution and can be useful for mapping important growth stage of crops.
    Therefore, UAV and satellite remote sensing data complement each other. The advantages
    of satellite remote sensing data appear to compensate for the disadvantage of
    the UAV, and vice versa with an opportunity for synergies of these two sources.
    There are some recent studies that have applied the synergy of these two remote
    sensing information sources. For example, Backes and Teferle [21] used UAV imagery
    with satellite imagery for mapping a high accuracy digital elevation model, and
    Gray, et al. [29] used UAV imagery in combination with satellite imagery to assess
    estuarine environments. Similarly, Bhatnagar, et al. [30] used a nested UAV-satellite
    approach to monitor the ecological wetlands. Although there are recent studies
    that attempted to combine Landsat and UAV imagery for better ET estimation [20],
    they did not examine how Landsat ET compares with UAV ET estimations across different
    crops and whether correction is needed for watershed-scale prediction. Since UAV-based
    mapping costs sizeable investment for mapping ET, we need to examine whether UAV-based
    mapping warrants the further investment in it. While UAV-based mapping is good
    for precision agriculture providing the spatially explicit information, watershed-scale
    application needs the information of whether there is a difference in the ET mapped
    using the two sensors at spatial resolution of satellite imagery. Before investing
    time and resource into developing an algorithm for joint analysis of data from
    these two sources, we need information about how these two sources perform in
    terms of mapping ET. Similarly, a lot of literature asserts that UAV’s flexibility
    to fly on cloudy days and the possibility of capturing higher variability of ET
    is the added advantage over similar other remote sensing techniques [31,32]. The
    effects of the cloud-based illumination impact on the ET mapping from agricultural
    fields are not yet well understood. UAV can be flown under the cloud, but the
    changing weather can affect how the sensor interprets data from the ground. Therefore,
    for mapping ET and subsequent integration, understating the effect of clouds on
    UAV-based ET estimation is essential. The objective of this research is to improve
    the watershed scale ET estimation using UAV images in conjunction with Landsat
    images. To achieve this objective, we estimated, compared and developed a method
    for successful integration of ET over agricultural field using Landsat images
    with the image collected by Mica Sense Altum sensor mounted on DJI Matrice 210
    Quadcopter. The differences in ET across sensors are used for calculation of the
    integration factor, which is applied for ET estimation at places when and where
    UAV is not flown. We also assess the effect of cloud on UAV-based ET prediction
    by comparing ET under partial cloud and cloud free conditions. We specifically
    address the following questions: (1) Is there a sizeable difference in ET mapped
    at field scale using UAV-based and satellite-based imagery? (2) Is there a time
    to be careful for taking UAV based imagery (effect of partial cloud)? (3) Is there
    a way to integrate these two sources either spatially or temporally using an integration
    factor? We show that there is a sizeable difference in ET creating a ground for
    further investment in drone-based imagery acquisition and potential for integration
    of two sensors for watershed scale prediction by applying a integration factor.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area This study was conducted in the Walla
    Walla River basin, located in the Pacific Northwestern U.S. It is a bi-state watershed
    in the southeast Washington and northeast Oregon (Figure 1). In Walla Walla, the
    summers are hot and dry (average July maximum temperature of 34 °C and rainfall
    of ~10 mm) while the winters are cold and snowy (average December minimum temperature
    of 0 °C and snowfall of ~68 mm) with variable precipitations in the region ranging
    from 1143 mm/year in mountainous headwaters to 254 mm/year near its confluence
    with the Columbia River. The major crops in the region include alfalfa, corn,
    peas, rye grass, and wheat. Figure 1. Map of the Walla Walla River basin with
    color ramp for elevation. Blue pinpoints indicate the locations of the study area
    while pink pinpoint represents the weather station. Sites 1–5 are located in valley
    Chapel, sites 6 and 7 are located in old highway, and sites 8–10 are located in
    hood road. Table 1 presents the details of experimental field sites along with
    types of crops, irrigation systems, acquisition time of UAV images, Landsat overpass,
    and geolocation of each site. A total of 10 sites were used, mainly located in
    the three regions of Walla Walla that are designated as “old highway”, “valley
    chapel”, and “hood road” (Figure 1, Table 1). We selected five different types
    of crops (corn, rye grass, wheat, and alfalfa) with three irrigation types (center
    pivot, hand line, and wheel line). Table 1. Details of the experimental field
    sites used for mapping UAV imagery with types of crops, irrigation system, acquisition
    time of UAV images, Landsat overpass, and location. The acquisition time of UAV
    images and Landsat overpass are reported in 24-h format Pacific Daylight Saving
    Time (PDT). Sites 1–5 are located in valley Chapel, sites 6 and 7 are located
    in old highway, and sites 8–10 are located in hood road areas in Walla Walla,
    WA. Two UAV acquisitions were performed on Site 3 on 20 June 2022. 2.2. Data 2.2.1.
    Satellite Imagery Table 2 provides detail information about the satellite images
    used with their path and row. We used three Landsat 8 and one Landsat 9 images,
    which were extracted from earth explorer. Table 2. Details of Landsat used in
    this study with their types, path and row ids and selected area cloud cover. 2.2.2.
    UAV Imagery Three field trips were made to Walla Walla covering two growing seasons
    for five crop fields: alfalfa, corn, peas, rye grass, and wheat. We collected
    images of these fields, flying UAV (DJI Matrice 210) equipped with a high-resolution
    multispectral and thermal sensor (MicaSense Altum) on the same days and approximate
    times as the Landsat passes. However, UAV acquired images of 20 June 2022 were
    discarded for comparison and integration as the Landsat image on that day was
    obscured by clouds. The spatial resolution of the UAV-based imagery is variable
    depending upon flying altitude and the spectral bands. For consistency, the UAV
    was flown at an altitude of 70 m resulting in a thermal band resolution of ~0.6
    m and multispectral band resolution ~0.03 m. Raw images were preprocessed using
    Agisoft Metashape software Version 1.8.3. The detailed processes are depicted
    in Figure 2. The images were ortho-rectified and layerstacked to achieve a single
    TIFF file containing blue, green, red, red-edge, infrared, and thermal bands.
    A separate TIFF file was created for the DEM at the same resolution as that of
    the orthomosaic. An orthomosaic image from the Agisoft Metashpae was exported
    at a 0.6-m thermal band resolution aggregating (taking the average) of the multispectral
    values by a factor of 20. Further processing was performed in R, a statistical
    programming language [33]. The orthomosaic image extracted from the Agisoft Metashape
    did not provide the direct surface reflectance values which were converted to
    the surface reflectance by dividing each band by 32,768 [34]. Similarly, the orthomosaic
    thermal data retrieved from Agisoft Metashape was converted to kelvin by dividing
    the orthomosaic thermal band by 100 as instructed in the user guide [35]. Figure
    2. Flowchart showing the process for obtaining layerstacked (blue, green, red,
    near infrared, and thermal bands) UAV imagery. 2.2.3. Weather Data Instantaneous
    (every 15 min) weather data from the Agweathernet station at College Place Walla
    Walla were extracted for the days of the UAV flights and satellite overpasses.
    Table 3 provides the summary of weather data for the study period. Table 3. Average
    daily weather data (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average relative
    humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and solar radiation) on the days of UAV acquisitions
    used in this study. 2.2.4. Elevation Data Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data at
    30-m resolution was obtained from the USGS National Elevation Dataset. We also
    used the DEM created at 0.6 m resolution for the UAV based model. 2.2.5. Land
    Cover Data Land cover data were extracted from USGS National Land Cover Database
    2016 to identify the agricultural land use pixels and pasture land use pixels
    required for this study. 2.3. Co-Registration of the Images Table 4 provides the
    wavelengths of the four spectral bands and thermal band across the UAV (MicaSense
    Altum), and Landsat (OLI) sensors. Table 4 shows similar wavelengths for all the
    bands (blue, green, red, near infrared, and thermal) in the case of both UAV and
    Landsat sensors, allowing us to combine the data. The pixels of the UAV images
    may not be exactly lined up with the satellite imagery. To line up the UAV-based
    pixel imagery with Landsat, co-registration of the images is required. Thus, the
    30-m resolution Landsat images were cropped by the field extent and were downscaled
    (i.e., upsampled) to 0.6-m resolution using a factor of 50. Finally, orthomosaic
    UAV images at ~0.6-m resolution were resampled to the resolution and extent of
    downscaled Landsat images. Table 4. Wavelength across the sensors for multispectral
    (blue, green, red, and near infrared) and thermal band used in this study. UAV

    Imager. 2.4. METRIC Model We applied widely used evapoTranspiration mapping at
    high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model to quantify ET [36,37,38].
    METRIC is an image processing tool for mapping ET as a residual of the energy
    balance at the Earth’s surface. In this model, instantaneous ET is computed by
    dividing the difference of the available energy ( 𝑅 𝑛 − G) and sensible heat flux
    (H) by latent heat of vaporization (λ) as below (Equation (1)). 𝐸𝑇= 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺−𝐻 λ
    (1) where 𝑅 𝑛 is the net radiation (W·m−2), and G is the soil heat flux (W·m−2).
    METRIC requires identification of two anchor pixels (hot and cold) to establish
    a relation between land surface temperature and the difference between radiant
    temperature by fixing the boundary condition for internal calibration. Typically,
    cold conditions correspond to well irrigated fields and hot conditions correspond
    to bare agricultural fields. These two pixels are used as boundary conditions
    to find temperature gradients (dT) at each pixel. Then, dT is used to determine
    the coefficients (i.e., slope and intercept) of a linear relationship between
    dT and land surface temperature (Ts) across the entire image as below (Equation
    (2)). 𝑑𝑇=𝑎𝑇𝑠+𝑏 (2) where a and b are empirical constants and are determined using
    extreme end conditions, i.e., with cold pixel (representing maximum Latent Energy)
    and hot pixel (representing zero Latent Energy). For more details, we refer to
    Allen, et al. [39]. The process of mapping actual ET is almost the same for both
    Landsat and UAV images with the only different equation being the one used for
    albedo calculations. Since detailed processes have been explained in many literatures,
    only the difference in albedo calculations is explained here. UAV data obtained
    with a MicaSense sensor lacks the shortwave band necessary for surface albedo
    estimation, thus we employed Equations (3) and (4) to estimate the surface albedo
    ( ∝ ) using narrow band data as suggested by Brest and Goward [40]. The surface
    albedo for satellite images is expressed as (Equation (3)), ∝=∑( 𝑤 𝑏 ×⍴ 𝑏 ) (3)
    where 𝑤 𝑏 is the weight of each band in the Landsat 8 spectral range, ⍴ 𝑏 is the
    reflectance of each band. Similarly, surface albedo for UAV images is expressed
    as (Equation (4)), ∝=0.526(𝑉𝐼𝑆)+0.362(𝑁𝐼𝑅)+0.112[0.5(𝑁𝐼𝑅)],𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼≥0.25 ∝=0.526(𝑉𝐼𝑆)+0.474(𝑁𝐼𝑅),  𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼<0.25
    (4) where, VIS is the reflectance corresponding to the visible bands, NIR is the
    reflectance of the Near Infrared band of the UAV, and NDVI is the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index computed as (Equation (5)). 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼= 𝑁𝐼𝑅−𝑅 𝑁𝐼𝑅+𝑅 (5) where, NIR
    is the Near Infrared band and R is the Red band. Implementation of the METRIC
    Model The METRIC model for this research was developed using the “Water” package
    available in R [41], a statistical programming language [33]. The Water package
    was initially developed for estimating the ET using Landsat 7 imagery and was
    modified by the developer to estimate Landsat-8 ET. For our work we used this
    package to estimate the ET using Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery. The original
    package was then modified for ET calculation using UAV imagery. Since ET estimation
    using METRIC model is reliant on identification of anchor pixels within an image,
    we captured the images of agricultural fields including boundaries like road and
    bare lands in each flight in order to include anchor pixels within a layerstacked
    image. The anchor pixels were chosen using the Water package’s implementation
    of detecting hot and cold pixels. The package values were then manually checked
    for their locations in expected well-watered plant land and barren ground for
    cold and hot pixels, respectively, using visual inspection as suggested in Molaei,
    et al. [42]. 2.5. Comparison of ET The comparisons between Landsat estimated ET
    and UAV estimated ET were performed for each day of satellite overpass to determine
    the similarity or dissimilarity in daily ET estimation between the sensors. First,
    ET was estimated separately for both UAV and Landsat imagery for the same field
    on the same day using METRIC. Then, Landsat estimated ET was cropped by the extent
    of the field, using the UAV imagery for comparison purposes. Similarly, ET for
    UAV imagery was estimated at a thermal resolution of 0.6 m, which was upscaled
    to a Landsat resolution of 30 m by aggregating (taking the mean value) the UAV
    ET with factor of 50. The pixel-by-pixel comparisons between the ET estimated
    using two sensors were performed at the Landsat resolution of 30 m. The variations
    in the patterns were tested by plotting the two raster images side by side using
    the same color scale for five samples (one for each crop). The statistical comparison
    between the ET were tested using the five statistical measures; the coefficient
    of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
    bias, and median. 2.6. Partial Cloud Effect on UAV-ET To understand the potential
    impact of partial cloud on UAV-based ET prediction, we estimated and compared
    the ET prediction under partial cloud cover and clear sky conditions over site
    3 on 20 June 2022. UAV acquisitions were conducted over the same field at a different
    time of the day with partial cloudy and clear sky conditions over irrigated agricultural
    field. Thus, collected images were used to estimate ET using the METRIC model
    and variations in ET at areas superimposed under cloud and cloud free areas are
    assessed. 2.7. Integration of ET In this study, we propose a method for fusing
    satellite and UAV ET estimates towards the better prediction of watershed-scale
    ET estimates. The method employs both temporal and spatial fusion techniques to
    combine data from the satellite sensor and the UAV using the integration factor.
    The detailed process used for integration of sensors and model evaluations is
    shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Flowchart for the comparison and integration of ET.
    Integrated model ET is the combination of the Landsat and UAV ET. 2.7.1. Temporal
    Integration We used the temporal integration method for correcting the Landsat
    ET estimate on day T2 for the same place/crop using the integration factor calculated
    on day T1. The pixel-by-pixel integration factor (IF) was calculated by taking
    the ratio of UAV-based ET to Landsat-based ET at day T1 (training day) (Equation
    (6)). 𝐼𝐹 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙 = ( 𝑈𝐴𝑉 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑇1 ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑇1 (6) where ( 𝑈𝐴𝑉 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑇1 is
    the UAV estimated ET on day T1 and ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑇1 is the Landsat estimated
    ET on day T1. Then the calculated integration factor was multiplied with Landsat
    ET on day T2 to get the assumed corrected ET (Integrated ET) values on T2 (testing
    day) (Equation (7)). 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇 = ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑇2 × 𝐼𝐹 𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙 (7) where
    𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇 is the corrected combination of Landsat and UAV ET on day T2, and
    ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑇2 is Landsat estimated ET on day T2. For temporal integration,
    the mapping of the same place with the same crop within a growing season was needed
    to see how it performed with the correction factor at different times of the year.
    Since we have these two sets of images only for three crops (alfalfa, peas, and
    rye grass), the temporal integration is performed only on these crops as farmers
    rotated corn and wheat with other crops. The details of the sites and days used
    for integration factor computation and evaluation are provided in Table 5. Evaluation
    of the temporal integration factor application was done using the four statistical
    measures R2, RMSE, MAE, and bias. Table 5. Details of the sites used (three crops)
    for temporal integration factor computation and the testing. Temporal integration
    factor was calculated using the estimated ET on Training day (T1). Integration
    and evaluation was done on Testing day (T2). 2.7.2. Spatial Integration We used
    the spatial integration method for correcting the Landsat ET estimate at the different
    place but on same day/crop using the integration factor. The mean value of the
    pixel-by-pixel integration factor was calculated dividing the UAV ET by the Landsat
    ET (Equation (8)). 𝐼𝐹 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 =𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛( ( 𝑈𝐴𝑉 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑃1 ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑃1 ) (8) where
    ( 𝑈𝐴𝑉 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑃1 is the UAV estimated ET at site P1, ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑃1 is Landsat
    estimated ET at site P1, and 𝐼𝐹 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 is the spatial integration factor. Then
    the calculated mean value of the spatial integration factor was multiplied with
    Landsat ET at the other site (P2) to get the assumed corrected Landsat ET (Integrated
    ET) on same day at P2 (testing site) (Equation (9)). 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇 = ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡
    𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑃2 × 𝐼𝐹 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 (9) where 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇 is the corrected combination of Landsat
    and UAV ET at site P2, and ( 𝐿𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝐸𝑇 ) 𝑃1 is Landsat estimated ET at site P2.
    Table 6 details the crop, sites, and days used for the integration factor computation
    and evaluation. Since R2 values do not alter with the division or multiplication
    by a constant, we evaluated the performance after the application of the spatial
    integration factor using the RMSE, MAE, and bias statistical measures only. Table
    6. Details of the sites (five crops) used for spatial correction factor computation
    (training) and the testing. Spatial integration factor was calculated using the
    estimated ET at Training site (P1). Integration and evaluation was done on Testing
    site (P2). 3. Results 3.1. UAV and Landst Based ET Comparison Figure 4 shows the
    sample mapping of the 24 h ET on five different crops. In line with results from
    previous studies [43,44], we found an overall similar pattern for ET mapped using
    both types of imagery. However, detail comparison shows significant spatial variations
    between barren and highly vegetated areas (Table 7). We found that Landsat consistently
    overpredicted ET in areas that were relatively bare and underpredicted ET in areas
    that were covered in vegetation (Figure 4). Overprediction of Landsat ET in bare
    areas are most noticeable in peas, rye grass, and alfalfa, and underprediction
    in vegetation areas are most noticeable in wheat. One of the reasons for this
    variation might be because of varying temperature as the various landscapes exhibit
    varying temperature differences due to pixel resolution and differing in sensing
    times. Therefore, we checked the difference between the temperature by plotting
    the corresponding normalized thermal histogram (Figure 5). Despite the fact that
    the thermal distribution of both UAV and Landsat is similar (right skewed) for
    all crops, the median value of UAV-based temperature is lower compared to Landsat.
    The variation in median value of temperature is due to the differing time of acquisition
    of UAV and Landsat overpass time (Table 1) as land surface temperature fluctuates
    significantly during the day, reaching its highest point in the middle of the
    afternoon, which might have led to the some noticeable variation in ET [45]. Figure

    five crops: (a) corn (area: 18.72 hectares) on 11 July 2021, (b) peas (area: 11.7
    hectares) on 21 June 2022, (c) rye grass (area: 5.67 hectares) on 11 May 2022,

    temperature respectively. Table 7. Summary statistics of ET on sample five crops
    across UAV and Landsat sensor at Landsat scale. Min, Max, Mean, Sd represents
    the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation of ET on the corresponding
    field. 3.2. Statistical Comparison of Fractional Evapotranspiration (ETrF) While
    comparison of daily evapotranspiration shows how crop ET varies on a particular
    day, the comparison of fractional evapotranspiration (ETrF), which is the ratio
    of actual ET to reference ET, is easier for evaluating how it performs across
    different crops within the same scale. Figure 6 shows scatterplots between sample
    aggregated UAV and Landsat ETrF (one for each crop) whereas Table 8 shows the
    statistical comparison at each overpass date at a 30 m resolution. Overall, we
    found the R2 values in the range of 0.27 to 0.84 comparable with the aggregated
    aerial temperature and Landsat temperature comparison [44]. RMSE and MAE ranged
    from 0.1 to 0.27 and 0.06 to 0.22, respectively. Similarly, the bias ranges from
    −0.21 to 0.2, where the positive bias imply that the ETrF obtained from the Landsat
    images were overestimated, whereas negative bias suggests that the ETrF values
    were underestimated from those obtained from UAV images. Figure 6. Scatterplot
    of Landsat ETrF vs. UAV EtrF on five sample crops used for this study. Each subplots
    represent the scatterplot with the corresponding slope, intercept, coefficient
    of determination, mean absolute error, bias, and root mean square error values.

    Table 8. Statistical measure of the relationship between fractional evapotranspiration
    mapped using the Landsat and UAV imagery at 30 m resolution for each day of Landsat
    overpass on five crops. Evaluated by crop, alfalfa (0.64–0.84), peas (0.49–0.62),
    corn (0.58), rye grass (0.4–0.46), and wheat (0.27–0.68) showed an excellent R2
    (0.4) with the exception of wheat on 21 June 2022. A major factor responsible
    for low R2 values for wheat on 21 June 2022 is the concentration of most of the
    ETrF values in the range of 0.8 to 1.1, with few below 0.8, as it was the peak
    stage of water consumption for wheat, giving higher ET values. This can be further
    verified from the RMSE values, which is just 0.17 in the case of wheat whereas
    RMSE is 0.27 in the case of alfalfa which has the good R2 value of 0.84. Although
    good correlation was found, there is a significant bias (alfalfa: −0.21 to 0.03,
    wheat: 0.05 to 0.1, rye grass: −0.21 to −0.08, peas: −0.17, 0.06, corn: 0.02)
    in the ETrF mapped using UAV and Landsat imagery. The positive biases for wheat
    on 11 July 2021 and 21 June 2022 implies the EtrF values obtained from the Landsat
    images were overestimated, whereas negative biases for rye grass on 11 May, 12
    May, and 21 June 2022 suggests that the temperature values were slightly deviating
    from those obtained from UAV images. We also found that if the UAV technique is
    employed as benchmark, Landsat data exhibit a propensity to exaggerate low values
    and underestimate high values. While the exact cause of this error needs to be
    further investigated, it may be due to the Landsat thermal band’s inferior resolution
    at 100 m. Although this data is processed and reduced to 30 m, the averaging may
    result in ET estimates that were different than the UAV estimates, as land surface
    temperature is a key element in determining ET using METRIC method. For successful
    integration of ET obtained from UAV and Landsat images we need estimation of the
    integration factors. As seen from the Figure 6 (slope and intercept), there are
    unique relationships between the ET mapped using UAV imagery for each crop and
    the ET mapped using Landsat imagery. These findings hint that each crop has a
    distinct connection, and that the integration of the ET mapped using these sensors
    requires distinct integration factors. 3.3. Variability of ETrF The spatial variability
    of ETrF captured by the UAV and Landsat modeling approaches on sample sites are
    shown in Figure 7. As pixel sizes are small for the UAV compared to Landsat, more
    variability is captured. The information regarding variability of water demand
    is crucial for the better management of water in precision agriculture including
    the application of variable irrigation [46,47,48]. From Figure 8 we can infer
    that the median values of fractional ETrF do not show any trend of ET variation.
    Alfalfa and wheat have greater median ETrF values for Landsat, while peas have
    lower values. On maize and rye grass, the median ETrF values predicted by both
    sensors are comparable. The Figure 8 shows much more variability across the field
    on two crops of alfalfa and on rye whereas show less variability in the case of
    peas and wheat. This is because there were constant applications of irrigation
    on alfalfa and rye with some part remaining to irrigate whereas, irrigation was
    just turned off after complete application on wheat and peas. Figure 7. Raster
    plot showing the variability of ETrF being captured by UAV and Landsat on five
    crops: (a) corn (area: 18.72 hectares) on 11 July 2021, (b) peas (11.7 hectares)
    on 21 June 2022, (c) rye grass (5.67 hectares) on 11 May 2022, (d) wheat (36.45
    hectares) on 21 June 2022, and (e) alfalfa (12.96 hectares) on 12 May 2022. Figure
    8. The boxplot showing the variability of ETrF being captured by the two sensors
    for five different crops alfalfa, corn, peas, rye grass, and wheat. 3.4. Partial
    Cloud Effect on UAV-ET Figure 9 below shows the UAV ET mapping for a cornfield
    at site3 on the same day but at different times under partial cloud and cloud
    free conditions. It shows that the predicted evapotranspiration is higher in places
    superimposed by cloud shadows than in other cloud-free places. This is because
    the pixel overlaid over cloud shadows resulted in lesser LST values giving the
    weaker longwave radiation from the ground based on the Stefan-Boltzman equation.
    As a result, in comparison to the pixels in the non-cloudy areas, the net radiation
    (and subsequently the predicted ET) of the pixels overlaid under cloud shadows
    increased more than the ET, which was unexpected. Direct comparison between the
    two images shows that the ET mapped are almost similar in places other than the
    overcast cloud shadows. Therefore, although the UAV can be flown under the cloudy
    conditions, there seems to be a direct influence on the ET estimation that needs
    to be accounted for especially during partly cloudy sampling. Figure 9. (a) METRIC

    Temporal Integration of ET Since 24-h ET estimated by two sensors departs from
    each other, it raises the question of whether ET estimated using these two sensors
    can be combined for time series integration. To answer this question, we compared
    the ET estimated using the UAV imagery with ET estimated using the Landsat imagery
    with and without the application of the integration factor. For time series integration,
    we need to map the same place with the same crop within a growing season to see
    how it behaves at different times of the year. As we have needed two sets of images
    for three crops only, the comparison results presented here are based on these
    three crops. The pixel-by-pixel integration factor was calculated by dividing
    the UAV predicted ETrF by Landsat predicted ETrF on 11 May and 12 May, and thus
    the calculated integration factor was applied to get the corrected ET values on
    21 June of 2022. Interestingly, the integration assessment revealed that the application
    of the integration factor for time series integration depends upon the plant’s
    growth stage and the irrigation water application (Figure 10). This becomes more
    evident from the comparison of relationship of alfalfa and peas, where R2 values
    significantly improve with the application of the integration factor from 0.69
    to 0.78 whereas it decreases in the case of peas from 0.58 to 0.34. One reason
    that leads to such variation between these two crops is that alfalfa was being
    irrigated during both flights, whereas the peas were not irrigated at the first
    image and was irrigated later. This might be also because the METRIC ET at the
    early stage of the crop growth is not good and the integration factor calculated
    using this crop at an early stage might not work for the later stage of the crop.
    Similarly, we can see that there is no variation on R2 for the rye grass with
    and without the application of the correction factor, which might be because this
    field was constantly irrigated and cow calves were constantly grazed, making these
    two situations not ideal. Thus, the application of the correction factor has no
    meaning here. Therefore, based on this result we can infer that for the time series
    integration, the integration factor from one image to another can be done if they
    are in a similar growth stage and have similar irrigation applications. Figure
    10. Change of ETrF with and without the application of the time series integration
    factor on alfalfa, rye grass, and peas. Each subplot represents the scatterplot
    with the corresponding coefficient of determination, mean absolute error, bias,
    and root mean square values. Black line is the line with slope of 1 and red line
    is the line of regression. 3.6. Spatial Integration of ET As temporal integration
    did not show any constant pattern of improvement with the use of integration factors,
    we further examined whether these ET estimates could be integrated spatially by
    the application of integration factors. Since the pixel-by-pixel correlation factor
    cannot be applied for ET computation at other sites as in previous steps, here
    we computed the mean value of the integration factor. Table 9 shows the mean values
    of the integration factor, calculated using these two sensors on all five crops
    on the particular day listed below. The integration factors were found in the
    increasing order from peas, alfalfa, corn, rye grass, and wheat. The highest integration
    factor on wheat might be because the Landsat predicts a relatively low value of
    ET on dense vegetation areas compared to UAV ET. Similarly, the lowest integration
    factor of 0.65 on peas was also because the Landsat predicts relatively high values
    on bare areas compared to UAV ET. The integration factor for alfalfa and peas
    calculated on the same day have different values, based on this result we can
    say that the integration factor is unique for each crop even on a single day.
    Table 9. Spatial integration factors for five crops in the descending order. While
    Figure 11 depicts the comparison raster plot of ET across sensors, Table 10 summarizes
    the change in statistical values with and without the application of integration
    factors on hold out set. Our result shows that the METRIC ET predicted using Landsat
    will be significantly decreased with the application of integration factor RMSE
    (35.75% to 65.52%), MAE (41.99% to 73.81%), bias (49.56% to 85.85%). Evaluated
    by crop, the highest improvements were found in alfalfa with the RMSE (1.22 to
    0.42), MAE (1.15 to 0.3), and bias (−1.15 to 0.16), whereas the lowest improvement
    was found on the corn with RMSE (1.6 to 1.03), MAE (1.3 to 0.76). Since the mean
    value of the correction was applied, this might be because there was less variability
    in ET for alfalfa compared to the corn. Similarly, we found the improvement greater
    than 45% on all RMSE, MAE, and bias values for other crops of rye grass, wheat,
    and peas. Based on the Figure 11 and the Table 10 it is conceivable that the integration
    factor computed at one location for a crop can be applied at the other location
    and this will help in the better prediction of the watershed scale ET. Figure

    mean square error, mean absolute error, and bias) with and without the application
    of integration factor. 4. Discussion 4.1. Comparison of Total ET Integration of
    sensors is a cost-effective way of mapping earth observations with the fusion
    of satellite and UAV images becoming increasingly popular [20,49,50]. A positive
    correlation between Landsat predicted and UAV predicted seasonal ET has been shown
    [19,43]. Since daily ET estimation is critical for effective water management,
    in this study the METRIC model was used for comparing and integrating the daily
    ET. We first demonstrated that Landsat estimated 24 h ET was positively correlated
    with the UAV ET with the coefficient of determination in the range of 0.27–0.84,
    consistent with the literature on seasonal ET comparison [43,44]. In particular,
    the median values of ET for a field was similar (Figure 5), forming the base for
    the integration of sensors. Since UAV-based ET mapping incurs a certain extra
    cost for water managers [51], we further asked whether there is a sizeable difference
    in ET mapped using UAV versus satellite imagery. Our result shows that although
    the median values are similar and positively correlated, the Landsat ET and UAV
    ET vary across the field (Figure 7), resulting in a change in the total water
    budget. We found that the total water budget can vary up to 114 m3 (wheat: 114
    m3 for an area of 36.45 hectares, alfalfa: 78 m3 for an area of 12.96 hectares,
    corn: 43 m3 for an area of 18.72 hectares, rye grass: 25 m3 for an area of 5.67
    hectares, and peas: 45 m3 for an area of 11.7 hectares). Besides, Landsat ET is
    normally over-predicted around bare land areas and under-predicted around the
    dense vegetation areas compared to UAV ET (Figure 4). The reason for this difference
    is due to the varying sensing time and pixel resolution as the various landscapes
    exhibit varying temperature and ET results are influenced by the aggregation [44,45,52].
    As ET mapped using UAV-based imagery was done at higher spatial resolution, the
    variability in ET captured using UAV imagery is higher compared to Landsat imagery.
    Thus, the UAV approach of ET estimation supersedes the Landsat approach for their
    application in precision agriculture such as identifying ponding locations, identifying
    water stress or overirrigation at the field size, and identifying irrigation system
    malfunctions [46,47,48]. Therefore, our results indicate that this difference
    in ET variability across two sensors warrant the further investment in UAV-based
    image mapping for field scale evaluation. 4.2. Cloud Cover Effect We also assessed
    the possible cloud impact on UAV based ET estimation. As illustrated in Figure
    9, additional precautions are needed for ET mapping using UAV imagery as cloud-based
    illumination impedes the ET estimation from the field. Although the UAV can be
    flown under the clouds [46,53], the shadows cast by the clouds appear to have
    a direct influence on ET estimation. The timing for UAV flying to determine the
    ET from the field is thus constrained. Further research and investments are required
    to check whether there is an effect under partial cloud only or when we have full
    cloud conditions. 4.3. Integration of ET We examined if there is a way to combine
    these two sensors for better prediction of ET. Similar to other remote sensing
    integration applications [52,54,55], our spatial integration result shows that
    the Landsat ET can be used in synergy with UAV ET. We found that the RMSE, MAE,
    and bias values are significantly reduced in all crops by the application of the
    integration factor by at least 35.75% (Table 10). This work will not only reduce
    the reliability of people on single satellite-based imagery or UAV-based imagery
    for the computation of the watershed scale ET, but will also significantly reduce
    the operational cost of UAV image acquisition as only fewer flights are needed
    for the computation of the integration factor. Therefore, the computation of an
    integration factor is crucial for the successful integration of these two sensors.
    Once the integration factor is computed it can be applied to the Landsat based
    ET. Additionally, our results provide evidence that ET estimation would benefit
    from the synergy of UAV imagery with Landsat imagery for mapping ET at a watershed
    scale as they can complement each other in their ET prediction. In contrast to
    the spatial integration, temporal integration shows the mix result for UAV ET
    integration with Landsat ET. We computed the integration factor using the image
    collected on May of 2022, which was applied with the image collected on June 2022.
    The purpose was to see if we could apply the same pixel by pixel integration factor
    at a place for a crop within the same growing season as done in other spatiotemporal
    studies [55,56]. We found mixed results in alfalfa, with R2 values significantly
    increased from 0.69 to 0.78 with a small reduction in RMSE and MAE values, whereas
    all R2, RMSE, and MAE values did not improve by using such an integration factor
    on peas and rye grass (Figure 10). This suggests that the pixel by pixel factor
    can only be applied if the crop’s growth stage does not differ a lot and if there
    is similar application of irrigation with less variation in hydrothermal condition
    similar to the study on crop landscape [57,58]. This study is the first step in
    identifying a possible integration factor for the use of Landsat ET in combination
    with UAV ET. The data suggest that with the integration factor Landsat ET can
    be used in synergy with the UAV ET for a better prediction of watershed scale
    ET. Understanding these earlier steps of ET integration provide a novel approach
    in using the satellite of ET with UAV ET, which may ultimately lead to effective
    field and watershed scale water management. This work will reduce people’s reliability
    on a single satellite or UAV-based imagery for the computation of the watershed
    scale ET. It is also conceivable that such a method of integration could work
    in many other crops including annual and perennial crops, as well as for many
    other types of satellite and UAV sensors. Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge
    a number of critical decision-making processes that were considered beyond the
    scope of the current project. UAV-based ET was utilized in this work to correct
    Landsat-based ET, however no ground observations were used to determine the accuracy
    of UAV-based ET because of the lack of Eddy Covariance stations in our study.
    Further, we used the same equations for the broadband albedo estimation from the
    narrow band without considering the crop growth stage. However, as pointed out
    by Bartmiński and Siłuch [52], the surface albedo equation needs adjustment for
    crop growth stage. Besides, the current study was performed on working fields
    (not experimental plots) allowing the farmers to use their own management practice,
    irrigation application, and crop rotation. While this may make the study better
    for real world approximation, it hinders the research as we could not get the
    corn crop in the same field for two consecutive years. Future work could address
    these dimensions, as well as formulating a more complex integration model that
    accounts for the change in crop growth stage and variation across the annual and
    perennial crop. Comparing integrated ET along with UAV and satellite-based ET
    with Eddy Covariance stations could also provide additional insight. 5. Conclusions
    We have estimated and analyzed daily ET values using two different remote sensing
    platforms typically used for earth observations. Pixel-by-pixel comparison suggest
    that the daily ET estimates have varying degrees of coefficient of determination
    in the range of 0.27 to 0.84 depending upon crop types. The UAV-based ET estimates
    exhibit higher variability in ET and can provide real time ET estimation that
    has a heightened interest for routine monitoring of daily ET and surface energy
    fluxes. Thus, UAV-based ET estimates are crucial for the real time ET estimation.
    Moreover, the similarity in the median value of the ET mapped by two sensors and
    the positive correlation suggest that integrating these two methods may provide
    a good earth observation like in similar applications. The initial proof-of-concept
    experiment demonstrates that the combination of these two sensors will improve
    ET prediction and that the errors are greatly reduced when an integration factor
    is applied. The possibility of integrating two sources of ET estimates with the
    application of an integration factor provides the additional justification for
    the investment in UAV based consumptive use measurements and monitoring—a critical
    element for water markets in the western United States. This will help reduce
    costs, as mapping the entire watershed is not required, and for same day mapping
    the integration factor computed at one location can be applied to a similar crop
    within the watershed. Further application of this integration of UAV ET with Landsat
    ET will help better predict watershed scale ET, thereby increasing our understanding
    of demand and availability of water for effective water management. Author Contributions

  title: Integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery with Landsat Imagery for Better
    Watershed Scale ET Prediction
  verbatim_quote1: Our result shows that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of daily
    ET for corn (Zea mays), rye grass (Lolium perenne), wheat (Triticum aestivum),
    peas (Pisum sativum), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) can be improved by the application
    of the integration factor to the Landsat based ET in the range of (35.75–65.52%).
  verbatim_quote2: This work will not only reduce the reliability of people on single
    satellite-based imagery or UAV-based imagery for the computation of the watershed
    scale ET, but will also significantly reduce the operational cost of UAV image
    acquisition as only fewer flights are needed for the computation of the integration
    factor.

- analysis: 'The paper "Estimating irrigation water requirement in rice by integration
    of satellite data and agrometeorological indices in Palakkad, Kerala" addresses
    the considerations of volume, frequency, and source of data for automated irrigation
    management systems. The study utilizes satellite-derived Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) data to estimate crop coefficients and crop evapotranspiration
    for rice, thus providing valuable information for irrigation scheduling.


    The paper makes a substantial contribution to the literature by introducing an
    accurate method for estimating irrigation water requirements at a regional scale.
    It highlights the potential of integrating remote sensing techniques with agrometeorological
    indices for real-time irrigation management.


    However, it has a few limitations. Firstly, the study is limited to one region
    (Palakkad district in Kerala) and one crop (rice). The findings may not be directly
    applicable to other geographic regions or crops. Secondly, the paper does not
    evaluate the real-time performance or implementation of the proposed irrigation
    management system. A practical evaluation would provide valuable insights into
    the system''s effectiveness and challenges in real-world scenarios.


    Relevance: 0.78


    Here are the three most relevant verbatim quotes from the paper:


    "The results revealed that NDVI values have strong relationship with Kc values
    with an R2 value of 0.82. Crop coefficient (Kc) maps developed using satellite
    derived NDVI provided Kc values at a regional scale during different stages of
    crop growth and it helped to estimate crop evapotranspiration with greater accuracy."


    "Based on this crop water demands maps depicting the spatial and temporal distribution
    of irrigation requirement were generated for the whole study area. These maps
    can be used as a tool for the estimation of the crop water requirement of a rice
    field if the geographical coordinates of the location are known."


    "The total crop water requirements estimated during Mundakan season 2020-21 and
    2021-22 in Palakkad district were in the range of 611-976 mm and 560-897 mm respectively.
    Integration of remote sensing & agrometeorological techniques has scope for regional-scale
    crop water requirement estimation in a cost-effective and time-bound manner."'

  description: The sustainability of irrigated agriculture is jeopardized by catastrophic
    climate change, with projected forecasts indicating that by 2025, one out of every
    four people on the planet will be experiencing extreme water scarcity. In this
    context, an attempt was made for scheduling irrigation at a regional scale combining
    satellite data and agrometeorological indices over major rice growing tracts of
    Palakkad district in Kerala. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product
    of MODIS (MOD13Q1) with a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution
    of 250 m was utilized to establish a relationship with crop coefficient (Kc) of
    rice during the Mundakan rice season (September-October to December-January) of
    2020-21 and 2021-22 in 30 ground truth locations. The results revealed that NDVI
    values have strong relationship with Kc values with an R2 value of 0.82. Crop
    coefficient (Kc) maps developed using satellite derived NDVI provided Kc values
    at a regional scale during different stages of crop growth and it helped to estimate
    crop evapotranspiration with greater accuracy. Based on this crop water demands
    maps depicting the spatial and temporal distribution of irrigation requirement
    were generated for the whole study area. These maps can be used as a tool for
    the estimation of the crop water requirement of a rice field if the geographical
    coordinates of the location are known. The total crop water requirements estimated
    during Mundakan season 2020-21 and 2021-22 in Palakkad district were in the range
    of 611-976 mm and 560-897 mm respectively. Integration of remote sensing & agrometeorological
    techniques has scope for regional-scale crop water requirement estimation in a
    cost-effective and time-bound manner.

    Keywords: crop coefficient, crop evapotranspiration, irrigation scheduling, Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index, rice, water requirement Abstract The sustainability
    of irrigated agriculture is jeopardized by catastrophic climate change, with projected
    forecasts indicating that by 2025, one out of every four people on the planet
    will be experiencing extreme water scarcity. In this context, an attempt was made
    for scheduling irrigation at a regional scale combining satellite data and agrometeorological
    indices over major rice growing tracts of Palakkad district in Kerala. Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product of MODIS (MOD13Q1) with a temporal
    resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 250 m was utilized to establish
    a relationship with crop coefficient (Kc) of rice during the mundakan rice season
    of 2020-21 and 2021-22 in 30 ground truth locations. The results revealed that
    NDVI values have strong relationship with Kc values with an R2 value of 0.81.
    Crop coefficient (Kc) maps developed using satellite derived NDVI provided Kc
    values at a regional scale during different stages of crop growth and it helped
    to estimate crop evapotranspiration with greater accuracy. Based on this crop
    water demands maps depicting the spatial and temporal distribution of irrigation
    requirement were generated for the whole study area. These maps can be used as
    a tool for the estimation of the crop water requirement of a rice field if the
    geographical coordinates of the location are known. The total crop water requirements
    estimated during mundakan season 2020-21 and 2021-22 in Palakkad district were
    in the range of 700-975 mm and 560-897 mm respectively. Integration of remote
    sensing & agrometeorological techniques has scope for regional-scale crop water
    requirement estimation in a cost-effective and time-bound manner. References Allen,

  limitations: The study is limited to one region (Palakkad district in Kerala) and
    one crop (rice). The findings may not be directly applicable to other geographic
    regions or crops. Secondly, the paper does not evaluate the real-time performance
    or implementation of the proposed irrigation management system. A practical evaluation
    would provide valuable insights into the system's effectiveness and challenges
    in real-world scenarios.

    and meteorological forcing variables were employed as input variables to TSEB-PT.
    All analyses were conducted at different pixelation of the UAV data to quantify
    the effect of spatial resolution on the performance. The 1 m spatial resolution
    produced the highest correlation between Tr modelled by TSEB-PT and measured by
    sap flow sensors (R2 = 0.80), which was comparable to the 0.06, 0.1, 0.5 and 2

    balanceUnmanned aerial vehicle 1. Introduction Amid the global climate crisis
    due to greenhouse gas emissions, changing patterns in temperature and precipitation,
    and irrigation water overuse (Wada et al., 2010), accurate estimations of surface
    energy fluxes are critical for determining agronomic drought and crop water demand
    in precision agriculture (Kustas and Anderson, 2009). Latent heat flux (LE, W
    m−2), i.e., dissipating heat from the surface to the atmosphere by water evaporation,
    is the key process determining the water balance and the biogeochemical function
    of ecosystems (Mallick et al., 2009). Evapotranspiration (ET; mm), the equivalent
    to LE in terms of rate of water use, transfers water from soil (evaporation, E)
    and plant (transpiration, Tr) as vapor to the atmosphere with a concurrent removal
    of energy from the land surface (Maes and Steppe, 2012). It can be calculated
    by dividing LE with the latent heat of vaporization and density of water. From
    an agro-environmental perspective, ET can be used for scheduling irrigation and
    managing water use. The spatio-temporal distribution of the surface energy balance,
    and hence of ET, remain challenging to estimate due to, among others, variability
    of soil water storage, root depth, plant water status and leaf conductance over
    time, all of which affect ET. Methods are therefore needed to improve the estimation
    of ET and take its subtle spatial variability into account. Eddy covariance flux
    tower is a reliable micro-meteorological tool to measure LE (Fisher et al., 2009,
    Twine et al., 2000), but with obvious shortcomings when retrieving spatial heat
    flux distribution over heterogeneous fields (Yao et al., 2015), in addition to
    being instrumentally expensive and computationally complex. Alternatively, LE
    can be estimated by remote sensing, as the residual of the surface energy balance
    involving net radiation (Rn), sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux (G) assuming
    no other energy terms or apparent heat advection (Hoffmann et al., 2016, Morillas
    et al., 2013); Rn, H and G are calculated from either ground or remote measurements
    alongside local meteorology (Gowda et al., 2008). The two-source energy balance
    (TSEB) model proposed by Norman et al. (1995) and further developed by Kustas
    and Norman (1999) separates the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST)
    into canopy and soil temperatures and compared to a one-source surface heat flux
    (Verhoef et al., 1997), it estimates fluxes more robustly for heterogeneous fields
    under a wider range of environmental conditions (Kustas and Norman, 1999). The
    flux partitioning is based on an iterative process initiated by an estimate of
    a potential (maximal) Tr computed by the Priestley-Taylor approximation (Priestley
    and Taylor, 1972; hence, the abbreviation TSEB-PT). The exchange of heat between
    the two sources (soil and canopy) and the atmosphere is modulated by a series
    of “resistances” (an analogue to the resistances in electrical systems that describe
    how heat and water vapour exchange is enhanced/opposed through the air, due to
    turbulence and atmospheric stability), being dependent on aerodynamic and meteorological
    conditions (Guzinski and Nieto, 2019). Accurate estimation of the fraction of
    green (transpiring) canopy and leaf area index (LAI) is particularly important
    for TSEB-PT to initiate the first guess of potential Tr, therefore, Rn, H and
    G of plant and soil are estimated separately. The TSEB model has been applied
    on data from several common open-access satellites platforms providing thermal
    infrared imagery, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),
    Landsat-8 and Sentinel-3 (Anderson et al., 2011, Anderson et al., 2004, Andreu
    et al., 2018, Guzinski and Nieto, 2019), which typically have relatively coarse
    spatial resolution for agro-environmental studies and hamper precise results at
    sub-field level. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), on the other hand, add value
    in this regard due to the finer spatial resolution of the data they provide and
    thus the possibility to more precisely delineate canopy and soil components, thereby
    reducing the uncertainty of separating signals from mixed pixels (Nieto et al.,
    2019, Wang et al., 2019, Hoffmann et al., 2016). Detecting in-season plant water
    needs requires appropriate spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of the data.
    Diurnal covariation in Rn and G affects the surface energy balance. For instance
    an irrigation or rainfall event reduces LST while increasing E and Tr (Knipper
    et al., 2019). The extent to which irrigation affects the re-partitioning of the
    sensible and the latent heat fluxes during the day remains poorly understood and,
    to our knowledge, diurnal variation of ET for agricultural fields based on TSEB-PT
    and UAV data and potentials have not been described yet. Furthermore, there is
    a lack of knowledge on whether and to what extent UAV-based estimates of ET can
    be applied to define and operationalize irrigation requirements (IRs). The main
    aim of this study was to design a plausible framework for quantifying plant and
    soil energy fluxes based on remotely sensed LST and TSEB-PT. The study was conducted
    in Denmark during July in both 2018 (the European drought and heat wave, thus
    under ideal conditions for studying drought) and 2019, on experimental fields
    cultivated with potato (Solanum tuberosum var. Oleva). Modelling of ET with remote
    sensing over potato fields has not been performed before, as the plant is drought
    and heat sensitive, and thus is usually grown under temperate and non-drought
    stressed conditions (Hijmans, 2003, Zhou et al., 2017, Peng et al., 2021a). Therefore,
    potato may globally be less exposed, but more sensitive to these abiotic stresses
    compared to other crops, such as maize, rice or wheat. The objectives of the study
    were to: i) evaluate the estimated Tr against hourly sap flow measurements and
    quantify the effect of spatial resolution on the quality of the estimated fluxes,
    ii) estimate diurnal ET from UAV LST images based on TSEB-PT modelling with explicit
    spatio-temporal estimation of Tr and E, and evaluate the correlation between Tr
    and plant biophysical variables, and iii) determine water use efficiency (WUE)
    and IR and investigate their accuracy. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study site,
    experimental design and field data collection The detailed workflow of the framework
    for calculating the water fluxes and eventually IR consisted of a field experiment
    and a remote sensing campaign, as shown in Fig. 1. The field experiment was conducted
    in the summers of 2018 and 2019 in central Denmark (56°31′59.6′’N, 9°24′39.4′’E)
    on a coarse sandy soil. The climate is temperate and humid, with moderately warm
    summers, cool to cold winters and low seasonal temperature variation. The weather
    in 2018 was unusually warm and dry, with corresponding mean temperatures and precipitation
    at the experimental site from 1 June to 31 August of 18 °C and 154 mm, compared
    to the respective mean values for the past 15 years of 15 ℃ and 205 mm. The weather
    in 2019 was relatively normal, though wetter, with summer mean temperature and
    precipitation of 17 ℃ and 357 mm, respectively. Meteorological data (air temperature
    and pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, long- and shortwave irradiance) were
    collected from a nearby meteorological station 500 m away from the experimental
    site (56°31′51.75″N, 9°24′40.99″E). Apart from these meteorological parameters,
    dew point was calculated using the “humidity.to.dewpoint” function from the “weathermetrics”
    package (Anderson and Peng, 2012) in R (ver. 3.5.1; R Core Team, 2013). Potato
    was planted in early May in 2018 and 2019. The experiments were conducted with
    a complete randomized block design comprising two factors: irrigation at full,
    deficit and low rates, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates of either full or variable,
    with four replicates. Further details about the field setup are provided in Peng
    et al., 2021a, Peng et al., 2021b. This study focused on two plots (30 × 30 m2)
    of full N fertilization, but contrasting irrigation, i.e., full and low (Fig.
    2), for the period when daily maximum temperature exceeded 20 ℃, which is above
    the 17.2 ℃ cardinal maximum temperature for optimal potato growth (Peng et al.,
    2021a). The study periods including the remote sensing campaign were from 2 to
    24 July in 2018 and 10 to 26 July in 2019. The date interval was weekly to slightly
    flexible (+- few days) depending on the weather forecast when the temperature
    was high, so there was possibility for drought. Download : Download high-res image

    treatments, respectively. Circles and triangles show, respectively, the positions
    of the time domain reflectometers (TDR; Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA)
    used for soil water content (SWC) measurements and sap flow sensors measuring
    plant transpiration. Backgrounds in B and C are RGB images recorded on 24 July
    2018 and 26 July 2019. Legend and scale apply for panels B and C. (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) Soil water content (SWC) was measured weekly by
    time domain reflectometry (TDR-100 box; Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA)
    connected to a handheld computer (Allegro, Juniper Systems, Inc. Logan, Utah,
    USA) for trace interpretation. The TDR probes were installed in the center of
    each plot vertically to 60 cm depth, midway between the top of the ridge and the
    bottom of the furrow, in order to measure root zone SWC (0–60 cm). Details of
    the probe design and TDR-trace interpretation software are given by Thomsen (1994),
    and soil moisture content calculations were made according to Shahnazari et al.
    (2007). The field capacity (FC) was determined as SWC before emergence of the
    potatoes, five days after the soil had been thoroughly wetted by rain and subsequently
    drained off (Hillel, 2003). The soil water deficit (SWD) was calculated as the
    difference between the weekly measured SWC and SWC at FC. The SWD was used to
    schedule irrigation in the fully irrigated treatment whenever 40–50 % of the available
    water capacity (i.e. 25–30 mm) was used. Sap flow data were collected at 10-minute
    intervals by SGA13-WS Dynagage sensors (Dynamax, Houston, Tx, USA) installed on
    four shoots per plot from 6 July to 6 September in 2018 and from 24 July to 11
    August in 2019. The sensors were installed 4 to 8 m from the plots border in order
    to ensure connectivity from multiple plots to a CR1000 data logger (Campbell Scientific,
    Logan, UT, USA) running the Dynamax Flow32A-1 K software. The variance of the
    plant transpiration measured by sap flow sensors was assumed to represent the
    variance of the plot since the management actions (sowing, fertilization, irrigation,
    pests and diseases control) in each treatment plot were applied evenly by machinery.
    In 2018, four additional sensors were installed in the full irrigation plot on
    19 July and another four sensors were installed on 16 July in another low irrigation
    treatment plot (Fig. 2). Other measurements included leaf stomatal conductance
    (gs, mol m−2 s−1) and leaf water potential (LWP, MPa) recorded diurnally. Leaf
    stomatal conductance was measured on both the abaxial and the adaxial surface
    of a fully developed leaf (4th, 5th and 6th leaf counting upwards) on three plants
    per plot using a calibrated leaf porometer (SC-1, Decagon, Pullman, WA, USA).
    LWP was measured on the same leaflet immediately after the gs measurement by enclosing
    it in a plastic bag before cutting the petiole with a razor blade. The leaflet
    inside the plastic bag was quickly enclosed in a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture
    Equipment, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) and slowly pressurized. Equilibrium pressure
    values were noted, when xylem water became visible on the cut end of the petiole,
    which was observed through a binocular microscope. 2.2. Remote sensing data acquisition
    Thermal camera Tau 2 (FLIR, Wilsonville, USA) encompassing a single 7.5–13.5 µm
    broadband channel with 19 mm focal length was mounted on a quadcopter UAV (Matrice
    100 DJI, Shenzhen, China) to collect LST on 2, 12, 19 and 24 July 2018, and 10
    and 26 July 2019, between 10:00 to 16:00 local time at approximately 30-minute
    intervals, determined by battery capacity and recharging speed (Table 1). The
    UAV was flown 60 m above ground level after a series of test flights to optimize
    fine spatial and temporal resolution, at a speed of 5.8 m s−1 and controlled by
    Pix4D software on a mobile device. The thermal data were obtained and saved as
    video, and images were extracted from the video frame by ThermoViewer (ThermalCapture,
    Wilnsdorf, Germany; ver. 2.1.7) and mosaicked by Agisoft Metashape (ver. 1.6.4;
    Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia). Four plates with shades from white to black
    were scanned before and after each flight by the thermal sensor and temperatures
    were measured by a hand-held infrared thermometer (Optris MS LT, Optris, Berlin,
    Germany) for radiometric calibration. Every day before the first UAV flight, the
    panels were placed on the ground for approximately 30 min to stabilize the temperature
    to an equilibrium status. An RGB camera Zenmuse X3 was also concurrently used
    and these images were processed by Pix4Dmapper (Pix4D S.A., Prilly, Switzerland;
    version 4.2.27) with the “Ag RGB” template. Digital elevation (DEM) and surface
    models (DSM) were also produced from RGB image processing. All UAV mosaics were
    geo-referenced and collocated by four to six ground control points placed at the
    corners of the study area, and resampled to 6-cm spatial resolution. Furthermore,
    TSEB-PT, originally developed for satellite thermal data, requires certain spatialization
    of the input data in order to partition the energy fluxes from mixed pixels to
    canopy and soil components (Norman et al., 1995). For UAV data typically obtained
    at different and very fine spatial resolution (e.g., a few cm or less), the user
    needs to resample the original UAV images to run TSEB-PT (Nieto et al., 2019,
    Xia et al., 2016); however, the effect of spatial resolution on the TSEB-PT canopy
    and soil partitions of energy fluxes remains unclear. Optimal spatial resolution
    also minimizes information redundancy and computational resources. Therefore,
    the UAV images were resampled by averaging to 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2–24 m (with 2-m
    increments) to explore the performance of TSEB-PT modelling at different spatial
    resolutions, and the spatial resolution with the most optimal performance would
    be used for further analysis. Table 1. Available land surface temperature (LST)

    UAV (Matrice 100 DJI, Shenzhen, China) flight campaign with mounted RedEdge (Micasense,
    Seattle, USA) camera collected multispectral imagery at blue, green, red, red
    edge and near infrared bands. Details regarding the multispectral data collection
    are described in Peng et al. (2021a). 2.3. Modelling evapotranspiration by two-source
    energy balance Evapotranspiration was estimated for each flight (Table 1) using
    TSEB-PT. The “series” over “parallel” version of TSEB was employed in this work
    as it was expected that the canopy and the soil interact with each other with
    heat and water exchange, especially under dense-canopy conditions (Nieto et al.,
    2019). The model considers that Rn equals the sum of H, LE and G (Eq. (1) and
    thus neglects heat advection and other fluxes such as heat storage by the canopy
    layer. Rn and the turbulent fluxes are further partitioned between canopy and
    soil (Eqs. 2–5): (1) R n = H + L E + G (2) R nC = H C + LE C (3) R nS = H S +
    LE S + G (4) H = H C + H S (5) LE = LE C + LE S where subscripts “C” and “S” denote
    canopy and soil, respectively. In Eqs. 1–5, Rn and H can be estimated for canopy
    and soil by combining multispectral and thermal data with meteorological forcing
    in a series of equations, as explained below, and LE is calculated as the residual
    of Eqs. 1–5. The LST images containing mixed pixels were partitioned to canopy
    (TC) and soil (TS) temperature using a weighted mean of emitted blackbody radiance:
    (6) σ T rad 4 θ o = f C ( θ o ) σ T C 4 + [ 1 - f C ( θ o ) ] σ T S 4 where T
    rad 4 θ o is radiometric temperature, and it is mixed (canopy and soil) LST in
    this paper, σ is the Stefan-Boltzman constant (5.67037 × 10-8 W m−2 K−4), fc(
    θ o ) = 1 - exp(-κbeΩ( θ o )LAI) is the fraction of vegetation observed by the
    thermal sensor looking at θ o view (observation) zenith angle with κbe beam extinction
    coefficient and Ω( θ o ) canopy clumping index. κbe is given as (Campbell and
    Norman, 2012) k be = x 2 + tan θ s 2 x + 1.774 ( x + 1.182 ) - 0.733 , where x
    is the ratio of average projected areas of canopy elements on horizontal and vertical
    surfaces and it is set to 2.085 for potato according to Campbell and Norman (2012),
    and θ s is sun zenith angle at the time of the flights, calculated by the “Zenith”
    function from the R package “GeoLight” (Lisovski et al., 2015) given latitude,
    longitude and UAV flight time in UTC format. Ω( θ o ) is calculated as: Ω ( θ
    o ) = Ω ( 0 ) Ω 0 + 1 - Ω ( 0 ) e - 2.2 θ 3.8 - 0.46 D hw , where D hw is the
    ratio of vegetation height to width, which was set as 1.25 according to field
    observation, and Ω ( 0 ) is the clumping factor when the canopy is viewed at nadir
    and is given as Ω ( 0 ) = - ln f C e - k be L A I + ( 1 - f C ) k be L A I , where
    fC is the fraction of vegetation canopy cover (Kustas and Norman, 1999). The TC
    and TS from Eq. (6) can be used to estimate HC and HS: (7) H C = ρ C P T C - T
    AC r X (8) H S = ρ C P T S - T AC r S where HC and HS are sensible heat fluxes
    of canopy and soil, respectively. rX and rS are, respectively, the canopy and
    soil resistances to heat transport, ρ is air density and CP is the heat capacity
    of air. TAC is the aerodynamic temperature (air temperature at the canopy source-sink
    height) calculated by temperatures and resistances: (9) T AC = T A r A + T S r
    S + T C r X 1 r A + 1 r S + 1 r X where TA is air temperature measured by the
    meteorological station, rA is the surface aerodynamic resistance to heat transport.
    The equations for rA, rX and rS are listed in Appendix A and can be found in Kustas
    et al. (1999). Since only Trad( θ o ) in Eq. (4) can be obtained from the LST
    images and both of TC and TS are unknown, Norman et al. (1995) described an iterative
    process to derive these temperatures, using an initial guess of TC and consequent
    estimation of canopy latent heat flux based on the Priestley-Taylor equation:
    (10) LE C = α PT f g Δ Δ + γ R nC where αPT is the Priestley-Taylor coefficient
    initially set to its original value of 1.26, fg is fraction of LAI that is green
    and thus photosynthetically active (defined as 1 in this work observing that the
    whole potato canopy was green during this growing period in July), Δ is the slope
    of saturation vapor pressure with temperature and γ is the psychometric constant.
    At this stage, the initial LES estimate is likely to yield negative-unrealistic
    values at daytime indicating dew condensation at the soil surface, which is unlikely
    during daytime. TSEB-PT then iteratively reduces αPT in Eq. (10) and re-computes
    all temperatures and fluxes until realistic LES and LEC are obtained (i.e. null
    or positive). Further details of the iterative process are shown in Appendix B.
    Noteworthy is that Rn for canopy (RnC) and soil (RnS) are based on meteorological
    and remote sensing data (thermal and multispectral) and both can be divided into
    longwave and shortwave parts. The calculation are listed in Eqs. C1-8 based on
    Campbell and Norman (2012). The other equations for radiation calculations are
    listed in Appendix C. The calculated LES and LEC were further converted to E and
    Tr, respectively, and LE was calculated as the sum of LES and LEC and was further
    converted to ET. More detailed information on TSEB-PT can be found in Norman et
    al., 1995, Kustas and Norman, 1999, and Nieto et al. (2019), and the programming
    code is available online at https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.594732).
    TSEB-PT returns instantaneous canopy and soil fluxes at each UAV flight time.
    Assuming that LE is consistently proportional to irradiance (Cammalleri et al.,
    2014, Nassar et al., 2021), daily LE was extrapolated by multiplying the instantaneous
    LE (at or near to noon) with the ratio of mean daily solar irradiance to instantaneous
    irradiance at the UAV flight time, and then converted to daily ET. The biophysical
    parameters needed to run TSEB-PT were obtained as follows. fC used as a proxy
    for canopy clumpiness was derived by first creating an RGB-based vegetation binary
    mask image at 2-cm spatial resolution from the greenness index (GI, 2 × green–red-blue).
    A value of 1 in the mask was assigned when the GI value was above a threshold
    determined by visual interpretation, and 0 otherwise (Zhou et al., 2018, Peng
    et al., 2021a). Then fC at the LST imagery spatial resolution (6 cm) was obtained
    by average aggregating the binary mask. The clumping index (Ω(θs)) used for Rn
    estimation was calculated assuming potato is a row crop with row direction set
    at 330° (see Fig. 2; Colaizzi et al., 2012, Parry et al., 2019) and its calculation
    is shown in Appendix B1 from Nieto et al. (2019). The effective leaf width was
    0.05 m as an observed mean size of the potato leaflets. The height of the canopy
    (hC) was calculated as a difference between instantaneous RGB digital surface
    and elevation models calculated before plant emergence. Finally, LAI was calculated
    according to Campbell and Norman (2012): (11) LAI = - 2 c o s θ s l n 1 - f Ipar
    where f Ipar is the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation
    calculated by a power model f Ipar = a + b RVI c where RVI is the ratio vegetation
    index, (ratio of reflectance in the near-infra red (NIR) to the red spectrum),
    and a, b and c are local empirical coefficients derived with the iterative procedure
    of Christensen and Goudriaan (1993). The reflectance data were obtained by a RedEdge
    camera mounted on UAV in a parallel flight campaign (Peng et al., 2021a). 2.4.
    Calibrating sap flow measurements against soil water balance The 10-minute intervals
    sap flow measurements were quality controlled as prescribed in the equipment manual
    (Dynamax, Houston, Texas, USA) and gap-filled by linear interpolation. Sap flow
    sensors measure the xylem water transport and hence Tr, in unit of ml h−1. The
    method, however, provides widely variable values between shoot due to different
    size and exposure of the selected shoots and a method is needed to scale the values
    from the individual shoots to express them in mm h−1 and be able to compare the
    reading to the TSEB-PT outputs. Sap flow data (ml h−1) covering exactly the period
    between two TDR measurements (up to exact time at 10-minute resolutions) were
    summed (ml) and used to divide the corresponding ET calculated from a standard
    water balance for the week (mm), that is to say, ETswb = ΔSWD + I + P - D, where
    ETswb is ET estimated from soil water balance, ΔSWD is the change or increase
    in soil water deficit, I is irrigation, P is precipitation and D is drainage during
    a period between two TDR soil water measurements, and we assumed the xylem water
    transport summed over the same period is proportional to ETswb. Potential ET (ETP)
    was calculated with the FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998) and
    a mid-season crop coefficient of 1.15. Weeks were selected where the accumulated
    ETP was higher than the sum of SWD, irrigation and precipitation (SWD + I + P)
    during the week indicating negligible drainage and hence the water was transported
    only by ET. Thereby, a ‘calibration constant’ for each sap flow sensor was obtained
    allowing estimation of 10-minute recording values, which we denote as TrSap in
    the unit of mm h−1 from the sap flow measurements (Razzaghi et al., 2012). It
    was assumed that ETswb based on soil water measured in the 0–60 cm soil layer
    was predominantly utilized by the plants for Tr during these periods where the
    soil was relatively dry. Once a shallow surface layer has become dry, E is limited
    in coarse sandy soils (Wang, 2015). 2.5. Empirical calculations and statistics
    Crop water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as: (12) WUE = NPP ET C where ETC
    (mm d-1) is actual ET modelled by TSEB-PT and NPP (g m−2 d-1) is net primary production
    estimated according to Peng et al. (2021a): (13) NPP = RUE opt I p a r f Tmax
    ( 1 - μ f CI ) where RUEopt is radiation use efficiency optimized to 4.19 g MJ−1,
    Ipar (MJ m−2 d-1) is intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and it was
    calculated by multiplying fIpar with half the measured global radiation, and fTmax
    and fCI are environmental constraints for, respectively, daily maximum temperature
    and cloudiness (expressed by cloudiness index, CI), ranging from 0 to 1 and aiming
    to adjust plant production for abiotic factors and μ is a constant (0.46). The
    equations for fTmax and fCI calculation are shown in Table 4 in Peng et al. (2021a).
    Daily irrigation requirement (IR) was calculated as: (14) IR = ET P - ET C I E
    where IE is irrigation efficiency defined as the ratio of applied volume of water
    to volume delivered to the surface of the field and set to 0.9 – a value combining
    sprinkler and gun irrigation applied in this study (Olesen and Plauborg, 1995,
    Thysen and Detlefsen, 2006). The treatment plots were used as the area of interest
    to extract weighted mean values of modelled Tr and ET, using the “extract” function
    from the “raster” package (Robert et al., 2012) in R. The modelled Tr was correlated
    with the sap flow data and the fit evaluated by coefficient of determination (R2),
    root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias. The strength of the correlations
    between gs and LWP with the modelled Tr were evaluated by R2 as well. (15) R 2
    = ∑ i = 1 n Mod i - Mod ¯ Obs i - Obs ¯ 2 ∑ i = 1 n Mod i - Mod ¯ 2 ∑ i = 1 n
    Obs i - Obs ¯ 2 (16) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 n Obs i - Mod i 2 n (17) Bias = ∑ i = 1 n
    Obs i - Mod i n where Obs i and Mod i are observed and modelled values, respectively,
    and Obs ¯ and Mod ¯ are corresponding mean observed and modelled values, n is
    the total number of observations. Since the sap flow data were processed for unit
    conversion based on the soil water balance, the comparison was also conducted
    with the modelled ET in order to assess how well the integrative process of Tr
    and E is reflected by the modelled ET. A spatial sensitivity test was conducted
    to investigate the effect of data spatial resolution on the performance of the
    TSEB-PT by resampling the input data of LST, fC, LAI, and hC from the original
    0.06 to 0.1, 0.5 and 1 m, and further from 2 to 24 m (with 2-m increments) and
    modelled variables (Tr and ET) were compared with the measured ones (sap flow
    measurements) using R2 and RMSE. 3. Results 3.1. Model validation and effect of
    spatial resolution The spatial sensitivity test (linear regression between the
    Tr estimated from UAV images by TSEB-PT modelling at multiple spatial resolution
    and from sap flow measurements) showed that the TSEB-PT model performance varied
    in relation to the spatial resolution of the input data (0.06 to 24 m; Fig. 3).
    From 0.06 to 10 m, R2 and RMSE values ranged from 0.60 to 0.80 and 0.055–0.075
    mm h−1, respectively. With highest R2 and lowest RMSE, 1 m was the optimal spatial
    resolution for modelling Tr and ET using TSEB-PT with UAV data. From 12 m resolution,
    the model accuracy showed oscillating variation, indicating unstable modelling
    performance between 12 and 24 m resolutions. Spatial resolutions finer than 1
    m (0.06, 0.1 and 0.5 m) were also investigated and here the model accuracy was
    slightly lower than that at 1 m, according to R2 and RMSE values (Fig. 3). The
    linear regression analyses were also conducted for ET (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary
    material), and these results also identified 1 m as the optimal spatial resolution
    for energy flux modelling with TSEB-PT and UAV thermal data. Download : Download

    between the transpiration (Tr) estimated from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images
    by TSEB-PT at multiple spatial resolution and from calibrated sap flow measurements.
    The correlations between Tr (and ET) modelled by TSEB-PT based on the UAV data
    at 1-m spatial resolution vs. the sap flow measurements are illustrated in Fig.
    4. The Tr was in close agreement with the sap flow values (regression equation
    y = x-0.007), with a high R2 value (0.80), and low RMSE (0.055 mm h−1) and bias
    (-0.01 mm h−1; Fig. 4 A). However, TSEB-PT showed a slight underestimation for
    the low values (mainly in the low irrigation treatment), which indicates difficulties
    to accurately estimate the low levels of Tr observed by the sap flow equipment
    under drought (e.g., 0.02 mm h−1). In contrast, the modelled ET was overall 20%
    higher than the sap flow values, with low R2 (0.56) and high RMSE (0.15 mm h−1)
    and bias (0.09 mm h−1; Fig. 4 B). Download : Download high-res image (290KB) Download

    3.2. Diurnal variation of evapotranspiration The diurnal dynamics of the modelled
    Tr and ET of potato based on 1 m spatial resolution UAV LST data under full irrigation
    conditions are shown in Fig. 5. Less precipitation (11.2 mm, see Table S1 in the
    Supplementary material) during the UAV campaigns in 2018 (02–26 July) contributed
    to drought stress, compared to the same period in 2019 (41.1 mm). The estimated
    Tr followed TrSap and the diurnal variations of Tr and ET followed the pattern
    of ETP for the fully irrigated plot. In most cases, the soil E flux contributed
    notably to ET (especially, on 2 July 2018 and 26 July 2019; Fig. 5). Moreover,
    at certain instances (e.g., 11:00 on 2 July and 12:00 on 19 July in 2018), modelled
    ET values were higher than ETP due to high Tr and E. One reason for this overestimation
    is overestimated modelled Tr (e.g., being 0.12 mm h−1 higher than the sap flow
    value at 12:00 on 19 July 2018) derived from relatively low LST compared to other
    times on the same day. Another likely reason would be the ample water supply from
    the irrigation and the high-energy input from the solar radiation (at noon). Download

    in the figure as well. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this
    figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Under
    low irrigation, the modelled Tr at 1 m spatial resolution closely followed the
    TrSap, and both were overall close to ET due to the low E (Fig. 6). On a few occasions
    (e.g., 19 July 2018 and 10 July 2019), drought was alleviated by a small amount
    of precipitation and dewfall (a day or two earlier), which also lowered temperature
    (see precipitation data in Table S1 and diurnal variation of dew point in Fig.
    S1 from Supplementary material). The TrSap from the low irrigation on 24 July
    2018 did not follow the dynamics of ETP and were close to zero. For the other
    days, TrSap followed the dynamics of ETP during the early morning, but soon started
    to deviate with an offset due to root zone soil water depletion. Download : Download

    It can be seen on Fig. 7B that a cluster of points opposing the exponential trend
    as these data were from the low irrigation treatment on 19th July 2018 at 12:00–14:00,
    when the drought stress was not high compared to the other days due to the relatively
    low TA and Rn (Fig. 6), hence gs was considerable. However, in the low irrigation
    plot, the canopy cover was not as high as the full irrigation plot, which likely
    exposed the soil (see Fig. 2 B); thus it was likely that part of the water in
    the soil obtained from the irrigation (17th July 2018, see Supplementary material)
    and dewfall was evaporated and Tr was not very high. 3.4. Water use efficiency
    and irrigation demand A CASA model with radiation use efficiency depending on
    maximum daily temperature but not soil or plant water status (Peng et al., 2021a)
    was used together with the TSEB-PT ET estimates. This allowed visualization of
    the spatio-temporal variation of ET, NPP, WUE and IR, as illustrated in Fig. 8
    for two plots with contrasting irrigation treatments. The spatial distribution
    of ET and NPP corresponded well with each other, showing higher ET and NPP with
    full irrigation and vice versa in most of the cases. However, there were exceptions
    when there was heat stress. For example, on 12 and 24 July 2018 and 26 July 2019,
    the daily NPP was zero even for the fully irrigated plot due to heat stress halting
    the growth (daily maximum air temperature exceeded 29 ℃ according to Peng et al.
    (2021a)). Accordingly, WUE was low and independent of ET level. On other days
    its spatial distribution depended on the drought conditions. On 19 July 2018 and
    10 July 2019 the spatial pattern of WUE followed that of NPP and ET as there was
    little or no drought stress. However, on 02 July 2018, an increase of WUE in the
    drought stressed plot was revealed despite NPP being lower than in the fully irrigated
    plot. The spatial patterns of IR (determined by Eq. (14)) corresponded inversely
    to ET (Fig. 8), showing a close relationship between them. According to the distributions
    of IR, there was very little or no need for additional irrigation in the fully
    irrigated plot, even under widespread drought conditions (24 July 2018 and 26
    July 2019), whereas for the low irrigation plot, the calculated IR ranged from
    3 to 6 mm d-1, which corresponded well with the real irrigation amounts applied
    to the fully irrigated plot (around 30 mm per week, see Table S1 in Supplementary
    material) indicating reliability of the IR calculation. Download : Download high-res

    low irrigation.). 4. Discussion 4.1. Modelling evapotranspiration with a two-source
    energy balance model The TSEB-PT modelled Tr at 1-m spatial resolution was in
    excellent agreement with the sap flow measurements (Fig. 4A), which provides the
    evidence that the assumption that the majority part of SWC (used for sap flow
    measurements calibration) detected by TDR sensor in the 0–60 cm soil layer was
    predominantly utilized by the plants for Tr and not by the soil for E. The reason
    is that in coarse sandy soil, only the water retained in the few centimeter surface
    layer will be evaporated and water below surface layer is either leached to deeper
    layer or used by plant Tr (Wang, 2015); under drought conditions, this part E
    can be neglected in the soil water balance model used for sap flow measurements
    calibration. However, this does not mean that there was no E in the field since
    the deviation of ET compared to Tr (Fig. 4) showed there was notable E. It is
    because if there was extra water source, i.e. from irrigation, the water kept
    by the surface soil layer would be evaporated soon under drought conditions and
    the weekly measured TDR sensors were likely less sensitive to this water movement.
    Furthermore, modelled Tr correlated closely to field measurements of LWP and gs
    (Fig. 7). The relationship between gs and Tr was described with an exponential
    regression model (performing more accurately than linear), likely due to the influence
    of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on both Tr rate and gs: Tr ∼ gs × VPD with gs
    being also sensitive to VPD (Grossiord et al., 2020, Leuning et al., 1995, Zhang
    et al., 2022). The high ET in the fully irrigated area indicated that the crops
    transported water from the soil towards the leaves and stomata, inducing a cooling
    effect that was most pronounced at noon (Fig. 8), alleviating drought stress,
    and at the same time lessening otherwise severe and confounded heat stress (Blum,
    2009, Yoo et al., 2009). The low ET in the low irrigation plot (almost 0 at noon,
    especially on 12 and 24 July 2018; Fig. 6) showed that the plants closed the stomata
    to reduce water loss and avoid cavitation in the xylem, but at the expense of
    inflicted heat stress (Teskey et al., 2015) that may severely limit NPP in potatoes
    even at moderate temperatures (Peng et al., 2021a, Zhou et al., 2017). Furthermore,
    E under low irrigation was limited (especially on drought days) due to the combined
    effects of limited SWC and lack of water transport in the sandy soil’s surface
    layer. Therefore, most of the irradiance transferred to the soil is converted
    into sensible heat flux, which is the reason why LST of the soil for the low irrigation
    area was high – typically above 45℃ from 12:00–15:00 versus around 25℃ in the
    fully irrigated. After wetting by rain or irrigation, this top layer is characterized
    by fast drying that breaks the hydraulic contact with the subsoil, thus reducing
    E (Wang, 2015). However, under full irrigation and except for a few points with
    low ETp, there was considerable E (Fig. 5) even under high canopy cover (more
    than 90%; Fig. 2 B). This is likely due to small patches with bare soil exposed
    to sunlight (e.g., sampled place, furrow, machinery track), which were wet due
    to irrigation and thus contributing to soil latent heat flux and E. The plant
    canopy is a porous medium (not solid sheets, but loosely stacked leaf layers)
    with small gaps from which radiation can penetrate as un-intercepted direct and
    diffuse irradiance (Pallardy, 2008) but can also be transmitted and scattered
    by the leaves (Fitter and Hay, 2002). For the same field experiment, the fraction
    of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIpar; visible spectrum) estimated
    from UAV multispectral data from the full irrigation plot reached 0.8–0.98 in
    July 2018 and 0.88–0.91 in 2019 (Peng et al., 2021a). This result indicated that
    some PAR reached the soil despite high canopy cover. For solar radiation other
    than PAR (infrared from 700 to 4000 nm accounting for slightly more than 50% of
    the incoming radiation; Bhatia, 2014), a larger part is transmitted through the
    canopy to the ground surface due to the spectral/structural properties of leaves
    and stems (Campbell and Norman, 2012), which may contribute to E as well. On the
    other hand, part of E may also originate from canopy dew and intercepted irrigation
    water, e.g., on 2 and 12 July 2018, in the low irrigation plot, the water source
    for the notable ET at 10:30 was likely from dew (Fig. S1 & Fig. 6). Fig.S1 shows
    that during morning (00:00–07:00) on all six days, the relative humidity was high
    (close to 100%) and the air temperature was very close to the dew point, which
    indicated that dewfall occurred. This phenomenon (enhanced E from dewfall on both
    leaves and soil) points to a limitation of TSEB-PT (and other comparable energy-balance
    models) in its inability to account for this additional heat/water source. It
    was expected that the sap flow measurements calibrated against changes in SWC
    would correlate better with modelled ET than Tr and part of this discrepancy (Fig.
    6) may be explained by the inability of the model to take proper account of wetting
    of the leaves and soil surface by dew. The TSEB-PT model was originally developed
    and tested for semiarid and subhumid areas, which are relatively different compared
    to higher latitude areas e.g. Scandinavian countries (Kustas and Norman, 1999,
    Norman et al., 1995). This indicated that for the application of the TSEB-PT model
    in higher latitude areas, the model should be modified for the local environmental
    conditions e.g. by including an interception reservoir to achieve higher model
    accuracy. Low Tr and ET values under full irrigation do not necessarily imply
    drought stress (e.g., 15:00 on 12 July 2018; Fig. 5), but might be a consequence
    of low irradiance due to clouds, aerosols and atmospheric water vapor, all of
    which reduce atmospheric transmittance (Lee et al., 2009, Li et al., 2017, Pérez
    and Coma, 2018). The good agreement between the modelled Tr and the sap flow data
    revealed little effect of such conditions on the results since clouds or aerosol
    lowered ETP and sap flow, but also LST, resulting in proportionally lower Tr and
    ET values modelled by TSEB-PT. Similar results were reported by Hoffmann et al.
    (2016). However, it should be emphasized that LST data should ideally be obtained
    under conditions of stable irradiance without scattered clouds, as the cloudiness
    can lead to rapidly changing irradiance, hence a large, induced variability of
    LST during a UAV flight. Regarding the daily LE and ET calculations, it was assumed
    that the ratio of LE over irradiance is preserved during daytime. This simple
    approach has been evaluated in previous studies showing its adequate performance
    with instantaneous LE estimations around noon (Cammalleri et al., 2014). However
    it is a not a perfect method to capture the diurnal variation in severely stressed
    crops (Antoniuk et al., 2021) and additional uncertainties raise when this method
    is applied later in the afternoon (Nassar et al., 2021). 4.2. The use of UAV data
    for modelling evapotranspiration with high spatio-temporal resolution Thermal
    data obtained by UAVs appear to have potential for application and validation
    of land-surface models at high spatio-temporal resolution with their merits over
    heterogeneous landscapes yet to be revealed. Spatial resolutions finer than 1
    m, i.e., 0.06, 0.1 and 0.5 m, were investigated and the model accuracy was slightly
    lower (Fig. 3). The likely reason being that, as with many other energy flux models,
    TSEB-PT radiation and turbulent transport simulations require some degree of spatial
    aggregation in order to comply with the assumption of effective radiative transfer
    and turbulent mixing (Burchard-Levine et al., 2021, Nieto et al., 2019). Exploring
    the spatial resolution effects on the TSEB-PT modelling through images acquired
    at different UAV flight altitudes is difficult as different flight times sense
    variable LST over the flights, resulting in non-comparable data. In addition,
    higher altitudes (>100 m) are associated with larger atmospheric attenuation due
    to a thicker water vapor layer to which LST and ET are very sensitive. Therefore,
    LST and ET between flights at different altitudes would not only be affected by
    the spatial resolution (e.g., the model sensitivity to the different input spatial
    resolution), but also to the uncertainties in input retrieval (e.g. the thermal
    images atmospheric corrections). One meter resolution was optimal for the performance
    of TSEB-PT and coarser resolutions, especially larger than 10 m, downgraded the
    accuracy significantly. Therefore, coarse resolution studies typically applied
    in large-scale agronomic, hydrological and environmental research should consider
    this uncertainty when coupling UAV thermal data over agricultural fields for ET
    calculation. Wang et al. (2019) found similar results for ET modelled by the Priestley-Taylor
    Jet Propulsion Laboratory model against eddy covariance measurements. Several
    analyses of the effect from the spatial resolution on the ET modelling using satellite
    data for large fields showed that important spatial patterns would be lost at
    coarser spatial resolution (Li et al., 2008, Li et al., 2021). Therefore, the
    utilization of UAV data could be an efficient and functional support for satellite-based
    LST analyses. The high temporal resolution is another important merit of UAV systems.
    Previous studies using a diurnal timescale revealed the ratio of actual to potential
    ET being higher in the morning, decreasing at noon hours and ‘recovering’ in the
    afternoon, referred to as hysteresis effect (Antoniuk et al., 2021). In this study
    (Fig. 5, Fig. 6), similar results were found especially for the full-irrigated
    area with ample water supply (e.g., 12 July 2018). The agreement between TSEB-PT
    modelled Tr and sap flow measurements during morning hours on the 12, 19 and 24
    July 2018 (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) should be noted. Both initially followed ETp but started
    to deviate earlier in the drought stressed plants (at a level around 0.2 mm h-1
    or less) than in the fully irrigated (at a level around 0.3 mm h-1). Drought stressed
    plants are capable of transpiring at potential rate in the early morning hours,
    as they rehydrate during night and use water stored in plant tissue (Andersen
    et al., 1991) for Tr, which however quickly cease when the difference between
    Tr and root water uptake leads to tissue dehydration (Jensen et al., 1993, Katerji
    et al., 1986). This diurnal temporal resolution of the UAV data offers the opportunity
    to explore the variation of the heat flux of agricultural fields within a day
    at hourly resolution, which could promote precision irrigation activities (Fig.
    8). The high spatial resolution of UAV data can also have shortcomings, mainly
    related to covering larger fields, flight limitations under weather with strong
    winds and radiometric uncertainty of the thermal micro-bolometer cameras. Also,
    integrated within smart-farming solutions, UAV systems/services appear out of
    reach, e.g., in the Mediterranean region, where many farming systems utilize satellite
    data as a decision-support option, due to free access and considerably lower cost.
    Several studies have conducted relatively reliable modelling of ET by TSEB-PT
    at spatial resolution of 20 to 60 m using Sentinel-2 and -3 images (Bellvert et
    al., 2020, Guzinski and Nieto, 2019) or Landsat (Knipper et al., 2019) at 30 m
    spatial resolution. However, for the requirements of practical agronomic operations
    and precision agriculture targeting reduced and especially deficit irrigation
    (DI), finer and more precise LST data are needed and this is one of the largest
    merits of UAV. LST images collected by thermal cameras mounted on UAVs contain
    sources of uncertainty, such as the internal non-uniformity correction (NUC) and
    temperature drift, and environmental factors (e.g., air humidity and surface emissivity
    property) (Aubrecht et al., 2016, Meier et al., 2011, Mesas-Carrascosa et al.,
    2018, Olbrycht et al., 2012). These uncertainties affect the quality of the UAV
    LST images, thus special attention (e.g., camera system updating and LST data
    radiometric calibration) should be given to the data collection. 4.3. Drought
    stress detection and implications for irrigation management The positive relationship
    between both LWP and gs with Tr coincide with Xue et al. (2021) for tomato cultivated
    in a climate chamber at different (full/deficit) irrigation and salinity levels.
    The distribution of low and full irrigation data points in Fig. 7 shows a division
    at a Tr level of approximately 0.28 mm h−1, which corresponds to LWP of −0.8 MPa,
    a threshold value for drought stress that was supported in previous studies (Hsiao
    and Acevedo, 1975, Taiz and Zeiger, 2010). However, these thresholds depend on
    both the environmental conditions and the crop development stage (e.g. García-Tejera
    et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2022) and need caution for field irrigation scheduling
    and operation to not induce severe yield losses. The spatial distribution of the
    WUE indicated that slight but not severe drought stress derived from low irrigation
    could increase WUE (e.g. on 02 July 2018 in Fig. 8). This agrees with Zhang et
    al., 2022, Liu et al., 2005a, Liu et al., 2005b, and Liu et al. (2006a), who concluded
    that mild soil water deficit improved WUE of potatoes since crop Tr was significantly
    reduced but crop photosynthesis and growth rate were maintained. Besides improving
    WUE, the irrigation strategies other than full irrigation, such as partial root-zone
    drying (PRD) and DI could help crops to enhance root systems and increase soil
    nutrient uptake (Kirda et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006b, Shahnazari et al., 2007).
    However, in comparison to DI, the applicability of PRD for large-field management
    is relatively low (except for furrow/ridge crops) and uniform DI is currently
    more feasible. Compared to the use of soil water balance models in the DI application,
    which increases risks of yield loss (Trout et al., 2020) due to underestimation
    of drought stress or reasons like misjudged root depth in all or parts of a field,
    direct spatio-temporal resolved measurements of actual ET (the ratio or difference
    between actual and potential ET, which were demonstrated in this study) could
    provide new opportunities for regulated DI scheduling with high precision and
    less risk of yield loss. Specifically for potatoes, reducing irrigation to 70–75%
    of ET during the late stages of growth has shown promising results (Crosby and
    Wang, 2021, Shahnazari et al., 2007) while many other crops typically are less
    sensitive to mild drought during their vegetative growth (Steduto et al., 2012).
    Development of such tools and strategies to increase WUE is urgently needed to
    support global food security in the light of ever-increasing competition for finite
    water resources worldwide (Steduto et al., 2012). In the current study, the modelled
    IR reflected the modelled ET and NPP well (Fig. 8), indicating the water need
    for the stressed plants with low ET, hence low NPP. Drought and heat stress are
    intimately connected, since drought may induce extreme canopy temperatures due
    to lack of evaporative cooling as shown in this study and elsewhere (Berg et al.,
    2015), while high temperatures due to its linkage with vapor pressure deficit
    may induce drought stress (e.g. Lesk et al., 2021, Lobell et al., 2013, Zhang
    et al., 2022). Therefore, it is intrinsically difficult to single out their individual
    effects and their interaction on crop growth. Present crop simulations models
    may not adequately consider a rise of canopy temperature of 20–25 °C above measured
    air temperature, as seen here, due to drought. This coupling thus remains a gap
    in understanding present and future climate impacts on crop productivity (Lesk
    et al., 2021). In our simple approach to distinguish the effects of the two factors,
    we used a moisture-insensitive data driven NPP model (Peng et al., 2021a) in combination
    with the present TSEB-PT to derive WUE, which is a key factor to consider in water-limited
    environments. Peng et al. (2021a) firstly quantified the effect from daily maximum
    air temperature on the potato NPP based on statistical analysis of historical
    data for irrigated potatoes (Table 4 and Fig. 5 A from Peng et al. (2021a)). The
    NPP model takes daily maximum air temperature as one of the inputs, although it
    may be argued that LST would be a better input, which displayed reduced and even
    halted photosynthesis and growth of potato under prevailing air temperatures for
    both irrigated and non-irrigated treatments (e.g., 12 and 24 July 2018 and 26
    July 2019, Fig. 8) and this is in line with results of Timlin et al. (2006). From
    a management perspective, this raises the dilemma whether it is worthwhile to
    irrigate a crop during high temperature periods. The NPP model (Peng et al., 2021a)
    predicts a parabolic decrease of production from an optimum daily max temperature
    of c. 17 ℃ to zero at c. 29 ℃. Thus, raising temperatures above 17 ℃ will almost
    certainly decrease WUE and the profitability of irrigation. Nevertheless, irrigation
    will help to sustain crop’s survival by cooling (Lobell et al., 2008) and decrease
    production (and possible quality) losses in the indicated temperature range. Adequate
    water supply may even cool the crop to several degrees below the ambient air temperature
    (Antoniuk et al., 2021). The accurate estimation of ET (thus drought stress) and
    IR also contributes to the estimation of N deficiency and fertilization amount
    since drought limits the plant’s ability for nutrient uptake, despite these being
    abundant in the root zone (Dalla Costa et al., 1997, Obidiegwu et al., 2015, Peng
    et al., 2021b). Therefore, future studies should investigate how well drought
    and nutrient deficiency stress could be distinguished. Overall, our approach for
    the ET modelling and IR calculation have demonstrated the large potential for
    application to operational irrigation scheduling that seems especially promising
    for the management of regulated DI and associated water savings. 5. Conclusion
    In this paper, the TSEB-PT model was applied using thermal, multispectral and
    RGB images obtained by UAVs to calculate actual Tr and ET of potato plants grown
    under contrasting irrigation treatments on a sandy soil, and to quantify drought
    stress and irrigation requirements. The main findings can be summarized, as follows:
    (i) The TSEB-PT modelled Tr corresponded well with measured sap flow and spatial
    sensitivity test revealed that 1 m was the optimal spatial resolution. (ii) Diurnal
    variation of Tr followed the sap flow observations and convincingly revealed the
    effect of drought on plant Tr and ET. The results pinpointed the need for surface
    energy balance models to account for evaporation from the leaf surface from dew
    and irrigation intercepted water, especially for high latitude areas. The modelled
    Tr was well-correlated to plant physiological parameters LWP and gs. (iii) A simple
    way to distinguish drought and heat stress was presented, which could be helpful
    for making more informed decisions on management strategies to alleviate these
    confounded stressors. (iv) Precise quantitative irrigation requirements were derived
    from TSEB-PT. Therefore, the approach has potential for accurate spatio-temporally
    resolved estimation of plant drought status and IRs as required for water saving

    Appendix A. The equation for aerodynamic resistance at the surface (rA) is given
    as (Norman et al., 1995): (A.1) r A = ln z U - d z M - ψ M ln z T A - d z M -
    ψ H k 2 U where z U and z T A are the heights of wind speed (U, m s−1) and air
    temperature (TA, ℃) measurements respectively, and they are 2 m in this paper.
    d is the zero-plane displacement height (d = 0.65 hC, where hC is canopy height
    and it was calculated as a difference between instantaneous digital surface and
    elevation models calculated before plant emergence), zM is roughness length for
    momentum transport (zM = hC/8), k is von Kármán constant (0.41). ψM and ψH are
    the adiabatic correction factors for momentum and heat transports and they are
    given in Brutsaert (2005). These corrections depend on the atmospheric stability,
    which is described using Obukhov stability length L (m): (A.2) L = - u ∗ 3 k (
    g T A ) ( H C P ρ + 0.61 T A E ρ ) where g is acceleration of gravity (9.8 m s−2),
    H is sensible heat flux, CP is heat capacity of air (J kg−1 k−1), ρ is air density
    (kg m−3), E is evaporation, u* is friction velocity and it is defined as: (A.3)
    u ∗ = kU ln Z U - d z M - ψ M Z U - d L + ψ M Z M L In the iterative process of
    TSEB-PT, the initial value of L was given as infinite ( Z U - d L and Z M L were
    therefore 0, i.e. stable conditions), then Eqs. A1-5 were solved and initial r
    A was obtained. With the progress of the iterative process, H and E values in
    Eq. A(4) are updated, thus Eqs. A1-5 are updated as well, and eventually r A is
    determined when iterative process finishes. The details for iterative process
    are shown in Appendix B. The equation for aerodynamic resistance at the canopy
    surface (rX) is given as (Norman et al., 1995): (A.4) r X = C '' LAI l w U d +
    Z M 1 / 2 where C’ is derived from weighting a coefficient in the equation for
    leaf boundary layer resistance over the height of the canopy, and the value is
    set to 90 s1/2m−1, LAI is leaf area index and it is given as Eq. (11) in the main
    body of the paper, l w is effective leaf size, and it is given as 0.05 m in this
    paper as an observed mean size of the potato leaflets. In addition, U d + Z M
    is the wind direction at the source-sink height ( d + z M ) given as: (A.5) U
    d + Z M = U C e - μ 1 - d + Z M h C where UC is wind speed at top of the canopy
    height (hC), and it is given as: (A.6) U C = U ln ( h C - d z M ) ln ( Z U - d
    z M ) - ψ M μ is calculated as: (A.7) μ = 0.28 F 2 / 3 h C 1 / 3 S - 1 / 3 The
    equation for aerodynamic resistance at the soil surface (rS) is given as (Kustas
    et al. 2016): (A.8) r S = 1 0.0038 ( T S - T A ) 1 / 3 + 0.012 U S Where US is
    wind speed at a height (typically 0.05–0.2 m) above the soil surface where the
    effect of the soil surface roughness is minimal and it is given as: (A.9) U S
    = U C e - μ ( 1 - 0.05 h C ) Appendix B. The steps for the iterative process are
    (Norman et al., 1995): 1). initially estimate canopy temperature (TC) as minimum
    of air temperature (TA, which can be obtained from meteorological data) and radiometric
    temperature (Trad(θO)) which is land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from
    UAV thermal image. 2). calculate soil temperature (TS) based on Eq. (6) since
    both of Trad(θO) and TC are known. 3). calculate net longwave radiation for canopy
    (LnC) and soil (LnS) with initial values of TC and TS. The calculations are shown
    in Appendix C. 4). calculate net radiation for canopy (RnC) as the sum of LnC
    and net shortwave radiation for canopy (SnC), likewise for net radiation for soil
    (RnS), which is the sum of LnS and net shortwave radiation for soil (SnS). The
    calculations are shown in Appendix C. 5). calculate canopy latent heat flux (LEC)
    and canopy sensible heat flux (HC) based on Eq. (10), (2). (B.1) H C = Rn C -
    LE C = Rn C ( 1 - α PT f g Δ Δ + γ (B.2) LE C = Rn C - H C where αPT is the Priestley-Taylor
    coefficient initially set to 1.26, fg is fraction of green canopy, Δ is the slope
    of saturation vapour pressure with temperature and γ is the psychometric constant.
    6). recalculate TC. Here, the TC will be recalculated for the series resistance
    network. The linearized form of Eq. (6) in the main body of the paper is proposed
    to calculate T C , L i n and small correction factor ( Δ T C ). TC can be calculated
    as: (B.3) T C = T C , L i n + Δ T C T C , L i n and Δ T C are given as: (B.4)
    T C , L i n = T A r A + T rad ( θ O ) r S 1 - f C ( θ O ) + H C r X ρ C P 1 r
    A + 1 r S + 1 r X 1 r A + 1 r S + f C ( θ O ) r X 1 - f C ( θ O ) (B.5) Δ T C
    = T rad 4 θ O - f C ( θ O ) T C , L i n 4 - 1 - f C ( θ O ) T D 4 4 1 - f C (
    θ O ) T D 3 1 + r S r A + 4 f C ( θ O ) T C , L i n 3 where rA is surface resistance,
    rX and rS are the canopy and soil resistances and the calculation equations for
    rA, rX and rS are shown in Appendix A, ρ is air density and CP is the heat capacity
    of air, fc(θO) is the fraction of vegetation observed by the thermal sensor and
    its calculation is shown in the main body of the paper, TD is given as: (B.6)
    T D = T C , L i n 1 + r S r A - H C r X ρ C P 1 + r S r X + r S r A - T A r S
    r A 7). repeat step 2 to recalculate TS and then recalculate rS and TAC; 8). calculate
    HS using Eq. (8), and G as: (B.7) G = 0.35 Rn S 9). Calculate LEC and LES using
    Eqs. (2), (3). At this stage, the initial LES estimate is likely to yield negative-unrealistic
    values at daytime indicating dew condensation at soil surface. TSEB-PT then iteratively
    reduces αPT in Eq. (10) in the main body of the paper and re-computes all temperatures
    and fluxes until realistic LES and LEC are obtained (i.e. null or positive). Appendix
    C. The net longwave radiation for canopy (LnC) and soil (LnS) are calculated by
    (Campbell and Norman, 2012): (C.1) Ln C = 1 - e - k L L A I ( L sky + L S - 2
    L C ) (C.2) Ln S = e - k L L A I L sky + 1 - e - k L F L C - L S where kL is extinction
    coefficient for thermal radiation and it is set to 0.95, LAI is leaf area index
    and it is given as Eq. (11) in the main body of the paper, Lsky is the sky longwave
    irradiance, and it can be estimated from meteorological data, LC and LS are longwave
    emission from canopy and soil and the calculation equations are: (C.3) L C = ε

    as 0.98) and soil (set as 0.95), σ is Stephan-Boltzmann constant (5.67037 × 10-8
    W m−2 K−4). The net radiation for canopy (RnC) is the sum of LnC and net shortwave
    radiation for canopy (SnC), likewise for net radiation for soil (RnS), which is
    the sum of LnS and net shortwave radiation for soil (SnS). The equations are (Campbell
    and Norman, 2012): (C.5) Rn C = Ln C + Sn C (C.6) Rn S = Ln S + Sn S The calculation
    equations for SnC and SnS are (Campbell and Norman, 2012): (C.7) Sn C = 1 - τ

- analysis: The present study contributes to the development of real-time, end-to-end
    automated systems for soil moisture management in irrigated systems by (1) introducing
    a novel multi-level pre-processing framework based on the combination of Boruta
    gradient boosting decision tree (Boruta-GBDT), a targeted feature selection model,
    with the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and several advanced
    machine learning (ML) models including bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU),
    cascaded forward neural network (CFNN), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), genetic
    programming (GP), and classical multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP); (2)
    implementing multi-step (one and seven days ahead) daily forecasting of Surface
    soil moisture (SSM) based on the NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-satellite
    datasets in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran; (3) developing a novel multi-phase
    pre-processing hybridized ML approach for SSM forecasting; (4) integrating the
    Boruta-GBDT, a targeted feature selection algorithm, with the MVMD and several
    advanced ML models; and (5) identifying the most influential input variables and
    selecting the most relevant sub-sequences from a large pool of decomposed sub-components
    by the Boruta-GBDT scheme. Overall, the proposed framework enables the accurate,
    scalable, and interpretable forecasting of SSM, which is critical for real-time
    irrigation management and sustainable water use in agricultural systems.

  description: The objective of this study is to develop a novel multi-level pre-processing
    framework and apply it for multi-step (one and seven days ahead) daily forecasting
    of Surface soil moisture (SSM) based on the NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive
    (SMAP)-satellite datasets in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. The framework
    consists of the Boruta gradient boosting decision tree (Boruta-GBDT) feature selection
    integrated with the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and advanced
    machine learning (ML) models including bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU),
    cascaded forward neural network (CFNN), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), genetic
    programming (GP), and classical multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP). For
    this purpose, effective geophysical soil moisture predictors for two arid stations
    of Khosrowshah and Neyshabur were first filtered among 21 daily input signals
    from 2015 to 2020 by using the Boruta-GBDT feature selection. The selected signals

    Get rights and content Abstract The objective of this study is to develop a novel
    multi-level pre-processing framework and apply it for multi-step (one and seven
    days ahead) daily forecasting of Surface soil moisture (SSM) based on the NASA’s
    Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-satellite datasets in arid and semi-arid regions
    of Iran. The framework consists of the Boruta gradient boosting decision tree
    (Boruta-GBDT) feature selection integrated with the multivariate variational mode
    decomposition (MVMD) and advanced machine learning (ML) models including bidirectional
    gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), cascaded forward neural network (CFNN), adaptive
    boosting (AdaBoost), genetic programming (GP), and classical multilayer perceptron
    neural network (MLP). For this purpose, effective geophysical soil moisture predictors
    for two arid stations of Khosrowshah and Neyshabur were first filtered among 21
    daily input signals from 2015 to 2020 by using the Boruta-GBDT feature selection.
    The selected signals were then decomposed using the MVMD scheme. In the last pre-processing
    stage, the most relevant sub-sequences from a large pool in previous process were
    filtered using the Boruta-GBDT scheme aiming to reduce the computation and enhance
    the accuracy, before feeding the ML approaches. The comparison of the results
    from the five hybrid and standalone counterpart models in term of standardized
    RMSE improvement (SRMSEI) revealed that - - for SSM(T+1) 27.13% and SSM (T+7)
    43.55% at Khosrowshah station and SSM(T+1) 21.16% and SSM (T+7) 30.10% at Neyshabur
    station outperformed the other hybrid frameworks, followed by - - , -BG- , - -
    , and - - . The accurately forecasted SSM data help improve irrigation scheduling,
    which is of significant importance in water use efficiency and food security.

    Introduction 1.1. Research background A crucial state variable in the climate
    system that regulates the flow of water, carbon, and energy between the atmosphere
    and the land surface is soil moisture (SM) (Peng et al., 2017). It has significant
    effects on a variety of processes and feedback loops that occur within the Earth
    (Seneviratne et al., 2010, Senyurek et al., 2020). As a result, SM datasets are
    crucial for numerous uses in the field of geoscience and a number of other fields
    such as hydrology, agriculture, and water resources management (Jamei et al.,
    2022c, Karimi et al., 2020, Maroufpoor et al., 2019, Zheng et al., 2022). SM is
    basically defined as the overall volume of water within an unsaturated zone (Hillel,
    2003). In practice, SM is mostly referred to the soil water accessible to plants
    in the root zone, while surface soil moisture (SSM) represents the water content
    in top soil. The gravimetric unit (g/cm3), which is not under the influence of
    soil properties, can be used to describe SM. Field capacity and wilting point
    are also used to quantify SM conditions (Givi et al., 2004, Ulaby et al., 1979).
    1.2. Surface soil moisture measurement Different techniques such as capacitance
    sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR), and electrical resistivity method have
    been used to measure SSM (S.U. et al., 2014, Vereecken et al., 2014). Dobriyal
    et al. (2012) and Robock et al. (2000) provided more information on these techniques.
    These methods enable the acquisition of SM measurements at a point scale. They
    are relatively easy to implement and able to detect soil moisture at various soil
    depths. The measurements obtained using these techniques are typically accepted
    as the “ground truth”. The long-term operational SM measurement techniques with
    ground sensors have been established with significant efforts (Crow et al., 2012).
    However, the in-situ SSM observations are not typical for the surrounding areas
    because of the significant spatial variability of SM over varying scales. This
    geographical variability of SM is also contributed by other factors such as the
    complexity of the interaction mechanism between numerous environmental variables,
    including soil structure, soil texture, land cover patterns, topographic features,
    and climatic forces. Various physical, empirical, and semi-empirical models have
    been developed to quantify SM over bare soil surfaces (Dave et al., 2021). Some
    physical models such as physical optical (PO) model, small perturbation model
    (SPM), geometric optics (GO), and advanced integrated equation model (AIEM) (Bai
    et al., 2015) have been widely used for retrieving SM up to a specified range
    of surface characteristic and surface roughness. The semi-empirical water cloud
    model (WCM) is based on the radiative transfer theory for the recovery of crop-covered
    SM and vegetation characteristics (Attema and Ulaby, 1978) and has been extended
    by various authors (Ulaby et al., 1984). However, the lack of knowledge of the
    radiative transfer-based microwave response for bare and vegetated soil surfaces
    has made the semi-empirical and physical models more difficult to use. In addition,
    these models require more parameters, which have increased their complexity (Jiang
    et al., 2022, Khan et al., 2022). 1.3. Review of surface soil moisture prediction
    Developments of satellite-based remote sensing technologies have produced unique
    soil moisture datasets with different spatial and temporal scales, which are practically
    inaccessible through in situ ground-based data networks (Abbaszadeh et al., 2021).
    Nowadays, microwave remote sensing (active and passive) is a suitable technique
    for estimating global SSM, due to the sensitivity of microwave sensors (radiometers
    and radars) to soil dielectric constant (Portal et al., 2020, Steele-Dunne et
    al., 2021). The impacts of surface roughness, vegetation attenuation effects,
    and atmospheric attenuation effects are less for lower microwave frequencies (L-band,
    1–2 GHz), in comparison with higher microwave frequencies (Montzka et al., 2020).
    Also, L-band microwave tends to penetrate deeper into the vegetation canopy and
    soil depth (Entekhabi et al., 2010b). Therefore, the L-band frequency is the most
    appropriate microwave frequency for measuring surface soil moisture. The European
    Space Agency (ESA) and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) developed two L-band missions dedicated to global SSM measurements. The
    ESA’s SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission was launched in 2009, and
    the NASA’s SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) was launched in 2015 (Jamei et
    al., 2020). Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been extensively
    considered for solving high-nonlinear engineering problems (Alade et al., 2021,
    Jamei et al., 2022b, Xu and Zhang, 2022, Zhang and Xu, 2021). The complexity of
    the SM phenomena emphasizes the exploration of advanced technologies such as soft
    computing in the form of AI models (Ali et al., 2015, Ge et al., 2019). The widely
    used AI models for prediction of SM include artificial neural network (Srivastava
    et al., 2013, Xing et al., 2017), support vector regression (Ahmad et al., 2010,
    Pasolli et al., 2011), deep learning (Achieng, 2019, Orth, 2021), random forest
    (RF) (Adab et al., 2020, de Oliveira et al., 2021), and fuzzy logic (Chaudhary
    et al., 2021). Recently, more efforts are concentrated on the integrated or hybrid
    models in order to enhance the prediction and learning processes of the AI models
    (Prasad et al., 2018). Sedaghat et al. (2022) utilized spectral indices of Sentinel-2
    for different provinces in Iran using 124 soil samples. Hajdu et al. (2018) developed
    an RF model for SM modeling based on spatio-temporal resolution of C-band Sentinel-1.
    The modeling was conducted based on radar data, degree of vegetation coverage,
    and landscape parameters in a case study in New Zealand. Different AI models (including
    polynomial regression, elastic net regression, ridge regression, lasso regression,
    and RF) were developed for SSM simulations for several provinces in China (Wang
    et al., 2022). Different features have been used to form the prediction matrix,
    including vegetation cover, soil texture, elevation, and geographical location.
    The AI-based SSM modeling studies showed a successful track of progress (Abowarda
    et al., 2021, Babaeian et al., 2021, Greifeneder et al., 2021). Although AI models
    have been used for estimating SSM, there are many research gaps and limitations.
    For instance, the implementation of geophysical satellite data is still limited
    and more investigations are needed. In addition, the optimization of input data
    for SSM prediction is still an obstacle that needs to be resolved by using some
    advanced feature selection, one of the essential steps for enhancing the learning
    process of the predictive models (Roy, 2022). Furthermore, pre-processing of the
    SM data plays an essential role in the learning process of the forecasting models.
    1.4. Research contribution and objectives To fill the research gaps, it is crucial
    to explore new advanced methodologies for SSM quantification (Ali et al., 2015).
    The feasibility of satellite imagery provides a reliable source of remote sensing
    data, which can help remarkably in developing a state-of-the-art alternative technology
    for geo-science and engineering sustainability and management. The overall goal
    of this study is to introduce a new AI methodology for satellite data based SSM
    forecasting. The specific objectives are: (i) to develop new methodology for long-term
    SSM forecasting using the NASA’s SMAP satellite data, (ii) to implement multi-step
    (one and seven days ahead) daily forecasting, (iii) to develop a novel multi-level
    pre-processing framework for arid and semi-arid regions in Iran, and (iv) to integrate
    the Boruta gradient boosting decision tree (Boruta-GBDT), a targeted feature selection
    model, with the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and several
    advanced machine learning (ML) models. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area
    This research focuses on forecasting of SSM (5 cm) utilizing the SMAP microwave
    satellite products at two agrometeorological stations of IRIMO (Islamic Republic
    of Iran Meteorological Organization), Neyshabur and Khosrowshahr (Fig. 1). The
    Neyshabur station is located in northeastern Iran (36° 16’ 00” N, 58° 47’ 60”
    E) with an average elevation of 1,213 m. The climate in this area is cold and
    arid (Asadi Oskouei et al., 2022), with an average annual temperature of 15 °C.
    January is the coldest month and July is the warmest month. The mean annual precipitation
    is 231 mm and the annual average relative humidity is 49% in Neyshabur (https://irimo.ir).
    The Khosrowshahr station is situated in northeastern Iran (37° 58’ 00” N, 46°
    01’ 60” E) at an average elevation of 1,338 m. Khosrowshahr has a cold and semi-arid
    climate (Asadi Oskouei et al., 2022) with an average annual temperature of 14.5
    °C; January is the coldest, and July is the warmest month. The mean annual precipitation
    is 237 mm, and the annual average relative humidity is 51% in Khosrowshahr (https://irimo.ir).

    and passive (SMAP) mission and data NASA launched the SMAP mission in March 2015
    to retrieve the global SSM from L-band microwave observations at the top 5 cm
    of surface soil, with a volumetric accuracy of 0.04 cm3 cm (RMSE), global coverage
    in 2–3 days, and a spatial resolution of about 40 km (Entekhabi et al., 2010a).
    The SMAP mission provides 15 distributable data products at four levels of data
    processing (Colliander et al., 2021). The Level 4 SM algorithm produces the SMAP
    Level 4 products by using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to integrate the SMAP
    observations (brightness temperature) with soil moisture estimations obtained
    from the NASA catchment land surface model (Reichle et al., 2018). In the present
    study, SMAP Level 4 Global 3-hourly 9 km EASE-Grid Surface Soil Moisture Geophysical
    Data, Version 6 (SPL4SMGP) products were downloaded from the NASA National Snow
    and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) (https://nsidc.org/data/SPL4SMGP/versions/6) for the
    Neyshabur and Khosrowshahr areas. The geophysical parameters of the SPL4SMGP products
    include surface soil moisture (0–5 cm), root zone (0–100 cm) soil moisture, soil
    temperature, surface meteorological forcing variables, snow states, runoff, and
    land surface fluxes (Reichle et al., 2018). In the current study, 22 datasets
    (daily average values) were extracted from the SPL4SMGP product as the input data
    of the model to forecast daily SSM. The descriptions of the 22 geophysical datasets
    are presented in Table 1. The descriptive statistics of the datasets for Khosrowshahr
    and Neyshabur are presented in Table 2. At Khosrowshahr station, the distributions
    of daily SSM, LFS, LFU, LAI, NDSF, RSDF, RSBF, STLs (Layers 1–6), SHL, SP, ST,
    TL, VGF, and WSL data were close to normal distributions with a skewness range
    of [−0.82, 0.82], and had a platykurtic distribution with Kurtosis < 0. At Neyshabur
    station, the daily SSM, LFS, LAI, and WSL data with a skewness range of [0.5,
    1.63] was close to near-normal distributions and had a leptokurtic distribution
    with Kurtosis > 0, while the daily LFU, NDSF, RSDF, RSBF, STLs (Layer 1 to 6),
    SHL, SP, ST, TL, and VGF data showed nearly normal distributions (−0.81< skewness<
    1.03) and had a platykurtic distribution (Kurtosis < 0). Table 1. Descriptions

    selection Boruta is one of the most effective and smart feature selection algorithms
    (Kursa et al., 2010). It was developed as an easy-to-tune wrapper algorithm for
    predictive modeling and applications (Christ et al., 2016). It automatically filters
    and then selects relevant features. It deletes the redundant features that cause
    noises. Boruta’s working strategy is impressive since it is a statistically grounded
    algorithm in the absence of user input. As the algorithm follows a cross-correlation
    function, it further optimizes the forecast and decreases the input dimensions.
    It has been used for diverse applications such as PM2.5 air quality (Lyu et al.,
    2017), asymptomatic stress (Poona and Ismail, 2014), and marine applications (Li
    et al., 2016). Ahmadpour et al. (2021) used Boruta with GBDT for early detection
    of Alzheimer’s disease using single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis. Boruta’s
    usage in hydrological applications is very recent. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first study, in which Boruta is coupled with GBDT to develop a hybrid
    Boruta-GBDT model for soil moisture forecasting. The Boruta-GBDT algorithm can
    be outlined as the following steps (Jamei et al., 2022a) 1. Take an input vector,
    labeled  and add randomness by creating an ordered duplicate variable x’ . This
    will eliminate the correlations between duplicate predictors and targets ( ).
    This holds true for all discrete input groups ( ), and target variable (   R)
    with multiple inputs (n) and t = 1, 2, …T. 2. As this approach takes Random Forest
    as the basis, the target variable i.e.,  is forecasted with the duplicated inputs
    x’ . and actual inputs . 3. The variance importance measures, i.e., permutation
    importance or mean decrease accuracy (MDA) for each input and respective shadow
    input x’ can be expressed as ( ): (1) in which I( ) indicator function; B bag
    (based on bootstrap aggregation and forecasting error of training samples);  =
    forecasted values before permuting; and  = forecasted values after permuting.
    4. Calculation of the Z-scores, which are given by: (2) The “shadow” attributes
    calculate the maximum Z-score. After the calculation, the Z-scores of the predictors
    are identified with the corresponding duplication and analyzed through the variable
    importance distribution. Fresh inputs that are duplicated are produced, and the
    Boruta algorithm stops when all input parameters are confirmed or the iteration
    threshold is reached. A fusion of Boruta and GBDT produces an equally powerful
    result in combining many weak learners to produce a strong one. An ensemble learning
    method which works by the fusion of multiple decision trees produces a forecasting
    model in boosting the gradient (Friedman, 2001). Unlike traditional regression
    trees, this algorithm builds and iteratively makes an ensemble of weak tree learners
    (hence downscaling) while boosting. At each iterative step, a new regression tree
    is trained, which helps in optimizing the loss function marked by the gradient
    (Lawrence et al., 2004). Moreover, this algorithm has certain characteristics
    with special functions of loss. This uniqueness is not possessed by other ML algorithms.
    GBDT guarantees feasible and efficient performance and is robust to the data that
    are not balanced and outliers. 2.4. Multivariate variational mode decomposition
    (MVMD) Multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) is an extension of the
    variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm that was first developed by Rehman
    and Aftab (2019), especially for multi-channel and multi-variate data. VMD is
    a modern tool for signal processing, in which the input signal is bifurcated into
    several band-limited IMFs. This is noise-sensitive. Very few MVMD studies have
    conducted (Gavas et al., 2020). So, this technique addresses the limitations of
    other algorithms: (i) It is free from all the standard issues of EMD, such as
    the absence of mathematical structure; (ii) It is sensitive to the noise and sampling
    rate; (iii) different channels of mode-mixing exist amongst several MEMD; and
    (iv) absence of mode separation capability. Generally, multivariate oscillations
    are modeled. This is done through signal representation that is analytic in nature
    and based on Hilbert transform (i.e., multivariate instantaneous frequency). The
    developed model is then designed particularly as an extension of the VMD model.
    Fourier transform is employed with an optimization approach, which gives the advantage
    of clarity and removal of redundancy from the input data to get modulated multivariate
    oscillations. Mathematically, MVMD identifies M significant modes from an input
    real-valued signal having D channels ( ). (3) in which (4) where and denote the
    phase function and amplitude, respectively, for the th signal component. Under
    the assumption that each element is strongly coupled to its central frequency
    , this MVMD method autonomously decomposes multichannel signals into multiple
    multivariate modulated oscillations with direct physical significance. Each mode’s
    total bandwidth should be kept to a minimum. The real mode element’s center frequency
    and element bandwidth are continually revised throughout the iterative procedure.
    The algorithm’s stages are outlined as follow (Rehman and Aftab, 2019): (a) The
    analytic signal of is derived after the Hilbert transform: (5) (b) Every analytical
    signal’s spectrum is transformed to baseband by establishing the starting center
    frequency to a value that corresponds to the frequency shift’s characteristic:
    (6) (c) For this shifted signal, the squared L2-norm of the gradient shape of
    is utilized to determine the bandwidth of , and the objective function for MVMD
    is given by (Rehman and Aftab, 2019): (7) The analytical modulation signal for
    mode m and channel d is represented by in Eq. (4). (d) Constrained MVMD optimization
    can now be expressed as (Rehman and Aftab, 2019): (8) MVMD model solution This
    variational constraint object function is solved by using two penalty terms. A
    quadratic term and a Lagrangian multiplier ( ) are employed to ensure tight compliance
    with restrictions in order to increase the precision of the reconstruction. Then,
    an unconstrained variational problem is generated, which assures that the solution
    method is completed more quickly. Finally, the final augmented Lagrangian function
    is constructed as follows: (9) With the assistance of an alternative direction
    technique of the multipliers algorithm (ADMM) (Rehman and Aftab, 2019), this issue
    is skilfully resolved. An optimization issue that is complicated is broken down
    into multiple sub-optimization problems, each of which is reasonably easy in its
    own right. Updating mode The sub-optimization issues in the th repetition of the
    mode update are given prime importance to emphasize: (10) Additionally, Eq. (9)
    is identical to the following formula: (11) The method is transferred to frequency
    domain using the Parseval theorem (Rehman and Aftab, 2019): (12) By substituting
    in front for ( ), and then using non-negative frequency domain integration, the
    sub-optimization model is created: (13) Get the frequency domain update shown
    below: (14) Updating center frequency It is possible to simplify this issue by
    assuming that does not affect the final two terms of the Lagrangian: (15) Eq.
    (12) is turned into a Fourier-domain issue as per Plancherel Theorem: (16) The
    total of the foregoing quadratic functions (QFs) is minimized by setting the first
    derivative of the QF to zero and performing some basic algebraic operations on
    the result. The following relationships are established as a result of this procedure:
    (17) 2.5. Bidirectional gate recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) Chung et al. (2014) proposed
    Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a simplified version of the LSTM cell that requires
    less training time while improving the network performance. GRU and LSTM functions
    are similar. However, GRU cells utilize a hidden state that combines the forget
    gate and the input gate into a single updated gate. In addition, GRU merges the
    hidden and cell states into a single state. As a result, the total number of gates
    in GRU is half of that of LSTM, making GRU a popular version of LSTM cell with
    fewer gates. Update gate and reset gate are the two GRU gates. The GRU model can
    be expressed as: (18) (19) (20) (21) where represents the sigmoid activation function,
    represents the tanh activation function, and signify the weight matrices of variables
    , and , respectively, and is the matrix multiplication. Bidirectional networks
    incorporate some past and future dependencies via forward and backward propagations
    in order to properly learn the time-varying patterns, whereas unidirectional networks
    solely learn from past inputs. Fig. 2 depicts the architecture of the proposed
    Bi-GRU model. The input represents a tensor in three dimensions: (1) the number
    of samples, (2) the number of time steps used to predict soil moisture at the
    next time step, and (3) the number of relevant characteristics. Following that
    is a Bi-GRU layer, which can extract implicit information from properly organized
    input data (Li et al., 2022, Roy, 2022). The model then joins both distinct layers
    to a single output layer: (22) where variables and reflect the output of forward
    and backward hidden layers, respectively, at time t, and , , and represent the
    weights between forward and backward layers and the output bias, respectively.

    Fig. 2. Architecture of Bidirectional GRU model (upper panel) and CFNN (lower
    panel). 2.6. Cascaded forward neural network (CFNN) The neural network approach
    was motivated by research into the biological neural networks of human brains.
    In this method, researchers employ the same technique and pattern that the human
    brain employs while learning and solving problems. This technique employs knowledge
    as numerical weights to determine the connection between datasets (Asl et al.,
    2022). The cascade forward neural network is one of the most popular feed-forward
    neural networks (Fahlman and Lebiere, 1990). Cascade-forward neural networks,
    like feed-forward neural networks, connect each input and preceding layer to the
    subsequent layers. In a three-layer network, the output layer is directly connected
    to both the input and hidden layers. As with feed-forward networks, if there are
    enough hidden neurons in a cascade network with two or more layers, it can successfully
    learn any finite input–output connection. With cascade-forward neural networks,
    any sort of input-to-output mapping is possible. This method takes into account
    the nonlinear association between the variables while keeping the linear relationship
    (Goyal and Goyal, 2011). The governing equation for CFNN can be expressed as:
    (23) where represents the input matrix, represents the target vector, represents
    the weight from bias to hidden layer, represents the weight from input to hidden
    layer, and represents the activation function from the input layer to the output
    layer. Eq. (17) can be rewritten as follows by adding a bias term to the input
    layer and introducing as an activation function for linking the input and output
    layers: (24) 2.7. Adapting boosting ensemble (AdaBoost) Adaptive boosting is a
    collection of several decision trees, each of which is a weak learner and is moderately
    superior to random guessing. However, the adaptive AdaBoost method transfers the
    gradient of previous trees to subsequent trees in order to reduce the error of
    the prior tree. Thus, this successive learning of trees at each stage develops
    a learner’s cognitive capacity. The final prediction is the weighted average of
    each tree’s projections. Due to its strong flexibility, AdaBoost is more resistant
    to outliers and noisy data. In addition, the algorithm is operated such that the
    knowledge gathered by preceding trees is transmitted to subsequent trees, and
    hence they only focus on difficult-to-predict training samples (Freund and Schapire,
    1997). The AdaBoost algorithm can be described as follows: 1- Assume train data
    as , in which is the number of training data, is the input vector, and is the
    target vector. 2- Use the following equation to initialize the weight vector:
    (25) 3- Identify weak learners and perform initialization for (A) Determine (26)
    (B) Calculate the error rate: (27) ɛ If and ɛ , exit the loop (C) Estimate weight
    confidence (28) ɛ ɛ (D) Adjust the weighting of all training data from to : (29)
    (E) If ɛ and , return to A (30) The result is a strong learner composed of weak
    weight learners: (31) 2.8. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network ANN is generally
    used for simulating extremely complicated linear and nonlinear processes in engineering.
    Neurons are the interconnected process units that make up ANN. When developing
    an ANN, a number of parameters must be determined. Transfer function, the number
    of neurons in hidden layers, the learning method, and the number of hidden layers
    are among the most important characteristics (Haykin, 1998). ANNs accurately anticipate
    outcomes and are simple to code (Desai and Shah, 2021). MLP is among the most
    popular ANNs. Its structure is composed of three types of interconnected layers:
    the input layer, where the model inputs are introduced; the output layer, where
    the trained model’s results are obtained; and the hidden layers, which can be
    zero, one, or more and are intermediate layers between the previous layers. The
    connections between them are built on a weight structure whose values are modified
    during model training, establishing a stable framework with decision-making ability.
    The learning process is carried out based on input and output datasets and training
    algorithms. A neuron is mathematically described by the following two equations
    (Fath et al., 2020): (32) (33) where is the input data, is the weights of the
    neurons, represents the bias term, represents the activation function, represents
    the linear output of the linear combination of weighted inputs, and represents
    the neuron’s output signal. MLP-NNs are trained using the back propagation (BP)
    technique, which follows an error-correction-based learning approach (Sabour et
    al., 2022). In the present study, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was used as
    the most common algorithm in neural network training (Gao et al., 2019, Hagan
    and Menhaj, 1994). 2.9. Genetic programming (GP) Genetic programming (GP) is one
    of the evolutionary artificial intelligence computing techniques. It starts with
    an unfit population of programs and makes them fit for a particular task through
    simulations like genetic processes. GP is a technique independent of the domain
    that breeds computer programs population genetically for solving the problem.
    Therefore, it iteratively transforms a computer programs population into a new
    program generation through analog of genetic operations that occur naturally.
    GP has been a widely-used algorithm in many applications. For soil moisture, it
    creates feasible and optimum selection of nonlinear regression models of several
    independent variables. This helps in dealing with situations of various land cover/land
    use (Parasuraman et al., 2007) for the soil moisture estimation in a semi-arid
    watershed using RADARSAT-1 satellite imagery and genetic programming. Kurugodu
    et al. (2018) and Parasuraman et al. (2007) respectively dealt with the problem
    of assessment of soil-fiber composite through GP and detection of seasonal change
    of riparian zones using GP and remote sensing images in a semi-arid watershed.
    2.10. Evaluation of model performance This subsection deals with the evaluation
    of model performance. In this study, several statistical metrics are utilized
    for insightful comparisons and evaluation of the performance of the proposed model.
    This is performed in the independent testing phase based on correlation coefficient
    (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Nash–Sutcliffe
    efficiency (NSE), upper confidence interval ( ), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE),
    and Willmott’s index ( ) (Dawson et al., 2007, Harmel et al., 2010, Jamei et al.,
    2021, Willmott, 1982). Their mathematical equations can be respectively expressed
    as: (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) where  = Soil moisture forecasted,  = Soil
    moisture observed, N = Total number of observed or forecasted SM data points in
    the testing period,  = Average of the group SD Standard deviation  = Mean of forecasted
    SM values,  = Mean of observed SM values,  = Coefficient of variation for forecasted
    SM values,  = Coefficient of variation for observed SM values, The performance
    of the model was assessed by these statistical metrics. Specifically, the model
    performance is classified to be excellent for RMSE < 10%, good for 10% < RMSE
    < 20%, fair for 20% < RMSE < 30%, and poor for RMSE > 30%. If NSE and are equal
    to 1, the model has a perfect performance (Dawson et al., 2007, Harmel et al.,
    2010, Jamei et al., 2021, Willmott, 1982). 3. Model development and mathematical
    aspects The proposed multi-phase pre-processing hybridized ML approach is the
    integration of MVMD, GBDT feature selection, and advanced ML. The models developed
    in this study included - - , - - , - - , and - - along with standalone counterpart
    models (Bi-GRU, CFNN, Adaboost, GP, and MLP). They were used for multi-step forecasting
    of SSMin two selected areas in Iran under different climates. In this regard,
    21 times series of SMAP satellite data from to were collected (Table 1). The MVMD,
    CFNN, GP, and MLP were performed in MATLAB R2019b (The Math Works Inc. USA), and
    AdaBoost and Bi-GRU were programmed in the Python environment using Scikit-learn
    and Tensorflow libraries, respectively. The flowchart of the SMAP-based data intelligent
    frameworks for multi-step forecasting of SSM is shown in Fig. 3. All simulations
    were run on a PC supported by Core i7 Intel@ 3.34 GHz and 16 Gig RAM. Download

    data complementary frameworks for multi-step forecasting of SSM. 3.1. First phase
    of the pre-processing: Filtering significant predictors In the first stage of
    pre-processing process, the significance of all the collected input predictors
    was assessed by a robust nonlinear tree-based feature selection approach (i.e.,
    Boruta-GBDT) for both stations, instead of using Pearson correlation, which just
    covers the linear correlation between the input features and SSM. This pre-processing
    practically excludes the need for Pearson analysis. The analysis demonstrated
    that STL4, LFS, and ORF for Khosrowshah and LFS and LFU for Neyshabur had the
    Z-score greater than 3 in comparison with the other features. The results of the
    data filtering process according to the Z-score criterion related to each of the
    predictors and the Max_shadow benchmark showed that in Khosrowshah and Neyshabur,
    16 and 18 inputs from the 21 SSM predictors were preserved, respectively, and
    the rest of the inputs were omitted due to their low importance. The results for
    the first step of data filtering are shown in Table 3 (the first row) and Fig.
    4 (a and b). Dataset pre-processing and feature selection procedure Table 3. Multi-stage

    filtering using multi-level feature selection. 3.2. Second phase of the pre-processing:
    Hybrid models In the second stage, the datasets were first allocated for training
    and testing. Data partitioning has been a challenging topic in models based on
    artificial intelligence. Generally, 60%–80% of the data are used for training
    and the remaining 20%–40% of the data are utilized for testing. In this study,
    the ratio of the training data to the testing data was 3 (i.e., 75% to 25%). In
    order to specify the antecedent time-lagged input signals, the results of cross-correlation
    analysis between each selected predictor and SSM for five historical lags and
    examining models versus lags arrangements ascertained that only the first day
    antecedent information resulted in the promising accuracy, rather than more time
    lag values. Therefore, one-day time lag was used for all input predictors for
    multi-step forecasting of the SSM for both stations. Subsequently, the selected
    input signals from the training dataset were simultaneously decomposed into the
    sub-sequences, including intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residual components
    using the MVMD technique. This is the advantage of the MVMD method over the VMD
    method. The settings of the MVMD process for each station are tabulated in Table
    4. In this research, the optimal number of modes for each station was specified
    using the trial and error process. For Khosrowshah, using K=3, the total number
    of sub-sequences was computed as (16 (3@IMFs+Res) = 64), and for Neyshabur, considering
    K = 5, the number of sub-sequences was estimated as (18 (5@IMFs+Res) = 108). Table

    Filtering significant sequences In the third stage of data preprocessing (i.e.,
    the second stage of sub-sequence filtering), the importance of all sub-components
    resulting from the second stage of preprocessing was evaluated using the Boruta-GBDT
    feature selection and the significant components for multi-step forecasting of
    the SSM in both horizons (one and seven days ahead) were filtered. Figs. 4C–4F
    depict the effective, redundant, and tentative sub-components by using green,
    red, and yellow colors, respectively. Once the importance factor (Z-score) values
    are higher than the Max-Shadow criterion, they can be considered as appropriate
    and effective inputs to feed the models. According to the results in Table 3,
    the second stage sub-sequence data filtering by the Boruta-GBDT scheme for Khosrowshahr
    station for the horizons of SSM(t+1) and SSM(t+7) reduced the dimensions of the
    input matrix by 49.5% and 67%, respectively. In contrast, for Neyshabur station
    for the horizons of SSM(t+1) and SSM(t+7), the dimensionality reduction percentages
    of the input matrix were 65.7% and 80%, respectively. The signals for the selected
    predictors for multi-step forecasting of SSM at each station are presented in
    Fig. 5. 3.4. Setting-parameter optimization Tuning hyper parameters is a crucial
    stage in ML-based forecasting/predicting for highly non-linear engineering problems.
    The lack of optimal selection of hyper parameters may not lead to the best potential
    accuracy of a ML method and cannot provide a fair comparison between available
    methods. For this reason, a grid search strategy was employed to gain the optimal
    tuning parameters in the current research. Table 5 lists the optimal hyper parameters
    obtained with the grid search strategy for the hybrid models (including - - ,
    - - , - - , and - - ). It should be mentioned that all the predictors and the
    target in all the models were scaled in a range of [0, 1] to enhance the efficiency
    and convergence of the models as follows: (41) where is the normalized signal

    hybrid - - model was compared against the - - , - - , - - , - - , CFNN, Bi-GRU,
    MLP, GP, and Adaboost models for (t+1) and (t+7) SSM forecasting horizons at Khosrowshah
    and Neyshabur stations in Iran. The goodness-of-fit metrics including R, RMSE,
    MAPE, NSE, KGE, , and were computed to evaluate the performance of the proposed
    model in comparison with the benchmarking counterparts. Table 6 displays the assessment
    metrics, which were acquired by - - along with the benchmark models during the
    training and testing periods. Clearly, the results show that - - provided better
    simulations of SSM for Khosrowshah in terms of , RMSE 0.0113, MAPE 5.6631, NSE
    0.9506, KGE 0.9594, , and for (t+1), and , RMSE 0.0167, MAPE 7.0666, NSE 0.9131,
    KGE 0.9228, , and for (t+7). It can also be observed from Table 6 that - - was
    the 2nd most accurate model for both (t+1) and (t+7) forecasting horizons. - -
    , - - , and - - models obtained relatively lower scores than - - at both forecasting
    scales. In the group of standalone models, MLP for (t+1) and CFNN for (t+7) achieved
    slightly higher assessment metrics than Bi-GRU, GP, and Adaboost models in the
    forecasting of SSM for Khosrowshah station. Overall, - - is the most efficient
    and accurate SSM forecasting model with the highest degree of accuracy, compared
    with other benchmarking models. As shown in Table 7, for Neyshabur station, -
    - again shows better performances with , RMSE 0.0186, MAPE 6.8553, NSE 0.9456,
    KGE 0.9722, , and for (t+1), and , RMSE 0.0223, MAPE 7.9497, NSE 0.9222, KGE 0.9555,
    , and for (t+7) in the forecasting of SSM against all other hybrid comparing models
    including - - , - - , - - , and - - . Similarly, the proposed - - surpasses the
    standalone Bi-GRU, CFNN, MLP, GP, and Adaboost models to acquire higher accuracy
    at both forecasting horizons (t+1) and (t+7) based on R, RMSE, MAPE, NSE, KGE,
    , and computed for Neyshabur station (Table 7). Thus, - - is the most accurate
    model for both Khosrowshah and Neyshabur stations in the forecasting of SSM for
    (t+1) and (t+7) time horizons. Fig. 6 also shows the best performance of - - in
    the forecasting of SSM for (t+1) and (t+7) horizons for both stations based on
    the values of , NSE, and R. The statistical metrics confirmed that - - had the
    highest NSE and R and the lowest for both (t+1) and (t+7) horizons for Khosrowshah
    and Neyshabur stations. Fig. 6 also indicates that - - showed good forecasting
    consistency in terms of R, NSE, and compared with the four other hybrid models
    (i.e.,  - - , - - , - - , and - - ) and the five standalone models (i.e., Bi-GRU,
    CFNN, MLP, GP, and Adaboost). Table 6. Robustness assessment for Khosrowshah station

    accurate time-series forecasting against the measured SSM for (t+1) and (t+7)
    horizons. Furthermore, the distributions of the violin plots for the measured
    and forecasted SSM are identical and stable for these forecasting horizons for
    Khosrowshah and Neyshabur stations. In contrast, the benchmark hybrid models (i.e.,  -
    - , - - , - - , and - - ) produced relatively inaccurate SSM and displayed significant
    instabilities and spikes. In summary, the - - model yielded more accurate and
    stable simulations for both (t+1) and (t+7) forecasting horizons. Download : Download

    The proposed hybrid - - model used the SMAP-satellite based input predictors to
    decompose into IMFs and residuals factors. The purpose of MVMD was to tackle the
    large noisy fluctuation associated with the non-stationarity and non-linearity
    hurdles, whereas the BG model chose the most pertinent IMF features that were
    used in the CFNN model to forecast the daily SSM for two horizons (i.e., (t+1)
    and (t+7)) for Khosrowshah and Neyshabur stations in Iran. This study demonstrated
    that - - yielded more accurate forecasting than all other models. Fig. 9 shows
    the Taylor diagrams of SSM referenced (i.e., measured) and forecasted by the -
    - , - - , - - , - - , and - - models for (t+1) and (t+7) horizons for both Khosrowshah
    and Neyshabur stations. Taylor diagram (Taylor, 2001) is a comprehensive representation
    to compare and analyze the models in a deep sense based on standard deviation
    and coefficient of correlation with the referenced/measured SSM in a polar coordinate
    system. The Taylor diagrams again ascertained that - - had the best accuracy.
    Fig. 9 evidently indicates that the data points simulated by - - (pink circle)
    are relatively close and fall within the arc of 0.95–0.99 to the referenced SSM
    for both (t+1) and (t+7) for Khosrowshah and Neyshabur stations, followed by -
    - , -BG- , - - , and - - models. This result confirmed that - - provided the best
    and most accurate SSM forecasting with a minimum standard deviation and a maximum
    correlation coefficient. Fig. 10 shows the violin plots of the relative deviation
    percentage distributions of the SSM forecasted by the D-BG- , - - , - - , - -
    , and -BG- models for (t+1) and (t+7) horizons for both Khosrowshah and Neyshabur
    stations. The - - model clearly generated better forecasts with lower relative
    deviation bands [52.45% for (t+1); 52.11% for (t+7)] for Khosrowshah station and
    [59.42% for (t+1); 63.32% for (t+7)] for Neyshabur station, demonstrating that
    the proposed hybrid D- - is an accurate model in comparison with - - , - - , -
    - , and - - in this study. Download : Download high-res image (900KB) Download

    models for Khosrowshah and Neyshabur stations in one and seven days ahead. As
    another diagnostic analysis, the performances of the hybrid and standalone counterpart
    models were assessed by the standardized RMSE improvement (i.e., SRMSEI). Fig.
    11 illustrates the SRMSEI values for both stations and all the hybrid models.
    In fact, this benchmarking procedure shows the effect of MVMD decomposition and
    the second phase data-filtering by Boruta-GBDT on the sub-component input features.
    The results revealed that D-BG- with the most improvement (reduction) for SSM(T+1)
    27.13% and SSM (T+7) 43.55% for Khosrowshah station and SSM(T+1) 21.16% and SSM
    (T+7) 30.10% for Neyshabur station outperformed all other models, followed by
    - - , -BG- , - - , and - - . SSM is a key variable in the energy and water distribution
    between the land surface and the atmosphere (Mousa and Shu, 2020). Furthermore,
    accurate SSM estimates are essential to numerical weather forecasting (Peng et
    al., 2021), extreme events monitoring (droughts and floods), hydrological modeling
    (Jamei et al., 2020), precipitation estimation, groundwater recharge modeling
    (Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018), land surface modeling (Mousa and Shu, 2020),
    as well as irrigation scheduling and management (Natsagdorj et al., 2021). Accordingly,
    the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Global Climate Observing System
    (GCOS) have considered soil moisture as an essential climate variable (ECV) (GCOS-143,
    2010) since 2010 to improve the accuracy of SSM measurements. The proposed hybrid
    modeling approach was novel to construct MVMD and Boruta-GBDT based hybrid models
    to forecast SSM at (t+1) and (t+7) forecast horizons, but some improvements can
    be considered in the future. The black-box nature of the ML and DL generates a
    difficult and challenging circumstance to entirely understand the complex relationship
    between inputs and target in learning process. Thus, explainable AI (i.e., xAI)
    models in combination with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models can be
    a possible research area to explore. In addition, the hybrid MVMD and Boruta-GBDT
    based models can be strengthened with the uncertainty approaches such as Bayesian
    model averaging (Tiwari and Chatterjee, 2011) and ensemble techniques (Sloughter
    et al., 2010). Download : Download high-res image (768KB) Download : Download

    enhance the accuracy of the hybrid D-BG- model to forecast SSM at (t+1) and (t+7)
    horizons. Moreover, the synoptic-scale climate mode indices such as southern oscillation
    index (SOI), sea surface temperatures (Nino3SST, Nino3.4SST, Nino4SST), pacific
    decadal oscillation (PDO), Indian ocean dipole (IOD), El-Nino southern oscillation
    Modoki index (EMI), southern annular mode (SAM) (BAS, 2018, BMA, 2018, Joint Institute
    of the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean, 2018, Nicholls, 2004, Science, 2018,
    SST, 2018) are enormously influential and the employment of these indices can
    further improve the D-BG- precision in the forecast of SSM. In summary, the novel
    - - model has a practical utility in forecasting daily SSM based on the SMAP data.
    The forecasted SSM values are essential for applications such as improved flood
    forecasting systems, runoff prediction, efficient and precise irrigation, and
    crop yield forecasting, especially in arid and semi-arid regions involving water
    scarcity. Download : Download high-res image (281KB) Download : Download full-size

    sign denotes the RMSE reduction owing to the standalone models). 5. Conclusion
    and future direction A novel multi-phase pre-processing hybridized D- - model
    was proposed in this study for SSM forecasting using the SMAP satellite-based
    datasets. The model mainly involved four phases where the SMAP-satellite based
    datasets were used in MVMD to decompose into IMFs and residuals. In the first
    phase, the most influential predictors for each station were selected by using
    Boruta-GBDT among 21 available signals. In the second phase, MVMD acted as a pre-processing
    data decomposition approach to overcome the non-stationarity and non-linearity
    problems and acquire a large pool of IMFs. In the third phase, Boruta-GBDT played
    a filtering role to select the most relevant IMFs from the large pool. In the
    last phase, the CFNN model incorporated the selected IMFs to forecast daily SSM
    for (t+1) and (t+7) for Khosrowshah and Neyshabur stations in Iran. The scope
    of this study can be extended by using the ground-based input data to enhance
    the model’s forecasting capability for SSM. Additionally, the synoptic-scale climate
    mode indices can be utilized to provide more in-depth exploration in the related
    study. The hybridization DL and NWP as well as xAI models can be a new emerging
    area of the research. In addition, the research can be enhanced by the integration
    of ensemble strategies with uncertainty assessment. To benchmark the accuracy
    of - - , it was compared with the hybrid - - , - - , - -GP, and - - models, as
    well as the standalone CFNN, Bi-GRU, MLP, GP, and Adaboost models. Their performances
    were assessed by different statistical metrics including RMSE, MAPE, NSE, KGE,
    IA, and . It was demonstrated that the proposed hybrid - - was the most accurate
    model in the forecasting of daily SSM for (t+1) and (t+7) with , 0.9572; RMSE
    0.0113, 0.0167; MAPE 5.6631, 7.0666; NSE 0.9506, 0.9131; KGE 0.9594, 0.9228; ,
    0.9764; and , 0.0458, respectively for Khosrowshah station. Similarly, the - -
    model was better than the benchmark counterparts in the forecasting of daily SSM
    for both (t+1) and (t+7) horizons for Neyshabur station. Practically, the novel
    - - model can be further expanded and applied to solve various problems in the
    fields of agriculture, environmental science, atmospheric sciences, hydrology,
    and renewable and sustainable energy. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    • Many states with large irrigated areas had no published paper on sensor accuracy
    or application. • Sensor errors were sensitive to calibration used, but not the
    technology or installation orientation. • Sensor-based scheduling used less water
    compared to other scheduling practices and resulted in larger or similar yield.
    Abstract Soil water sensors (SWS) have been widely researched and practiced for
    irrigation scheduling. Due to popularity of this approach, there is a need for

    replacement. CT Canopy temperature. 1. Introduction Soil water sensors (SWS) have
    been recognized as one of the most commonly used approaches in implementing scientific
    irrigation scheduling (Taghvaeian et al., 2020). A vast majority of these sensors
    in the last twenty years have been designed based on technologies relying on electrical
    resistivity and electromagnetic principles. Sensors based on electrical resistance
    indirectly measure soil water tension. These sensors measure changes in electrical
    resistance in soil media, which is calibrated against soil water tension from
    pressure plates or some other methods. On the other hand, sensors based on electromagnetic
    principles rely on dielectric properties of soil to estimate soil water content
    and employ a broad spectrum of methods operating at different frequencies such
    as time domain reflectometry, capacitance, and frequency domain reflectometry,
    to name a few (Evett et al., 2012). The effectiveness and applicability of SWS
    largely depend on their accuracies (Aguilar et al., 2015). Many previous studies
    have assessed the performance of a wide variety of SWS under variable agro-climatological
    conditions (Evett and Parkin, 2005, Ochsner et al., 2013). Some of the major factors
    affecting SWS accuracy are sensor technologies, calibrations used to convert raw
    data to soil water content, soil texture, soil salinity, and installation specifications.
    Minimizing the impact of these factors on SWS accuracy requires more studies to
    be conducted under variable soil and weather conditions. Besides the factors affecting
    accuracy, new SWS are continuously introduced and made commercially available
    by private companies and research organizations. These newer SWS replace older
    sensors and models, creating the need to conduct more experiments to assess their
    performance. Similarly, there is a continuous need to review the SWS accuracy
    studies to keep researchers, producers, and other stakeholders updated with the
    developments and assist them with the selection of the new sensors that would
    best suit their needs. Several review papers related to SWS in the context of
    United States (US) have been published in the past two decades. Most of these
    reviews have been focused on one of three areas: 1) soil water measurement technologies
    and underlying principles, 2) the advantages and disadvantages of different SWS
    technologies, and 3) how SWS accuracies change on a paper-to-paper basis. These
    review papers include Noborio (2001) and Robinson et al. (2003), which focused
    on time domain reflectometry, an emerging technology at that time that was receiving
    considerable attention from researchers. Later reviews by Evett and Parkin (2005),
    Robinson et al. (2008), Evett et al. (2012), Ochsner et al. (2013), and Cahn and
    Johnson (2017) provided discussions on more than one technology. Through evaluating
    previous review papers (listed above), three key limitations have been identified.
    Firstly, they did not summarize the findings of research studies in a way that
    could shed light on factors that influence SWS accuracy. Secondly, the majority
    of them did not go beyond the accuracy assessment and did not explore SWS utilization
    in practical irrigation scheduling. Finally, they did not review and compare scheduling
    based on SWS with other approaches. Addressing these three limitations in one
    paper requires an approach beyond traditional literature reviews. This is where
    systematic reviews have been proven successful by providing a more comprehensive
    and structured summary of the previous research studies (Aromataris and Pearson,
    2014). The goal of this systematic review was to identify and analyze related
    literature published in the past two decades on SWS and their applications in
    agricultural irrigation management and to provide future guidelines and directions
    for research and extension professionals, producers, government agencies, and
    other stakeholders. The specific objectives were: 1) to extract and summarize
    information on SWS accuracy and factors that influence accuracy, and 2) to review
    and synthesize information on SWS application in irrigation scheduling and how
    it compares with other approaches. The results of this systematic review highlight
    the aspects of SWS accuracy and utilization in irrigation scheduling that need
    more attention. Furthermore, this review could be useful policymakers to better
    prioritize and direct limited financial resources to promote SWS performance and
    use in irrigation scheduling. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Literature assimilation
    Two databases of Google Scholar and Scopus® were searched to identify previously
    published peer-reviewed journal manuscripts and conference papers related to SWS
    accuracy assessment and application in managing agricultural irrigation following
    the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
    guidelines (Page et al., 2021). The following keywords were used in the search
    process: soil sensor* irrigation, soil sensor* irrigation management, and soil
    sensor* irrigation scheduling. The asterisk truncation enabled the search engines
    to find both single and plural forms of a word in Scopus®. The resulting papers
    were screened based on the following criteria for inclusion: 1) papers published
    between January 2000 and July 2021; 2) studies conducted in the conterminous US;
    and 3) studies that either assessed the accuracy of one or more commercially available
    SWS for applications in agricultural irrigation scheduling or compared SWS-based
    irrigation scheduling with other scheduling methods or both. Exclusion criteria
    were: 1) review studies, theses, and dissertations and 2) SWS studies targeting
    greenhouse or landscape applications. A total of 165 papers were identified from
    the databases. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 80 papers
    were selected for the systematic review. Seventeen additional papers were identified
    from these 80 papers by forward and backward citation chasing (Cooper et al.,
    2018). Finally, 97 papers were identified from the PRISMA-guided literature search
    (Fig. 1): 49 papers on SWS accuracy assessment and 48 papers on SWS-based irrigation
    scheduling. Only one paper had both components. Download : Download high-res image

    flowchart of the systematic review on soil water sensors. 2.2. Information extraction
    The identified SWS papers were reviewed in detail and their findings were synthesized,
    organized, and presented under two focus areas of i) accuracy assessment and ii)
    application in irrigation scheduling. For the first focus area, a dataset was
    created consisting of twelve variables extracted from each of the 49 identified
    papers, if available. These variables were: 1) SWS technologies tested, 2) replications
    per sensor, 3) installation orientation (horizontal or vertical), 4) number of
    soil types considered, 5) study environment (field or laboratory), 6) SWS calibration
    used (factory or site-specific), 7) statistical error indicators reported (root
    mean square error, mean bias error, etc.), 8) number of locations where the statistical
    indicators were obtained, 9) reference method used to obtain the statistical indicators,
    10) study duration, 11) soil salinity, and 12) soil texture (percentages of sand,
    silt, and clay). We conducted a basic analysis on each of these twelve variables
    to obtain the proportions of the papers that reported each of these variables,
    the elements of each variable, and the range and mean of the variables or their
    elements (for example horizontal and vertical elements in case of installation
    orientation variable). In addition to the basic analysis, a detailed analysis
    was carried out on the error indicators evaluating the effects of four variables
    out of twelve that have been shown to have more influence on SWS accuracy: SWS
    technologies (Kukal et al., 2020), installation orientation (Chen et al., 2019),
    study environment (Feng and Sui, 2020), and calibrations (Chen et al., 2019, Singh
    et al., 2019). We extracted all error indicators for each of the four variables.
    Then, the error indicators were visualized through boxplots for each element of
    each variable. Since soil texture (especially clay content) also impacts the performance
    of many SWS (Datta et al., 2018, Singh et al., 2019), the results were presented
    separately for different ranges of clay content to allow for easier evaluation
    of the effects of studied variables under different levels of clay content. This
    way, the effects of differences in the four mentioned variables were compared
    when soil textures were somewhat similar. Based on the reported percentages in
    identified papers, four classes of clay content were considered for the detailed
    analysis: 0–22 %, 23–45 %, 46–69 %, and unreported. The ending number in each
    class included its fractions. Besides clay content, salinity is another variable
    that impacts SWS accuracy. But we did not include this variable in the detailed
    analysis as most of the identified papers did not report soil salinity. When discussing
    the results based on the root mean square error (RMSE), which was the most reported
    error indicator, classifications of two previous studies were used. Hignett and
    Evett (2008) suggested that SWS can be effective in irrigation scheduling if their
    RMSE is less than or equal to 0.02 m3 m−3. Fares et al. (2011) suggested the accuracy
    of SWS can be classified as good, fair, poor, and very poor for RMSE < 0.01, 0.01 ≤ RMSE < 0.05,
    0.05 ≤ RMSE < 0.10, and RMSE ≥ 0.10 m3 m−3, respectively. For the second focus
    area (applications in irrigation scheduling), another dataset was created consisting
    of six variables extracted from the 48 identified papers: 1) SWS technologies
    used, 2) cropping systems, 3) study duration, 4) study location, 5) farm ownership
    (commercial farm or research station), 6) other scheduling methods studied, and
    7) impacts of the studied scheduling methods on water use, yield, energy consumption,
    and net income. Like the accuracy assessment dataset, we presented descriptive
    statistics for each of these seven variables and their elements. Since different
    studies reported changes in water use, yield, energy consumption, and net income
    in different units, combining and comparing them required normalizing their results.
    To do so, the differences were first estimated by subtracting the value of the
    reported parameter based on other scheduling methods from its value for SWS-based
    method and then dividing the difference by the value based on the other scheduling
    method to obtain the percent increase or decrease in the parameter when SWS-based
    scheduling was used. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Accuracy assessment 3.1.1.
    Basic analysis The identified papers varied widely with respect to the twelve
    variables and their elements. The number of tested SWS technologies ranged from
    1 to 10, with a mean of 3 tested technologies in each paper. The number of replications
    had a range of 1–18 with a mean of 3. Installation orientation was reported in
    71 % of the papers. Similar number of papers reported horizontal (26 %) and vertical
    (25 %) installations, with 20 % of the papers using both orientations. The average
    number of soil types in each study was 3 (range of 1–9). Forty-seven percent of
    the papers determined SWS accuracy under field conditions, 43 % in laboratory,
    and the rest (10 %) in both field and laboratory. About half (51 %) of the papers
    used factory calibration in determining SWS accuracy, 14 % used site-specific
    calibration, and 35 % used both. Eighty percent of experiments were completed
    in one year, with maximum duration being 3 years (14 % of papers). A variety of
    error indicators were used to represent SWS accuracy. The two most common indicators
    were RMSE and mean bias error (MBE), reported in 76 % and 35 % of reviewed papers,
    respectively. Twenty-nine percent of papers reported both RMSE and MBE. Except
    for one paper that reported RMSE in units of soil matric potential and was excluded
    from the analyses, the units of RMSE and MBE were volumetric water content. Less
    common error indicators reported were relative RMSE, coefficient of determination,
    and absolute average difference. Based on frequency of use in identified papers,
    RMSE and MBE were selected for detailed analysis. Soil salinity was reported in
    only 18 % of the papers, with a range of 0–8.4 dS m−1 (1:1 soil-water ratio) and
    a mean of 1.8 dS m−1. Clay content was reported in 72 % of the papers (range of
    0–69 %). When considering all types of error indicators in the database, a total
    of 1510 error observations were reported to represent SWS accuracy. The number
    of error observations for each county in the conterminous US is shown in Fig.
    2. At the state level, Texas and Nebraska were the leading states with 32 % and
    26 % of the total observations, respectively. It is worth pointing out that many
    major irrigated areas in the south and west have no reported error indicator,
    so information is not available on how different SWS technologies perform there.
    This may have some negative impact on SWS adoption as an initial step in technology
    transfer is the trust of potential end-users in performance of that technology.
    Among the methods used as reference to estimate the error indicators, gravimetric
    sampling was the most common method, accounting for 51 % of the total observations,
    followed by neutron scattering (47 %). Other methods included tensiometry and
    time domain reflectometry. Download : Download high-res image (658KB) Download

    in the literature for each county in the conterminous US. 3.1.2. Detailed analysis
    3.1.2.1. Technology Eight different SWS technologies were used in accuracy assessment
    studies: amplitude domain reflectometry, time domain reflectometry (TDR), frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR), time domain transmissometry, electrical resistivity
    (ER), suction in soil matrix, heat pulse, and neutron scattering. The terms FDR
    and capacitance have been used interchangeably by many researchers as they are
    based on similar technologies (Hignett and Evett, 2008). Therefore, these two
    technologies are referred to as FDR in this paper. Three of the eight mentioned
    technologies dominated the reported error indicators: TDR (45 % and 41 % of all
    reported RMSE and MBE, respectively), FDR (43 % and 39 %, respectively), and ER
    (8 % and 16 %, respectively). Therefore, the emphasis of this detailed analysis
    is on these three technologies. Moreover, the analysis looked at RMSE and MBE
    resulting from factory calibrated SWS readings to keep the comparison among these
    technologies fair. This would also make the findings more useful to practical
    end-users who may not have resources to conduct site-specific calibration (e.g.,
    producers and farm managers). The mean RMSE among the three technologies were
    similar at 0.07–0.08 m3 m−3. The ranges of RMSE for TDR, FDR, and ER were somewhat
    different at 0–0.40, 0.01–0.52, and 0.02–0.21 m3 m−3, respectively. The maximum
    RMSE of 0.52 m3 m−3 for FDR was due to the combined effects of high clay content
    and salinity. The smaller range of ER compared to the other two technologies may
    be due to the smaller size of RMSE observations and thus less exposure to variable
    environmental conditions. Zero, 6 %, and 16 % of the RMSEs reported for ER, FDR,
    and TDR technologies were smaller than the threshold set by Hignett and Evett
    (2008), respectively. This means that based on their standard, only a small portion
    of cases (none for ER) met the irrigation scheduling requirements. According to
    less-strict thresholds of Fares et al. (2011), the percentages of errors falling
    under good or fair classes were larger at 50 % for TDR, 46 % for FDR, and 44 %
    for ER. The mean MBE for TDR, FDR, and ER were 0.02, 0.03, and − 0.04 m3 m−3,
    respectively. In general, the errors did not seem to increase with clay content
    (Fig. 3). The largest mean and median RMSE and MBE were typically found in the
    medium clay content level (23–45 %). Download : Download high-res image (143KB)

    The numbers within the plot represent the number of observations used to produce
    the corresponding box. The total number of observations for RMSE and MBE was 637
    and 289, respectively. 3.1.2.2. Installation orientation Some previous researchers
    have found different accuracies in response to installation orientation. For instance,
    Zhu et al. (2019) reported smaller errors for horizontally installed SWS in Nebraska
    compared to vertical orientation. Chen et al. (2019) found similar results in
    Texas. Both studies speculated the reason could be due to a vertical soil temperature
    gradient that was not accurately captured in vertical installation since the temperature
    was measured at one point in the head of the sensor. This systematic review, however,
    did not support those findings. The mean RMSE was the same (0.06 m3 m−3) for both
    orientations. The ranges of RMSE were also close at 0–0.40 and 0–0.35 m3 m−3 for
    horizontal and vertical orientations, respectively. Twenty-seven and 21 % of RMSE
    obtained under horizontal and vertical orientations were smaller than the thresholds
    of Hignett and Evett (2008). According to Fares et al. (2011), 56 % of RMSE fell
    under good or fair classes for both orientations. Like RMSE, the mean MBE were
    the same (0.01 m3 m−3). However, the range of MBE for horizontal orientation was
    larger (− 0.54 to 0.56 m3 m−3) than that of vertical orientation (− 0.16 to 0.24 m3
    m−3). This may be because 99 % of the horizontal observations were obtained under
    field conditions, compared to 57 % of the vertical orientation, and thus were
    more exposed to variable conditions of outdoor environment. No obvious relationship
    between error indicators and levels of clay content was observed (Fig. 4). There
    were no MBE reported for clay content level of 46–69 %. Download : Download high-res

    the plot represent the number of observations used to produce the corresponding
    box. The total number of observations for RMSE and MBE was 683 and 367, respectively.
    3.1.2.3. Environment The mean RMSE was the same (0.06 m3 m−3) for both field and
    laboratory environments, but the range was smaller for field (0–0.40 m3 m−3) than
    laboratory (0–0.52 m3 m−3). The maximum RMSE of 0.52 m3 m−3 under laboratory was
    reported by Vaz et al. (2013) and was due to combined effects of high clay content
    and salinity. Ignoring this value, the range was 0–0.35 m3 m−3, closer to (and
    smaller than) that of field RMSE. According to thresholds by Hignett and Evett
    (2008), only 18 % and 28 % of the reported RMSE from field and laboratory were
    considered appropriate for irrigation scheduling. Based on thresholds set by Fares
    et al. (2011), 56 % and 68 % of RMSE obtained from field and laboratory were considered
    as good or fair, respectively. Like RMSE, the mean MBE for field and laboratory
    were similar (0.01 m3 m−3), with a range of − 0.54 to 0.56 m3 m−3 for field and
    a smaller range of − 0.06 to 0.24 m3 m−3 for laboratory. Analyzing the results
    for different levels of clay content showed that the median field RMSE was smaller
    than median laboratory RMSE only for the lowest clay content level (Fig. 5). Download

    The numbers within the plot represent the number of observations used to produce
    the corresponding box. The total number of observations for RMSE and MBE was 957
    and 466, respectively. 3.1.2.4. Calibration Factory calibration was used more
    commonly than site-specific calibration, accounting for 69 % and 64 % of all RMSE
    and MBE estimates, respectively. The mean RMSE of factory calibration was 0.07 m3
    m−3, about three times larger than site-specific calibration (0.02 m3 m−3). The
    range of RMSE for factory calibration was also about four times larger (0–0.52 m3
    m−3) than site-specific calibration (0–0.13 m3 m−3). This was expected as the
    estimates based on site-specific calibration are tuned for unique conditions of
    the installation site, generated with the goal of producing smaller errors. Only
    11 % of the RMSE obtained using factory calibration was suitable for irrigation
    scheduling according to threshold of Hignett and Evett (2008), compared to 48 %
    in case of site-specific calibration. A similar trend was observed based on classification
    of Fares et al. (2011), with 49 % and 91 % of factory and site-specific RMSE falling
    under good or fair classes, respectively. The mean MBE obtained from factory calibration
    was also larger (0.02 m3 m−3) than site-specific (− 0.01 m3 m−3). The range of
    MBE using factory calibration was larger (− 0.54 to 0.56 m3 m−3) than that of
    site-specific calibration (− 0.39 to 0.08 m3 m−3). The superiority of site-specific
    calibration was evident when analyzing error indicators for different levels of
    clay content (Fig. 6). In case of RMSE, the mean, median, and range were notably
    larger for factory calibration at all clay levels. The average improvement in
    RMSE going from factory to site-specific calibration was 216 %. Like RMSE, the
    mean, median, and range of MBE were considerably larger based on factory calibration.
    The accuracy improvement using site-specific calibration has been well-documented
    in previous studies (e.g., Dong et al., 2020; Kukal et al., 2020). They recommended
    using SWS with site-specific calibration to obtain more accurate estimates of
    soil water content. However, end-users seldom have technical and financial resources
    to do site-specific calibration. Download : Download high-res image (126KB) Download

    number of observations used to produce the corresponding box. The total number
    of observations for RMSE and MBE was 957 and 466, respectively. 3.2. Applications
    in irrigation scheduling Six different SWS technologies were implemented in irrigation
    scheduling studies: ER, FDR, TDR, neutron probe, tensiometer, and time domain
    transmissometry. ER accounted for 33 % of the cases, followed by FDR (21 %), neutron
    probe (16 %), and TDR (13 %). The other two technologies comprised of 17 % of
    the cases combined. The main reasons behind dominant use of ER in irrigation scheduling
    could be its lower cost, ease of use, and ease of data interpretation. In addition,
    many extension factsheets and user manuals have been developed since the earlier
    versions of the ER technology (gypsum blocks) were developed several decades ago.
    Among cropping systems where irrigation scheduling methods were tested, corn and
    cotton were the most dominant. Other notable crops were tomato, soybean, watermelon,
    sugar beet, sorghum, and potato. The length of the study period in identified
    papers ranged from 1 to 6 years, with a mean of 2 years. A total of 64 locations
    where irrigation scheduling by SWS was investigated were identified. Fig. 7 presents
    the county-wise number of locations in the conterminous US. At the state level,
    Nebraska was the lead with 22 % of the locations, followed by Texas (17 %), Mississippi
    (13 %), and Florida (13 %). About 13 % of irrigation scheduling studies were conducted
    at commercial fields of producers and the rest (87 %) at research farms owned
    by universities or research institutions. Like the spatial pattern of SWS accuracy
    assessment studies, many major irrigated areas (especially in western US) had
    no reported study on SWS utilization for irrigation scheduling. Download : Download

    where irrigation scheduling application of SWS has been studied for each county
    in the conterminous US. Among the identified papers, 40 % relied only on the SWS
    method and the rest compared it with other scheduling methods, including traditional,
    computer models, evapotranspiration replacement, and canopy temperature. The traditional
    scheduling included producers’ practices and approaches to deciding when and how
    much to irrigate, as well as rotational delivery by water provider. Computer models
    included simple soil water balance models executed through spreadsheets and checkbooks,
    advanced simulation models (e.g., CERES-Maize), and mobile- and web-based applications
    such as Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler, SmartIrrigation Cotton App, and Irrigator
    Pro. The evapotranspiration replacement approach relied on reports of crop water
    use obtained from local weather stations, with the amount of irrigation water
    being equal to the cumulative evapotranspiration since the last irrigation event.
    The canopy temperature method was based on the thermal remote sensing of crop
    canopy. The SWS-based irrigation scheduling was compared with the traditional
    method more commonly than any other method, followed by computer models and evapotranspiration
    replacement (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (47KB) Download : Download

    respectively, while 2 % documented changes in energy consumption and 6 % reported
    changes in net income. Only one paper (Irmak et al., 2012) reported all four parameters.

    the plot represent the number of observations used to produce the corresponding
    box. The total number of observations was 32. On average, SWS-based scheduling
    used 38 % less water than traditional, 16 % less water than computer models, 20 %
    less water than evapotranspiration replacement, and 1 % less water than canopy
    temperature methods. Several reasons could explain the smaller water use of the
    SWS-based method. Steele et al. (2000) mentioned that SWS-based irrigation scheduling
    used less water because of its real-time monitoring of crop water use compared
    to the methods that lack continuous monitoring. Muñoz-Carpena et al. (2008) attributed
    smaller water use in SWS-based compared to traditional scheduling to smaller irrigation
    amounts early in the growing season. Ganjegunte and Clark (2017) observed both
    smaller amounts and fewer irrigation events in SWS-based scheduling compared to
    traditional scheduling. Overall, SWS-based scheduling resulted in larger yield
    (9 % on average) when considering all of the methods it was compared against.
    The largest increase in yield (24 %) was observed when SWS-based scheduling was
    compared against traditional scheduling. SWS-based scheduling had 7 % larger yield
    on average compared to evapotranspiration replacement. Computer models and canopy
    temperature methods had somewhat similar yield to the SWS-based scheduling method
    (within 2–3 %). In the reviewed papers, the overall goal of using various irrigation
    scheduling methods has been to minimize irrigation amounts and optimize irrigation
    frequency to meet a target crop yield that is generally obtained from traditional
    scheduling method. Thus, increasing yield through other scheduling methods is
    often viewed as a secondary objective in these studies, especially those conducted
    in the drought-stricken or water-limited areas. This may explain the smaller magnitude
    of differences in yield compared to differences in water use when comparing SWS-based
    scheduling with other scheduling methods. 4. Conclusions A systematic review was
    carried out to identify and analyze relevant literature on the use of SWS for
    irrigation scheduling in the US between 2000 and 2021. The analysis was concentrated
    on two focus areas: SWS accuracy assessment and SWS application in irrigation
    scheduling. With respect to accuracy assessment, most of the studies were conducted
    in Texas and Nebraska, while many other states with vast irrigated areas had no
    published study. Gravimetric sampling and neutron scattering were two most common
    methods of reference to estimate SWS errors. The three dominant technologies (TDR,
    FDR, and ER) had similar average RMSE and did not show any trend in errors with
    increasing clay content. Similarly, installing sensors horizontally or vertically
    and under field or laboratory conditions did not impact the average RMSE and no
    trend with increasing clay content was found. Not surprisingly, the average RMSE
    for factory (manufacturer) calibration was three times larger than the average
    RMSE based on site-specific calibration, and this was the case for each class
    of clay content. Like accuracy assessment, TDR, FDR, and ER were the dominant
    technologies used in irrigation scheduling. Texas and Nebraska were the leading
    states in this focus area as well. Many states in western US did not have a single
    paper in the past two decades on practical application of SWS for irrigation scheduling.
    Nearly all papers that compared SWS-based scheduling with other methods reported
    changes in water use and yield, two of the most important metrics in evaluating
    the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling methods. Making irrigation decisions
    based on SWS resulted in average reductions in water use of 38 % compared to traditional
    scheduling methods, 16 % compared to computer models, 20 % compared to evapotranspiration
    replacement, and 1 % compared to canopy temperature methods. The savings in water
    use were achieved while the yields improved (24 % compared to traditional methods)
    or remained about the same. This systematic review presented the state of the
    art of the accuracy and application of SWS in irrigation scheduling in the US
    in the last 20 years. With regular releases of new sensors and modifications of
    older ones, our recommendations for future SWS studies are to: 1) continue testing
    new sensors and models soon after they become available to provide accuracy assessments
    in a timely manner; 2) conduct more accuracy assessment studies under field conditions
    and in major irrigated areas and states that did not have a single experiment
    in the past 20 years; 3) report soil texture, soil salinity, and RMSE whenever
    possible to make the results more comparable and transferrable; 4) develop more
    site-specific calibrations for commercially-available SWS (we also strongly encourage
    SWS manufacturers to provide a library of calibrations or allow users to enter
    their own calibration); and 5) to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of
    utilizing SWS for scientific irrigation scheduling by documenting the improvements
    in water use, yield, energy consumption, and net income, which are necessary for
    decision makers and producers to support and adopt SWS technologies. The results
    of such studies may be more acceptable to end-users if the experiments are designed
    and conducted in collaboration with local producers and early adopters. Authorship

    methods have been widely used to predict crop types according to UAV remote sensing
    imagery, which has excellent local feature extraction capabilities. However, its

    the imagery. A new feature-fusion module was designed to flexibly aggregate the
    multi-scale global and local features from the two branches. Finally, the FPNHead
    of feature pyramid network served as the decoder for the improved adaptation to
    the multi-scale fused features and output the crop-type segmentation results.
    Our comprehensive experiments indicated that the proposed CTFuseNet achieved a

    for crop-type segmentation, revealing the advantage of fusing the features found
    by the CNN and the transformer. Further work is needed to promote accuracy and

    1. Introduction Global food security is a worldwide issue and presents serious
    challenges. Precision agriculture is crucial to ensuring food security, as well
    as the social and economic development [1]. Accurate and timely crop-type-segmentation
    information facilitates the precision agriculture activities, e.g., irrigation
    scheduling, yield estimation, land use assessment, as well as governmental agricultural
    policy decisions [2]. As compared to the manual surveys that consume a large amount
    of human and material resources, remote sensing is capable of acquiring information
    in a rapid, large-scale, non-destructive way and has been involved in various
    fields, e.g., crop biomass estimation, crop yield estimation, crop area estimation,
    plant protection, and agricultural disaster prediction [3]. In addition to spaceborne
    and airborne platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently emerged
    as effective tools for agriculture monitoring. UAVs are able to fly at low altitudes
    and obtain images with very high spatial resolution and are not affected by clouds
    [4]. Due to these outstanding advantages, UAVs have been applied in agricultural
    applications, such as weed mapping [5], insect detection [6], plant disease detection
    [7], crop yield prediction [8], etc. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as
    maximum likelihood [9], support vector machines [10], and random forests [11],
    have long been applied in a variety of agriculture applications to construct linear
    or non-linear patterns and correlations from samples. A typical ML-based crop-type-segmentation
    pipeline includes the study area selection, data acquisition, data preprocessing,
    feature selection or transformation, and the application of ML algorithms. However,
    the performance of ML-based methods relies heavily on handcrafted feature extraction
    techniques and expertise. Deep-learning (DL) models have demonstrated superior
    performance in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, over traditional machine-learning
    algorithms in complex tasks, due to their powerful automatic feature extraction
    and non-linear expression capabilities. In the past years, DL has achieved success
    in various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, etc.,
    as well as in the remote sensing community. Early attempts demonstrated that crop-type
    determination using DL-based image classification algorithms could achieve high
    accuracy [12,13]. However, DL-based image classification could only determine
    the type of the input images and often required classification with a sliding
    window on large-scale images to generate crop maps, which limits its efficiency.
    Meanwhile, semantic segmentation predicts the class of each pixel for the images,
    which is more accurate and efficient for crop type mapping. Since the fully convolutional
    network (FCN) [14] first expanded the use of end-to-end convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) for semantic segmentation, the accuracy of image semantic segmentation
    has been continuously improved, and many advanced CNN-based semantic segmentation
    networks, e.g., SegNet [15], U-Net [16] and DeepLab [17] have been proposed. Research
    on crop-type segmentation on UAV remote sensing images is emerging [18,19] and
    becoming mainstream. These networks are typically using an encoder–decoder architecture,
    which uses CNNs for feature extraction in the encoder and pixel-level class segmentation
    in the decoder. In the feature extraction of the encoder, the contextual information
    of an image is crucial [20,21]. However, due to the limitation of the receptive
    field of CNNs [22], only limited contextual information can be processed, and
    the restriction of long-range scene perception of the full image may lead to the
    wrong categorization of the crop field when processed by segmentation networks.
    In recent years, an attention mechanism that allocates limited attention resources
    to quickly filter valuable information has been widely applied in the field of
    computer vision, including such methods as CBAM [23], SENet [24], and GSoP [25]
    for CNNs. Recently, transformers with an architecture based on an self-attention
    mechanism proposed by Google have achieved state-of-the-art results in natural
    language processing [26]. Dosovitskiy et al. proposed a vision transformer (ViT)
    based on the concept of transformers, in which they had replaced the CNN architecture
    with a self-attentive mechanism and attained excellent results in computer vision
    tasks [27]. A transformer was able to extract the global features of images, and
    transformer-based semantic segmentation algorithms such as SETR [21], SegFormer
    [28], and Swin Transformer [29] have achieved state-of-the-art results and been
    applied in remote sensing applications, such as land-cover mapping [30]. However,
    when applying a transformer-based networks to crop-type segmentation with UAV
    remote sensing images directly, satisfactory results can not always be obtained
    mainly due to the following reasons. Spatial information and local features, e.g.,
    edge details, color, texture and shape of crops, in remote sensing images are
    crucial factors affecting the semantic segmentation results [31]. However, a transformer
    divides the high-resolution UAV imagery into patches, which may lead to an incomplete
    structure of crop-field edges [32]. In addition, transformers compress the image
    into one-dimensional tokens and send them to the transformer encoder as a sequence,
    which then leads to the loss of spatial information and local information. This
    is not conducive to recovering the detailed information in the decoder stage of
    semantic segmentation networks, resulting in a decrease in the accuracy [33].
    Recently, there have been a few attempts to use CNNs and transformers simultaneously
    for crop type mapping. Li et al. [34] combined the ability of a CNN to express
    spatial and spectral correlations of remote sensing images with that of a transformer
    to obtain temporal correlations, and they installed a CNN and a transformer on
    the same processing flow. Wang et al. [32] designed a coupled CNN–transformer
    network using different feature-fusion modules for different resolutions and additional
    loss functions during the model training process. In the wider range of areas
    for remote sensing image interpretation, more research towards combining CNN and
    transformer architectures to improve performance have been conducted, such as
    for object detection [35], image pan-sharpening [36], SAR image classification
    [37], and fine-grained ship classification [38]. In these studies, combining a
    CNN and a transformer to take advantage of both methods’ benefits is challenging.
    Typically, the features extracted by the CNN have been fed into the transformer,
    or vice versa. Meanwhile, the separate global and local feature extraction processes
    provide the flexibility to switch backbone networks and use their pre-trained
    weights. However, fully aggregating and decoding the global and local features
    is difficult. In computer vision, there have been efforts in aggregating and decoding
    local and global features to improve performance. For the CNN-based semantic segmentation,
    U-Net [16] used concatenation and deconvolution to aggregate features at different
    scales while PSPNet [39] and DeepLabV3+ [40] employed pyramid-structured decoders
    to aggregate and decode features at various scales. For the transformer-based
    semantic segmentation, SegFormer [28] integrated a lightweight decoder composed
    of various multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and a Swin transformer [29] utilized
    UperHead from UperNet [41] to aggregate the self-attention generated from windows
    of different sizes. The aforementioned works that aggregated local features from
    CNNs and global features from transformers are discussed in Section 5.3. Therefore,
    in this study, we proposed an end-to-end CNN–transformer feature-fused network
    (CTFuseNet) to achieve accurate crop-type segmentation in order to solve the main
    issues, as previously mentioned: (1) CNN-based crop segmentation methods lack
    long-range contextual information, which may lead to the wrong categorization
    of the crop field; (2) transformer-based methods slice the high-resolution UAV
    imagery into patches, which may lead to the loss of spatial information; and (3)
    fully extracting, aggregating and decoding the multi-scale global and local features
    with a transformer and a CNN has yet to be fully examined. Comprehensive experiments
    with advanced segmentation networks including U-Net, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, DANet,
    OCRNet, SETR and SegFormer, as well as the performance analysis of the proposed
    module, were conducted. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the
    proposed method. Specifically, the main contributions of this paper are listed,
    as follows: We proposed CTFuseNet, a global–local feature-fused network based
    on transformer and CNN architectures for accurate crop-type segmentation. It provides
    a parallel structure of CNN and transformer branches in the encoder to extract
    both local and global semantic features of remote sensing imagery and outputs
    multi-scale features for aggregation. We design a new lightweight feature-fusion
    module to flexibly aggregate the multi-scale local and global features output
    from CNN and transformer branches in the proposed CTFuseNet. The FPNHead from
    feature pyramid network servers as the decoder in the proposed CTFuseNet, instead
    of maintaining the original All-MLP decoder in SegFormer. It allows decoding features
    at different scales, thus adapting to the fused features and further improving
    the accuracy. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the
    proposed CTFuseNet is presented, including the parallel structure of CNN and transformer
    branches in the encoder, the feature-fusion module, and the decoder for the multi-scale
    global–local features. The study area, the dataset, the experimental settings,
    and the methods for performance comparison are provided in Section 3. The experimental
    results and the comprehensive analysis are presented in Section 4. The discussion
    about the proposed method is given in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn
    in Section 6. 2. Methodology The proposed end-to-end CNN–transformer feature-fused
    network (CTFuseNet) for crop-type semantic segmentation had three major components:
    a parallel structure of a CNN and a transformer to extract multi-scale local and
    global features in the encoder, a newly designed multi-scale feature-fusion module,
    and the FPNHead from the feature pyramid network that served as the decoder and
    output the crop-type segmentation results. The overall architecture of the proposed
    network is shown in Figure 1. The following subsections describe the proposed
    method in detail. Figure 1. The framework of the proposed CTFuseNet for accurate
    crop-type segmentation. 2.1. Parallel Structure of CNN and Transformer for Local
    and Global Feature Extraction As shown in the upper part of Figure 1, the proposed
    CTFuseNet consisted of a parallel structure of CNN and transformer branches. The
    CNN branch was designed to extract the local details of the remote sensing images.
    In this paper, ResNet [42], a CNN-based image classification network, was used
    as the feature extraction backbone in the CNN branch. It should be noted that
    the CNN branch enabled the integration of state-of-the-art CNNs to enhance performance.
    The ResNet was composed of several residual blocks called bottlenect, which contain
    a residual structure that utilized shortcut connections to transfer features from
    shallow layers to deep layers and resolved the degradation issue in deep CNN networks.
    According to the combinations of the bottleneck number in Layers 1–4, the ResNet
    could be divided into ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152, for
    example, the number of bottlenecks in Layers 1–4 of ResNet50 was 3, 4, 6, and
    3, respectively. In the CNN branch of the proposed network in this paper, a remote
    sensing image of 𝐻×𝑊×3 (H and W represent the resolution of the input image, and
    the number of channels of RGB images was 3) was first processed into a 𝐻 2 × 𝑊
    2 ×64 feature map by Stem (composed of conv and activation functions) and Maxpool,
    and the features were extracted at different levels through four layers. Each
    layer downsampled the input feature map and input it into several bottleneck structures,
    for example, the input of Layer 2 was 𝐻 4 × 𝑊 4 ×𝐶 and the output was 𝐻 8 × 𝑊
    8 ×2𝐶 . Finally, four feature maps are obtained, and their resolutions and channel
    numbers were 𝐻 4 × 𝑊 4 , 𝐻 8 × 𝑊 8 , 𝐻 16 × 𝑊 16 , 𝐻 32 × 𝑊 32 , and C, 2𝐶 , 4𝐶
    , 8𝐶 , respectively. These four feature maps with different resolutions and a
    different number of channels supported the network in order to model local features
    at different scales. As shown in the bottom part of Figure 1, the transformer
    branch in the CTFuseNet was designed to extract the global contextual information
    of remote sensing images. In this paper, SegFormer [28], a state-of-the-art transformer-based
    segmentation network, was adopted in the transformer branch. The encoder of SegFormer
    used a hierarchical transformer encoder without position encoding, and its encoder
    structure is shown in Figure 1. In the transformer branch with SegFormer, a remote
    sensing image of 𝐻×𝑊×3 was first divided into a series of 4×4 patches as an input
    feature sequence, which are called tokens, and then the transformer encoder was
    used to extract the global features of input tokens. Finally, four feature maps
    of different scales and with resolutions, such as 𝐻 4 × 𝑊 4 , 𝐻 8 × 𝑊 8 , 𝐻 16
    × 𝑊 16 and 𝐻 32 × 𝑊 32 , were obtained. The transformer feature-extraction stage
    consisted of a patch-embedding module for dividing the input images into patches,
    and a transformer encoder consisting of four transformer blocks, which is shown
    in Figure 1. Each transformer block extracted the deep global features of the
    input features and reduced the resolution to 1 2 of the original. Each transformer
    block contained several self-attention calculation modules and Mix-FNN modules,
    and a patch-merging module, which were detailed, as follows. The formula of self-attention
    calculation module in the original ViT [27] proposed by Dosovitskiy et al. is
    shown as Equation (1). On this basis, the self-attention calculation module in
    SegFormer performed a reshape operation on K to reduce the computational complexity.
    Its formula is shown as Equations (2) and (3). Attention(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=Softmax( 𝑄 𝐾 ⊤
    𝑑 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 − − − − √ )𝑉 (1) 𝐾 ̂ =Reshape( 𝑁 𝑅 ,𝐶·𝑅)(𝐾) (2) 𝐾 𝑛𝑒𝑤 =Linear(𝐶·𝑅,𝐶)( 𝐾
    ̂ ) (3) where K is the input sequence to be reshaped, N is the length of the input
    feature sequence, C is the channel number of the feature sequence, and R is the
    ratio of the Reshape operation. In addition, Reshape( 𝑁 𝑅 ,𝐶·𝑅)(𝐾) refers to reshaping
    K to the shape of 𝑁 𝑅 ×(𝐶·𝑅) , and Linear(𝐶·𝑅,𝐶)( 𝐾 ̂ ) refers to linear transformation
    of K. The mix-FFN module was used to replace the positional encoding in ViT to
    obtain the spatial information of the input image. The formula is as follows:
    𝑥 𝑜𝑢𝑡 =MLP(GELU(Conv(MLP( 𝑥 𝑖𝑛 ))))+ 𝑥 𝑖𝑛 (4) where 𝑥 𝑖𝑛 is the input features
    from self-attention calculation module, and GELU is the activation function. The
    Conv is a convolutional operation with a kernel size of 3×3 . The patch-merging
    module restored the feature sequence in the form of a one-dimensional token to
    a feature map with the shape of 𝐻 2 𝑖+1 × 𝑊 2 𝑖+1 × 𝐶 𝑖 , where i denotes the
    i-th layer. 2.2. Multi-Scale Feature-Fusion Module The multi-scale feature-fusion
    module was designed to aggregate the local features from the CNN branch and the
    global features from the transformer branch. It efficiently and flexibly fused
    the features with different resolutions and channel numbers, and its structure
    is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. The structure of the proposed feature-fusion module.
    In the feature-fusion module, the features extracted by CNN and transformer (named
    C and T) were first passed through a convolutional network with a kernel size
    of 1×1 , respectively, to adjust their dimensions. The concatenation was then
    performed to merge C and T. In this stage, the features merged by the concatenation
    were separated into a third dimension. The merged features were fed into a 1×1
    convolution, followed by a normalization operation and an activation function.
    Finally, the features from the CNN and transformer branches were fully fused through
    a layer of 1×1 convolution. In addition, a residual operation was used to accelerate
    the convergence of the model. 2.3. FPNHead for Multi-Scale Feature Decoding In
    the proposed CTFuseNet in Figure 1, four features extracted through CNN with the
    resolution of 𝐻 4 × 𝑊 4 , 𝐻 8 × 𝑊 8 , 𝐻 16 × 𝑊 16 , and 𝐻 32 × 𝑊 32 (C1, C2, C3,
    and C4, respectively), and four features extracted from transformer with the same
    resolution (T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively) were obtained. The features with
    the same resolution were fused separately, and finally four fusion features (F1,
    F2, F3, and F4, respectively) were obtained. SegFormer originally designed a lightweight
    All-MLP decoder, i.e., MLPHead that is capable of extracting the global feature
    and contextual information for a transformer. However, the fused features in the
    CTFuseNet contained both information extracted from the transformer and the CNN.
    Meanwhile, the feature pyramid network [43] was first designed to parse the different
    levels of contextual information from the CNN with different receptive fields
    for object detection.Considering its effectiveness on decoding features of low-resolution,
    semantically strong features and high-resolution, semantically weak features,
    it had been adapted to a semantic segmentation network [44]. Therefore, in this
    paper, the FPNHead from the feature pyramid network served as the decoder for
    the local features and global fusion features in the proposed CTFuseNet. Its structure
    is shown on the right of Figure 1. For features F1, F2, and F3 with a spatial
    resolution less than 𝐻 4 × 𝑊 4 , several scale heads were performed to restore
    their spatial resolution to 𝐻 4 × 𝑊 4 . Subsequently, four feature maps with the
    same resolution were integrated in order to finally create the prediction map,
    which was generated through a 1×1 convolution. 2.4. Objective Function The proposed
    CTFuseNet used the cross-entropy loss 𝐿 𝐶𝐸 to optimize its performance, as shown
    in Equation (5), where N is the number of pixels in the image, C is the number
    of classes, 𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 is the ground-truth label for the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ pixel and 𝑐 𝑡ℎ class,
    and 𝑝 𝑖,𝑐 is the predicted probability for the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ pixel and 𝑐 𝑡ℎ class. The
    objective function was used to minimize the cross-entropy loss 𝐿 𝐶𝐸 . 𝐿 𝐶𝐸 =−
    ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 ∑ 𝑐=1 𝐶 𝑦 𝑖,𝑐 log( 𝑝 𝑖,𝑐 ) (5) 3. Dataset and Experimental Settings 3.1.
    Study Area and Dataset The benchmark dataset in this paper was the barley remote
    sensing dataset (Barley dataset) derived from the UAV remote sensing images of
    a barley cultivation site in Xingren City, Guizhou Province, provided by “2019
    County Agricultural brain AI challenge” on the Alibaba Cloud Tianchi Platform
    [45]. Xingren City is located between 104°54 ′ –105°34 ′ E and 25°18 ′ –25°47
    ′ N, in Qianxinan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefectures, Guizhou Province (as
    shown in Figure 3). The climate of Xingren City is suitable for the growth of
    corn, flue-cured tobacco, barley, and other crops. Figure 3. The study area in
    this paper. The dataset contained 4 labeled RGB images, with sizes of 44,343×3360
    , 18,576×68,363 , 44,647×32,881 and 55,128×49,447 pixels. The labels were given
    in the form of single channel images, and the value of each pixel corresponded
    to the category of crops in the RGB images. Specifically, the pixel value of “flue-cured
    tobacco” was 1, “corn” was 2, “barley” was 3, “building” was 4, and all other
    positions were regarded as \"other\" with pixel value of 0 (as shown in Figure
    4). Table 1 shows the dataset information in detail. Figure 4. A panoramic view
    of the dataset. The top row is the RGB UAV remote sensing image, and the bottom
    row is the corresponding label. Table 1. Detail of the benchmark Barley dataset.
    3.2. Data Preprocessing To facilitate the training and testing of the Barley dataset,
    we cropped the original 4 large-scale images with a sliding window without overlapping,
    and the crop size was 512×512 . Subsequently, we sliced out the fully transparent
    images and obtained 13,037 labeled 512×512 UAV remote sensing images. Finally,
    we divided the training and testing data by the ratio of 8:2 , that is, 10,429
    for training and 2608 for testing. Figure 5 shows examples of the cropped remote
    sensing images and their corresponding labels. To further enhance the diversity
    of training data, we performed data augmentation during model training, including
    random cropping, scaling, and flipping, as well as photometric distortions, such
    as changes in brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and random light noise. Figure

    row is the corresponding label, in which black represents the background, red
    represents flue-cured tobacco, green represents corn, blue represents barley,
    and gray represents building. 3.3. Experimental Setup The hardware platform included
    an Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 CPU (https://www.intel.sg/content/www/xa/en/products/sku/91754/intel-xeon-processor-e52680-v4-35m-cache-2-40-ghz/specifications.html
    (accessed on 17 February 2023)), 64G of RAM, and an NVIDIA RTX3090 (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090-3090ti
    (accessed on 17 February 2023)) graphics card with 24G of video memory. The software
    platform was Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA11.1, Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.8.1 installed.
    For the network training, we use the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 8 and
    an initial learning rate of 0.0001 . The learning rate decayed by 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎 every
    10 epochs, and the value of the 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎 was set to 0.5 . At the same time, in order
    to avoid over-fitting, the dropout ratio was set to 0.1 . 3.4. Evaluation Criteria
    Mean intersection over union (mIoU) and pixel accuracy (PA), which are commonly
    used evaluation metrics for semantic segmentation [46,47], were adopted to evaluate
    the precision of the crop-type segmentation in our experiment. Accordingly, 𝑚𝐼𝑜𝑈
    calculated the ratio of the intersection and the concatenation of the actual values
    and the predicted values, so it was able to capture both the precision and the
    recall in a single score, and its formula is shown below. 𝑚𝐼𝑜𝑈= 1 𝑘+1 ∑ 𝑖=0 𝑘
    𝑃 𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑘 𝑗=0 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 + ∑ 𝑘 𝑗=0 𝑃 𝑗𝑖 − 𝑃 𝑖𝑖 (6) where k represents the number of crop-type
    segmentation categories, 𝑃 𝑖𝑖 indicates the number of pixels correctly predicted,
    and 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 represents the number of pixels whose actual value is i but predicted
    to be j. In addition, 𝑃𝐴 is the ratio of the number of correctly predicted pixels
    to the total number of pixels, and its formula is shown below. 𝑃𝐴= ∑ 𝑘 𝑖=0 𝑃 𝑖𝑖
    ∑ 𝑘 𝑖=0 ∑ 𝑘 𝑗=0 𝑃 𝑖𝑗 (7) 3.5. Methods for Performance Comparison In this paper,
    we compared the proposed CTFuseNet with seven advanced semantic segmentation methods
    listed below. For DANet, DeepLabV3+, and PSPNet, ResNet50 was utilized as the
    backbone. For SegFormer, to balance the computational complexity and precision,
    SegFormer-B3 was used as the backbone. For our proposed CTFuseNet, ResNet50 and
    SegFormer-B3 were used as the two-branched feature-extraction backbones. U-Net
    [16] uses a U-shaped structured network to propagate contextual information from
    low-resolution layers to high-resolution layers via upsampling. PSPNet [39] exploits
    the capability of global contextual information by different region-based contextual
    aggregation through a pyramid pooling module. DeepLabV3+ [40] is the latest version
    of the DeepLab series networks, which uses atrous convolution to expand the receptive
    field and depth-wise separable convolution to improve feature-extraction efficiency.
    DANet [48] models semantic information using attention mechanism in both spatial
    and channel dimensions. OCRNet [49] explicitly transforms the pixel classification
    problem into an object–region classification problem using the object–contextual-representations
    approach. SETR [21] is a transformer-based network that replaces CNN completely
    with self-attention modules. SegFormer [28] is a simple and efficient, yet powerful,
    semantic segmentation network that is based on a transformer. 4. Results and Analysis
    4.1. Crop-Type Segmentation Performance The segmentation accuracy of the proposed
    CTFuseNet and those of all the models used for comparison are shown in Table 2.
    Examples of the segmentation results are shown in Figure 6. Taking mIoU as the
    main indicator, the U-Net, based on the CNN architecture of an encoder–decoder,
    achieved a score of 78.73%. The DANet, DeepLabV3+, PSPNe, and OCRNet, which introduced
    attention mechanism and integrated multi-scale features, improved the segmentation
    accuracy of U-Net by 6.2%, 5.8%, 6.5%, and 6.1%, respectively, reaching 83.64%,
    83.27%, 83.82%, and 83.56%, respectively. This showed that the attention mechanism
    and the multi-scale feature fusion significantly improved the crop-type segmentation
    performance. Figure 6. Examples and comparison of crop-type segmentation results.
    Table 2. Performance comparison of crop-type segmentation networks. The best results
    are in bold. After introducing the self-attention-based transformer into the crop-type
    segmentation, Table 2 shows the results of SETR and SegFormer. The encoder of
    SETR, a transformer-based network, completely relied on a self-attention mechanism.
    SETR improved the accuracy by 6%, as compared to U-Net, but was slightly lower
    than DANet, DeepLabV3+, and the other CNN-based models. SegFormer outperformed
    all CNN-based models and SETR in terms of crop-type segmentation accuracy. It
    used a transformer exclusively in the feature-extraction stage and fused features
    from different scales in the decoding stage, and the accuracy achieved was 84.47%
    for mIoU and 91.92% for PA. Combining both advantages of a CNN and a transformer,
    the proposed CTFuseNet achieved the highest segmentation of 85.33% for mIoU and
    92.46% for PA. Moreover, as shown in Figure 6, the CNN-based networks resulted
    in biases, especially at the edge of large ranges of crops in complex scenes (column
    2 in Figure 6) while the transformer-based networks were not accurate for the
    segmentation of small ranges of crops (column 6 in Figure 6), and erroneous segmentation
    occurred in areas where crops were sparsely grown (column 7 in Figure 6). The
    proposed CTFuseNet obtained the best segmentation results. 4.2. Performance of
    Feature-Fusion Module In addition to the crop-type segmentation performance of
    the proposed CTFuseNet, we analyzed the impact of our proposed feature-fusion
    module (CTFuse module). In particular, the dimensions of the features extracted
    by the CNN and the transformer were different, so we used Conv2d to adjust their
    dimensions before adding the features. The segmentation accuracy is listed in
    Table 3. As compared to the mIoU of 84.47% and the PA of 91.92% for the SegFormer-B3
    without the feature fusion, simply adding the respective features of a CNN and
    a transformer achieved an mIoU of 84.98% and a PA of 92.25%. It showed that the
    CNN features, indeed, improved the segmentation accuracy. By comparing the feature-fusion
    strategies, we found that simply adding them did not make full use of the CNN
    features. By using the proposed CTFuse Module, we obtained an mIoU of 85.33%,
    which was 1.02% higher than the original SegFormer-B3 and 0.41% higher than the
    adding strategy. Table 3. Performance analysis of the feature fusion strategies.
    The best results are in bold. In addition, from the perspective of the model inference
    speed in terms of Img/s, i.e., the speed of the inference pictures per second,
    the CTFuse module was a lightweight module and had only a slight impact on the
    inference speed. 4.3. Performance of Decoders In the semantic segmentation network
    based on the encoder–decoder structure, the role of decoder was to decode the
    features extracted in the encoder and restore them to the original spatial resolution
    of the image in order to output the prediction map. Decoders were one of the key
    factors affecting the segmentation accuracy. The original SegFormer designed a
    lightweight All-MLP decoder (MLPHead), which considered the characteristics of
    its hierarchical transformer encoder. However, in our proposed dual-branch CTFuseNet,
    both a transformer and a CNN were used to extract features. Thus, the FPNHead
    from the feature pyramid network served as the decoder for the fusion features
    in this work, and the results are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Performance analysis
    of the decoders. The best results are in bold. After fusing the CNN features,
    the mIoU increased from 84.47% to 85.2%, as compared to the original SegFormer
    with MLPHead for feature decoding, and the PA improved from 91.92% to 92.41%.
    The mIoU and PA continued to increase to 85.33% and 92.46%, respectively, with
    the FPNHead for multi-scale features. Due to the pyramid decoding structure, FPNHead
    considered both global and local features and was suitable for decoding the fused
    features from the CNN and the transformer. In addition, from the perspective of
    efficiency, the inference speed of the network with FPNHead was similar to that
    with MLPHead. 5. Discussion 5.1. Classification vs. Segmentation for Crop Mapping
    Currently, the mainstream crop-mapping methods for remote sensing images include
    image classification and semantic segmentation. Since image classification can
    only predict the category information of the input image, a common practice for
    crop mapping based on image classification has been cropping the image into patches
    using a fixed-size sliding window, inputting them into an image classification
    network, and then mapping the category information based on the location of the
    patches in the whole image [50], as shown in Figure 7. In addition, since only
    a few pixels are contained in a single patch, many studies have attempted to improve
    the classification accuracy using adding additional spectral and temporal information
    from hyperspectral images [51], multispectral images [52], synthetic aperture
    radar (SAR) images [53,54], time series data [34,50], etc. Figure 7. An illustration
    of the image classification-based method for crop mapping. Conversely, semantic
    segmentation was able to process the entire image and output the classification
    information of each pixel in the entire image directly, which was more efficient
    for crop mapping. Semantic segmentation networks usually use the encoder–decoder
    structure, where the encoder is used to extract features and reduce the spatial
    dimension, and the decoder is used to parse features and recover the spatial dimension.
    Since the input of the segmentation network was the entire image containing all
    pixels, it enabled the semantic segmentation network to handle information over
    long distances and achieve high accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, in this paper,
    we exploited the semantic-segmentation-based method for accurate and efficient
    crop mapping on large-scale RGB UAV images. In addition to enhancing the feature
    extraction and fusion by the proposed dual-branch CTFuseNet and CTFuse module,
    specifically for the importance of the decoder in the semantic segmentation networks,
    we adapted the decoder to the fused features. Our proposed method showed an accuracy
    of 85.33% in mIoU and 92.46% in PA, outperforming the state-of-the-art networks
    in comparison. 5.2. Local–Global Fusion Features of CTFuseNet The results in Section
    4 demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed CTFuseNet by taking advantage
    of the extraction ability of the CNN in local features and that of the transformer
    in global features. Furthermore, we visualized heat maps by using gradient-weighted
    class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) [55] to better illustrate the features from
    the CNN and the transformer branches, as well as the fused results. Grad-CAM was
    able to generate heat maps for the gradients of the target classes flowing into
    the final convolutional layer and to highlight focal regions, and it was also
    applicable for the transformer-based networks [56]. In particular, the results
    of the single-branch CNN-based DeepLabV3+ (with ResNet50 as backbone), the single-branch
    transformer-based SegFormer (with SegFormer-B3 as backbone), and the proposed
    CTFuseNet (ResNet50 + SegFormer-B3) for different crops were evaluated. For DeepLabV3+,
    we used the final bottleneck in its backbone as the target layer to compute Grad-CAM.
    For SegFormer, the LayerNorm layer in its last transformer encoder was used. For
    the proposed CTFuseNet, the final convolutional layer in the CTFuse module was
    used. By overlaying the heat map onto the remote sensing image, we observed the
    regions the model prioritized, as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. Figure 8. An
    example of heat map of corn and building. The rows from top to bottom are results
    from DeepLabV3+, SegFormer and the proposed CTFuseNet, respectively. Figure 9.
    An example of heat map of corn and barley. The rows from top to bottom are results
    from DeepLabV3+, SegFormer and the proposed CTFuseNet, respectively. The top and
    the second rows in Figure 8 show that the CNN-based DeepLabV3+ prioritized local,
    small-scale feature information, and the transformer-based SegFormer was more
    suited for extracting feature over long distances at large scales. However, for
    the crop-type segmentation task, the remote sensing images not only captured information
    about the crops but also about the underlying soil, so the local information,
    such as texture and color, were also important. Therefore, from the segmentation
    results, the transformer-based SegFormer was not accurate in segmenting the corn.
    In contrast, for our proposed dual-branch CTFuseNet, the local information obtained
    from the CNN branch compensated for the transformer branch, thus achieving better
    segmentation results. Another example of a heat map for core and barley is presented
    in Figure 9. In the modeling of the barley features in the lower left corner of
    Figure 9, DeepLabV3+ identified only a small fraction of objects while SegFormer
    could not identify any. Due to the proposed CTFuseNet’s ability to model both
    local features and long-range global features, it surpassed the single-branch
    DeepLabV3+ and SegFormer’s ability to identify barley. With the addition of the
    results mentioned in Section 4, our model segmented the barley type with an accuracy
    of 80.84% in IoU, outperforming DeepLabV3+’s 78.13% and SegFormer-B3’s 78.98%.
    Similarly, it segmented the corn type with an IoU of 78.61%, as compared to DeepLabV3+’s
    76.39% and SegFormer-B3’s 77.08%, which improved by 2.9% and 2.0%, respectively.The
    above heat maps illustrate the features that contributed to the crop-type segmentation
    improvement of the proposed fusion network. 5.3. Fusion Strategies of CNN and
    Transformer Given the huge advantages transformers have over CNN for global feature
    extraction and the modeling of long-range semantic information, many researchers
    have started to integrate the merits of transformers in the field of vision, such
    as through ViT [27] for image classification, DETR [57] for object detection,
    SETR [21], and SegFormer [28] for semantic segmentation, and they have achieved
    the state-of-the-art performance. However, transformer-based networks often require
    cutting images into small patches, which causes loss of spatial information, while
    CNN-based networks are excellent for extractin local information. Therefore, a
    series of networks to combine CNNs and transformers have emerged, such as TransUNet
    [58], CoAtNet [59], CvT [60], Conformer [61], CMT [33], etc. These networks usually
    combine CNN and Transformer in two ways. One uses a single-branch junction structure,
    where the features extracted by the CNN are then fed into the Transformer, or
    the features extracted by the Transformer are then fed into the CNN, with the
    goal of extracting both local features and global features in a single processing
    flow. The other is to use a dual-branch structure to extract the features using
    a CNN and a Transformer in different branches and then to fuse the results, which
    is exemplified in the feature-coupling unit (FCU) in Conformer [61]. We adopted
    the latter approach in this paper, i.e., we proposed a two-branch network that
    used a CNN and a transformer for feature extraction in two branches and then fused
    the features using the CTFuse module. This approach provided the ability to use
    existing advanced networks and their pre-trained weights to achieve satisfactory
    results with only minor fine-tuning, which mitigated having to train the model
    from the very beginning. This was beneficial to the field of remote sensing since
    labeled data is generally limited. In addition, the feature-extraction backbone
    networks on both branches could be readily replaced with lightweight networks,
    enabling easy switching during tasks that require high computational speeds. 5.4.
    Statistical Significance Analysis In this study, we employed the McNemar test
    [62] to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in accuracy between
    our proposed CTFuseNet method and the methods adopted for comparison [63,64].
    The McNemar test compared the classification results of two methods on the same
    set of samples and recorded the classification results for each method in a 2×2
    contingency table, as shown in Table 5. Where 𝑓 11 is the proportion of samples
    classified correctly by both classification methods, 𝑓 12 is the proportion classified
    correctly by classification method 1 while incorrectly by method 2, and 𝑓 21 is
    the proportion classified incorrectly by method 1 while correctly by method 2,
    and 𝑓 22 is the proportion that classified incorrectly by both methods. Table
    5. Contingency table for McNemar test between two classification results. For
    the comparison of different algorithms, the McNemar test statistic was then calculated
    by Formula (8). As it follows a Chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom,
    the p-value was obtained from the chi-squared distribution in table [65] or estimated
    by statistical software [66]. To evaluate the statistical significance of the
    test, the p-value was compared to a predetermined significance level 𝛼 , which
    was typically set at 0.05. If the p-value was lower than 𝛼 , the null hypothesis
    that the two classification methods had equivalent performance was rejected. However,
    if the p-value was greater than 𝛼 , there was not enough evidence to reject the
    null hypothesis. 𝜒 2 = ( 𝑓 12 − 𝑓 21 ) 2 𝑓 12 + 𝑓 21 (8) We adopted the starting
    point U-Net and the transformer-based SegFormer with the closest performance as
    baselines and employed the McNemar test on the test set to evaluate the statistical
    significance of the proposed CTFuseNet against the baselines. As our model was
    a multi-class semantic segmentation model, we assessed its performance by transforming
    a pixel-by-pixel classification task, which resulted in a total of 512×512×2608
    samples. The comparison between CTFuseNet and U-Net yielded a McNemar test statistic
    of 11.9949 and a p-value of 0.00053, where the p-value was much lower than the
    significance level 0.05, indicating a statistically significant improvement in
    performance by CTFuseNet, as compared to U-Net. Similarly, the comparison between
    CTFuseNet and SegFormer resulted in a McNemar test statistic of 22.7454 and a
    p-value of 1.85× 10 −6 , further highlighting the superior performance of CTFuseNet
    over SegFormer. The statistical analysis demonstrated that the proposed CTFuseNet
    outperformed the benchmarks with statistical significance, providing evidence
    for the effectiveness of our approach in crop-type segmentation. 5.5. Model Transferability
    Changing environmental and image scene in the diverse geographic, temporal, and
    sensor conditions may cause data distribution shifts [67,68]. Therefore, the deep
    learning models trained on a certain set of labeled images are generally restricted
    to a specific dataset [69] and may not yield satisfactory performance for unseen
    data when applied to different image acquisition conditions [70]. The model transferability
    across domains, e.g., geo-locations, time, and sensors, have been a significant
    challenge and major concern in the remote sensing community [71]. The proposed
    CTFusedNet in this paper integrated a parallel structure of CNN and transformer
    branches (i.e., ResNet and SegFormer, respectively) that maintained their independence.
    Current research has shown the generalization capability of ResNet [72,73] and
    Vision transformer [73] by mathematical analysis and experimental results. In
    addition, data augmentation is also an effective way to diversify the training
    dataset and improve the generalization of the DL-based method [69], and therefore,
    we performed data augmentation, e.g., random cropping, scaling, flipping, and
    photometric distortions. However, the benchmark dataset had a limited spatio-temporal
    configuration, so the model generalization ability was evaluated by the testing
    dataset. For data from different geo-locations, time, or sensors, transfer learning
    is a general practice considered to foster model generalization and improve performance
    [70,74]. Moreover, efforts have been divide into the following aspects, i.e.,
    weakly supervised learning, optimal model and feature selection, semi-supervised
    domain adaptation, deep metric based methods for few-shot learning, and meta-learning
    with deep metric embedding [67]. The comprehensive assessment and promotion of
    model transferability across domains is a critical direction in our future work.
    6. Conclusions In this paper, considering that the existing CNN-based crop segmentation
    methods lack long-range contextual information, which limits its accuracy, we
    introduced a self-attention based transformer and provided a flexible, parallel
    method for coupling CNN and transformer architectures to obtain long-term feature
    dependencies as supplementary while preserving local details for accurate crop-type
    segmentation on UAV remote sensing imagery. Therefore, we proposed an end-to-end
    CNN–transformer feature-fused network (CTFuseNet) to fully aggregate and decode
    the multi-scale global and local features based on the transformer and CNN architectures.
    The CTFuseNet provided a parallel global–local feature extraction structure based
    on the transformer and CNN architectures in the encoder for accurate crop-type
    segmentation. A new feature–fusion module, CTFuse, was designed to flexibly fuse
    the extracted multi-scale features from the CNN and the transformer. In addition,
    FPNHead from the feature pyramid network served as the decoder to adapt to the
    fused multi-scale features and further improve the accuracy. The experimental
    results showed that for crop-type segmentation, according to the benchmark dataset,
    we achieved the highest accuracy with an mIoU of 85.33% and a PA of 92.46%, which
    was an increase of 2.4% and 1.0%, respectively, as compared to the single-branch
    networks, i.e., the CNN-based ResNet50 and the transformer-based SegFormer-B3.
    It also outperformed the typical networks, including U-Net, PSPNet, DeepLabV3+,
    DANet, OCRNet, SETR, and SegFormer. It should be noted that, due to the high flexibility
    of the CTFuse module we developed, the proposed CTFuseNet provided a framework
    for combining more advanced transformer or CNN branches and to further enhance
    the crop-type segmentation capabilities. Despite the performance improvements
    achieved by the proposed CTFuseNet, there are still challenges, especially for
    real-time crop-type segmentation tasks onboard UAVs. In the future, in addition
    to designing feature-fusion modules and decoders with better performance, we will
    prioritize lightweight crop-type segmentation networks through model compression
    technologies, such as model pruning and knowledge distillation, to reduce the
    model size and computation complexity, as well as to promote the inference efficiency.
    Furthermore, we will thoroughly assess and improve the model robustness and transferability
    on diverse datasets. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.X. and J.L.; literature

    prediction was evaluated. • Three machine learning algorithms were tested to choose
    the best method for SMC estimation. • Mild to modest deficit irrigation treatments
    are more conducive to soil moisture monitoring. • RFR provide promising results
    across growing seasons, stages, and water status. Abstract Timely and accurate
    estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is essential for precise irrigation
    management at the farm scale. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing with

    stagesDeficit irrigation 1. Introduction Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an
    important role in agricultural, meteorological, climatological, and hydrological
    applications. A proper decision for precision irrigation is facilitated by accurate
    information about the SMC at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale. It is
    difficult to obtain spatially continuous observations using conventional in-situ
    methods of SMC measurement, such as the drying method (O’Kelly and Sivakumar,
    2014), time domain reflectometry (Robinson et al., 2003), neutron probe measurements
    (Evett and Steiner, 1995), and heat pulse measurements (Agliata et al., 2019),
    owing to discrete sampling points and high cost (Guo et al., 2022). With significant
    advances in remote sensing technology, satellite data have been widely applied
    to SMC estimation, particularly the optical (Serrano et al., 2019), thermal (Sohrabinia
    et al., 2014), and microwave (Chen et al., 2018) observations. Nevertheless, the
    application of satellite data for SMC estimation is limited by the low resolution
    and near-surface depth of the measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology
    provides high spatio-temporal resolution data for estimating SMC (Hill et al.,
    2017). Several studies have successfully used UAV-based optical remote sensing
    for SMC estimation, mainly in the near-infrared and visible bands, to establish
    vegetation indices (VIs) (Kogan, 1990, Ge et al., 2021). Moreover, UAV-based thermal
    remote sensing has been shown to accurately predict farmland moisture (Li et al.,
    2022). Recent studies have shown that integrating multi-source remote sensing
    data can be effectively used for SMC estimation. For example, Wigmore et al. (2019)
    used multispectral (MS) and thermal (TIR) data from UAV remote sensing to calculate
    the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), which was applied to predict
    surface SMC within mountain environments and obtained results with R2 = 0.55–0.76.
    Cheng et al. (2022) combined UAV-based multimodal data to estimate the SMC under
    high maize canopy coverage and obtained results with R2 = 0.78. Guo et al. (2022)
    combined microwave remote sensing and UAV multispectral remote sensing to monitor
    SMC in a winter wheat planting area and obtained results with R2 = 0.92. Nevertheless,
    microwaves cannot penetrate dense fields with tall plants such as maize. Therefore,
    UAV-based optical and thermal sensing has been widely used in current research
    on SMC estimations (Cheng et al., 2022). Because of the correlation between vegetation
    spectrum and SMC under agricultural crops, various parametric and non-parametric
    regression models have been implemented to monitor SMC (e.g., machine learning
    algorithms (MLA)) (Chen et al., 2021, Döpper et al., 2022). To improve the performance
    of SMC estimation in saline soils, partial least squares regression (PLSR) with
    thermal infrared data was used to build the SMC prediction model (Xu and Wang,
    2015). Ge et al. (2019) applied the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm to
    predict the SMC in winter wheat using UAV-based hyperspectral imagery. Consequently,
    choosing a proper regression algorithm is essential for achieving accurate SMC
    predictions for dense vegetation. Generally, most approaches to estimating SMC
    using a combination of UAV remote sensing and MLA have been applied at a specific
    growth stage or a single growth day (Cheng et al., 2022, Guo et al., 2022). However,
    the dynamics of VIs and SMC continuously change over time. Additionally, one SMC
    value may correspond to multiple VIs and thus may affect the performance of the
    SMC estimation. However, only a limited number of studies have been conducted
    to monitor SMC using UAV remote sensing and MLA during the entire crop-growing
    season. Furthermore, SMC estimation models were only tested and trained for one
    year, and several samples (Seo et al., 2021). Crops are susceptible to changes
    in SMC and spectral reflectance of maize canopy varies with growth stage and soil
    water content. Although UAV remote sensing has been applied to SMC prediction
    at arid and semi-arid sites (Babaeian et al., 2021), the irrigation regimes are
    the same; therefore, verification of SMC is limited. Few studies have focused
    on different water treatments for crops. Thus, the performance of SMC estimation
    using VIs and MLA at different growth stages of crops under different water treatments
    is still unclear. Based on the above analysis, this study used the SMC under the
    maize planting area as the research object and acquired RGB, MS, and TIR data
    at different growth stages of maize under different irrigation treatments for
    cross-year SMC estimation. The specific objectives were to 1) compare the potential
    of UAV multiple types of sensors in the SMC prediction model by MLA during the
    whole growing season, and determine an optimal model, 2) evaluate the robustness
    of SMC estimation using the optimal model for different irrigation treatments,
    and3) examine the performance of SMC estimation using the optimal model at different
    growth stages. 2. Material 2.1. Field site description The field site was located
    in Ordos, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The climate is semi-arid, with
    an elevation of 1010 m. Maize (cv. ‘Junkai 918’) was planted in May, tasseled
    in July, and harvested for silage in September 2018 and 2019. The soil type was
    loamy sand (80.7 % sand, 13.7 % powder, and 5.6 % clay) with a field capacity
    of 20.3 % and a soil bulk density of 1.56 g cm−3. The row and planting spacing
    were 0.58 m and 0.25 m in 2018, and 0.40 m and 0.25 m in 2019. The entire field
    was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Nebraska, USA) and divided into five regions with different irrigation treatments
    throughout the growing seasons (May to September) of 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 1a).
    Each irrigation treatment included three replicated individual plots (6 m × 6
    m) (Fig. 1b). Deficit irrigation was applied independently during the vegetative
    (V), reproductive (R) and maturation (M) stages. The treatment was named based
    on the target percentage of evapotranspiration of non-stressed crops during each
    growth stage. For example, a treatment (40/100/80) indicated the treatment received
    irrigation of 40 %, 100 %, and 80 % of maximum evapotranspiration during the V,
    R, and M growth stages, respectively. Here we use TR1-TR5 to represent treatments
    at five different irrigation levels (from maximum to minimum irrigation amounts),
    respectively (Table 1). The amount of irrigation and precipitation (Table 1) were
    measured using a flowmeter and rain gauge cylinders with three replications. Download

    Field measurements A soil auger was used to collect soil samples which were then
    used to measure gravimetric SMC (SMCg) at depths of 10 and 20 cm. To ensure accurate
    measurements, each plot was divided into 30 equal subplots. Each time, three subplots
    were randomly selected among the 30 subplots to measure SMC data to avoid repetition,
    as shown in Fig. 2. The average of the three measurements was the in-situ measured
    SMC for a given plot. SMC measurements were performed after the UAV flight campaign
    in the field. A total of 300 in-situ measured SMC for a given plot were collected
    from 2018 to 2019. The volumetric soil moisture content (SMC, cm3cm−3) was calculated
    as follows: (1) SMC = S M C g × ρ Where ρ represents soil bulk density (g cm−3).
    Undisturbed soil samples at 0–20 cm were collected using a cutting ring (diameter,
    5 cm; height, 5 cm). The samples were then dried to a constant weight in an oven
    at 105 ℃. The measured weight was converted into standard units (g cm−3). For
    example, the measured soil moisture at two soil depths along with the rainfall/irrigation
    in 2018 TR1 were shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download

    unmanned aircraft DJI S900 (DJI, Shenzhen, China) platform was developed to carry
    UAV high-resolution RGB (DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, China), MS RedEdge (MicaSense
    Inc., USA), and TIR (FLIR Systems, USA) sensors (Fig. 4). The details of each
    camera are listed in Table 2. The UAV was used to capture images between 11:00
    and 14:00 under low wind speeds and clear sky conditions during the entire maize
    growing season in 2018 (10 d) and 2019 (10 d) (Table 3). The flight heights were
    set at 70 m and the flight path resulted in 85 % front and side overlap. The spatial
    resolutions of RGB, MS and TIR images were 3, 5, and 9 cm, respectively. During
    the UAV flights, a MicaSense (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) calibrated reflectance
    panel and the temperatures of ground objects (e.g., black and white cotton fabric
    pieces, wet/dry soil, crop canopy, water, etc.) collected simultaneously were
    used for radiometric correction of the MS and TIR imagery, respectively. Six ground
    control points (GCPs) were placed for georeferencing imagery from UAV multi-sensors.

    images were later converted to reflectance values. During post-processing, the
    parameters of the thermal images were adjusted according to the environmental
    conditions, such as air temperature and humidity, to conduct radiometric conversion.

    from the UAV thermal imagery, which were converted using a linear model (Fig.

    features Fractional vegetation cover (FVC), the proportion of green vegetation
    on the ground surface, was extracted from the RGB imagery using the Otsu (maximum
    between-class variance) method (Otsu, 1979, Zhang et al., 2019). The classified
    maize pixels were divided by the total pixels for a given plot, and the formula
    for the FVC calculation is presented as follows: (2) FVC = N maize N total In
    addition, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) (Haralick et al., 1973) was
    employed to extract texture features from the RGB in this study and then used
    as input data for SMC prediction. The GLCM-based texture information, that is,
    variance (VA), contrast (CO), entropy (EN), correlation (COR), mean (ME), homogeneity
    (HO), dissimilarity (DS), and second moment (SM), was computed using the ENVI
    5.3 software (Table 4). 3.2.2. Multispectral features A set of UAV-based VIs,
    previously used to estimate the SMC, was extracted from the raw spectral bands
    and is listed in Table 4. Additionally, GLCM was extracted from the NIR and red
    edge bands using the same methods as described above. 3.2.3. Thermal features
    Normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT) was derived from UAV thermal infrared
    imagery. The NRCT was used to assess crop water status (Maimaitijiang et al.,
    2020). The detailed formula for NRCT is as follows: (3) NRCT = ( T i - T min )
    ( T max - T min ) where Ti represents the UAV-based temperature of the i-th pixel
    and Tmin (Tmax) represents the lowest (highest) UAV-based temperature in the entire
    field. Moreover, we applied the TVDI to predict SMC, which is based on the simplified
    surface temperature-vegetation index (Ts-NDVI) space method (Fig. 5) and has been
    commonly implemented to characterize water status and SMC (Sandholt et al., 2002,
    Liu et al., 2008). TVDI is calculated as follows: (4) TVDI = ( T s - T s min )
    ( T s max - T s min ) T s max = a dry + b dry × N D V I (6) T s min = a wet +
    b wet × N D V I where Tsmax (Tsmin) is the highest (lowest) Ts observation and
    adry, awet bdry, and bwet are the intercept and slope of the dry (wet) edge (Fig.
    6), respectively. Download : Download high-res image (48KB) Download : Download

    Modeling methods All the input features in Table 4 were extracted for the 15 sampling
    plots (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) and then matched to the in situ measured SMC of each plot.
    A total of 300 in-situ measured SMC for a given plot were collected during the
    UAV flights from 2018 to 2019 and used for training and testing the performance
    of the model developed in this study. SMC estimation models were developed using
    MLA: PLSR (Rischbeck et al., 2016), K nearest neighbor (KNN) (Shahabul Alam and
    Elshorbagy, 2015), and RFR (Cheng et al., 2022). The RFR algorithm for SMC estimation
    was compared with the PLSR and KNN algorithms to select an optimal SMC prediction
    method. The MLA was implemented using Python with the Scikit-learn library. For
    a fair and uniform comparison of machine learning methods, 80 % of randomly selected
    input features and SMC data (240 SMC measurements) were used as training samples,
    and the remaining 20 % (60 SMC measurements) were used as unseen samples to test
    the performance of the prediction algorithms. 3.3.2. Validation methods The accuracy
    of the SMC estimation algorithms was verified by fivefold cross-validation; therefore,
    240 SMC measurements were used independently for model validation. Then, the average
    accuracy was obtained. The model performance was evaluated using the coefficient
    of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative root-mean-square
    error (rRMSE). The detailed workflow, from feature extraction to model building
    and validation, is shown in Fig. 7. First, different features were extracted from
    three types of imagery, such as FVC, GLCM, and vegetation indices. Then, three
    machine learning methods with the above features as inputs were used to establish
    SMC prediction models and the measured SMC data were used for model training and
    testing. Finally, the applicability of the SMC prediction models under different
    growth stages (V, R, and M) and irrigation levels (TR1–TR5) was analyzed. Download

    Workflow of multimodal data extraction and modeling. 4. Results 4.1. Estimation
    accuracy of soil moisture content As shown in Table 5, generally, RFR exhibited
    the highest estimation accuracy compared to PLSR and KNN, with R2 ranging from
    0.42 to 0.61 for 10-cm soil depth, and 0.41 to 0.65 for 20-cm soil depth, respectively.
    The best SMC prediction was observed in the case of using the combination of RGB,
    MS, and TIR data, with R2 = 0.61 and 0.65, RMSE = 1.9 % and 2.1 %, as well as
    rRMSE = 23.4 % and 26.3 % for 10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively. When using
    data from a single sensor, the multispectral sensor produced better accuracy in
    SMC prediction than the thermal and RGB sensors did. Table 5. Validation of different

    The best result in terms of R2, RMSE and RMSE% values through different sensors
    with various modeling methods are boldfaced. Generally, all MLA produced a gradually
    increasing R2 and a decreasing rRMSE with an increasing number of sensors (Table
    5). This is because all the methods can effectively fuse information from multimodal
    data. The accuracy of the SMC estimation model based on MS sensors, a combination
    of MS and RGB sensors, or a combination of RGB and TIR sensors was similar at
    both soil depths (R2 = 0.3–0.57, rRMSE = 25.3–34.8 %). The joint use of TIR and
    MS data showed a higher estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.41–0.64), making it more suitable
    for SMC prediction (Table 5). However, the combination of RGB and TIR data had
    a relatively higher accuracy, regardless of the MLA (Table 5). The inclusion of
    RGB data in the combination of MS and TIR data slightly increased the estimation
    accuracy, With PLSR, R2 increased only by 0.02 for 10-cm soil depth while using
    KNN, R2 increased by 0.08 for 20-cm soil depth. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 show the observed
    and estimated SMC using the RFR for various combinations of UAV data for both
    10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively. The estimation result of the 20-cm soil
    depth was slightly better than that of the 10-cm soil depth regardless of the
    combination of sensors, indicating that the estimation accuracy of SMC was similar
    at the two depths during the entire growth period. Download : Download high-res

    sensor. 4.2. Soil water content prediction for different growth stages Fig. 10
    shows the performance of the RFR model at V, R, and M stages. The SMC at the V
    stage was the most accurate estimation in both 2018 and 2019, regardless of the
    soil depth. For the 10-cm depth SMC estimation model, R2 and rRMSE were 0.68 and
    20.82 %; for the 20-cm depth SMC estimation model, R2 and rRMSE were 0.78 and
    19.36 %, respectively. At the R stage, the RFR model exhibited the poorest performance,
    with an R2 of 0.37. Moreover, the SMC estimation accuracies at each stage for
    the two depths were similar and comparable. Among them, the estimation model overestimated
    under low SMC and underestimated under high SMC in both years. Therefore, the
    differences in irrigation amount and meteorological conditions, especially precipitation,
    may decrease the accuracy of SMC estimation using the RFR model and UAV-based
    multimodal data. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download

    stage), R (reproductive stage), and M (maturation stage). 4.3. Soil water content
    prediction for different water treatments Fig. 11, Fig. 12 show the performance
    of the RFR model across different irrigation treatments. In this study, we divided
    the irrigation treatments into five levels (TR1-TR5 from high to low). The optimal
    estimation using the RFR algorithm was achieved for TR1 with R2 and rRMSE of 0.65
    and 21.33 % at 10-cm soil depth, and R2 and rRMSE of 0.76 and 18.61 % at 20-cm
    soil depth, respectively. This indicates that the RFR model based on UAV-based
    multimodal data can provide a comparable estimation of SMC for different soil
    depths throughout the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. Furthermore, the accuracy
    of the SMC prediction model under the severe-stressed irrigation treatment (TR5)
    was relatively low (R2 = 0.35–0.41, rRMSE = 21.22 %–33.26 %) compared to TR2–TR4
    irrigation levels. It can be inferred that the RFR model utilizing multimodal
    information is more applicable to mild water stress treatments. Generally, the
    rRMSE for the 20-cm depth SMC estimation had an average value of 25.40 %, which
    was slightly greater than the corresponding value of 24.38 % for the 10-cm depth
    SMC estimation. At a depth of 10 cm, the SMC estimation had an R2 = 0.41–0.65
    with an average value of 0.53, and at 20 cm depth, R2 = 0.35–0.76 with a mean
    value of 0.56. Therefore, the SMC estimation exhibited similar performance at
    both depths. Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download : Download full-size

    13, Fig. 14 show the SMC distribution (spatial resolution: 1 m) using RFR with

    irrigation treatments when irrigation regimes were different, especially for the
    10-cm depth SMC maps on 23 Aug 2018 (the average of TR1 = 11.39 % and TR5 = 9.33
    %) and 20-cm depth SMC map on 26 Jul 2019 (the average of TR1 = 12.21 %, TR2 =
    10.35 %, and TR5 = 9.24 %). Meanwhile, the SMC values for the different treatments
    were similar when irrigation regimes were the same, for example, the 10-cm depth
    SMC on 26 Jul 2018 (the average of TR1–TR5 = 10.35 %–10.77 %). Generally, the
    RFR model with the fusion of RGB, TIR, and MS data can be used to characterize
    the spatial distribution of the SMC, which provides a reference for precision
    irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (521KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several studies have already shown that UAV remote sensing can be effectively
    employed to predict SMC at a farmland scale (Table 6), but most experiments had
    only focused on a single day or specific growth stage in the growing season (Cheng
    et al., 2022, Ge et al., 2021). In this study, UAV-based multimodal data were
    used to build an SMC prediction model throughout the growing season. The fusion
    of multimodal data (RGB, MS, and TIR) produced the best accuracy regardless of
    the modeling method, with significant accuracy of approximately 2 % RMSE. These
    results agree with those of previous studies, such as Cheng et al. (2022), who
    also found that texture, temperature, and spectral information offered unique
    and complementary information conducive to SMC prediction. The joint use of TIR
    and MS data showed a higher estimation accuracy, making it more suitable for SMC
    prediction (Table 5). This may be because the thermal-based temperature data can
    solve asymptotic saturation problems of MS data at maturity stages (Rischbeck
    et al., 2016). However, the inclusion of RGB data in the MS data slightly improved
    the estimation accuracy of the PLSR, KNN and RFR algorithms. These results indicate
    that the MS and RGB data exhibit information overlap and homogeneity (Pelizari
    et al., 2018). Because of its indirect linkage with soil moisture under vegetation
    conditions, optical and thermal observations are suitable for fitting nonlinear
    models to retrieve soil moisture, particularly MLA (Ge et al., 2019, Guan et al.,
    2022). Consequently, we tested three MLA to estimate the SMC throughout the growing
    season for two years. The results showed that the RFR model is more robust for
    multiple sensors at both 10- and 20-cm depths, compared to the other MLA (Table
    5 and Fig. 8, Fig. 9). Consistent with previous research, the RFR method can overcome
    redundant information and overfitting (Chen et al., 2019, Hu et al., 2018). Table

    2022 Owing to vegetation interference, especially in conditions of dense vegetation
    coverage, optical and thermal infrared remote sensing may not be able to obtain
    soil status. However, the severe water stress at any crop growth stage of maize
    directly affects crop physiology, growth, and developmental processes (e.g., leaf
    curl and senescence, increased canopy temperature, and decreased chlorophyll content),
    resulting in phenotype, spectral and temperature variations of the canopy (Kullberg
    et al., 2017). The above changes provide a theoretical basis for indirect monitoring
    of soil moisture distribution. In this case, the SMC has generally been estimated
    based on status of vegetation (Zhang and Zhou, 2016, Cheng et al., 2022). Thus,
    this approach bypasses the uncertainty in describing the physical process, which
    makes this method simple and feasible. The RFR-based multimodal model performed
    robustly in the cross-year soil moisture estimation at the V stage for both depths
    (Fig. 10). This is because the growth characteristics (such as canopy structure,
    greenness, and plant water status) that are highly correlated with VIs are sensitive
    to soil moisture at the V stage (Ma et al., 2018). Conversely, the RFR-based multimodal
    method produced a relatively low accuracy in the cross-year SMC estimation at
    the other stages (Fig. 10). This is because high vegetation coverage may lead
    to saturation of the optical sensors (Wallace, 2013), resulting in an overall
    bias in the estimation. Previous studies have shown that UAV thermal imagery can
    be used to detect crop water stress (Zhang et al., 2019) that responds to insufficient
    soil moisture in the root zone (Sampathkumar et al., 2012). However, optical and
    thermal-based indices may be conservative indicators under high vegetation coverage
    and not able to detect the droughts caused by water stress or rainfall anomalies
    immediately. Consequently, the top layer of the soil profile had the greatest
    error in estimating soil moisture at the R stage. The accuracy at the M stage
    was lower than that reported by Cheng et al. (2022) with R2 = 0.78. This difference
    is related to climate, water stress, irrigation method, cultivar, and planting
    density. Further research regarding the impact of climatic and field management
    conditions on SMC predictions should be conducted for different crop species.
    Deficit irrigation has been proposed as a strategy for maintaining yield while
    reducing agricultural water use (Al-Ghobari and Dewidar, 2018). The results showed
    that the RFR-based multimodal method performed robustly throughout the growing
    season under well-watered and mild to moderate-stressed irrigation treatments,
    indicating that the model built using UAV multimodal data is feasible and effective
    for estimating SMC (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). However, under the full-irrigation treatment,
    there was an underestimation under wet conditions (high SMC) for both years. This
    is because the meteorological conditions and the increase in canopy coverage may
    decrease the SMC estimation accuracy when using multimodal data (Cheng et al.,
    2022). Furthermore, under the severe-stressed irrigation treatment, the SMC was
    overestimated in the low-SMC region for both years. This is because of the VI-saturation
    issue and underestimation of the water stress status (Vergara-Díaz et al., 2016,
    Virnodkar et al., 2020). Additionally, the estimation accuracy of SMC by the RFR-based
    multimodal model at the 20-cm depth was similar to that at the 10-cm depth under
    different irrigation treatments, indicating that the estimation method is effective
    in utilizing multimodal information for both soil depths. The results showed that
    the RFR-based multimodal method outperformed the other regression methods under
    different irrigation treatments across the years. The model using RFR with combined
    RGB, TIR, and MS data can be used for SMC estimation under well-watered and mild
    to moderate deficit irrigation treatments; therefore, this SMC map can be applied
    to design optimal regulated deficit irrigation strategies because maize productivity
    is improved by moderate deficit irrigation (Zou et al., 2021). Meanwhile, in agricultural
    production, farmers are most concerned about soil moisture status in the days
    after irrigation/rainfall. Our study has proven the potential of the RFR-based
    multimodal method to improve irrigation scheduling by precisely evaluating the
    SMC. Further work is suggested to investigate other soil types, which may determine
    the applicability and transferability of the method. However, the high deficit
    irrigation treatment led to low accuracy of the prediction model owing to optical
    saturation issues and redundant datasets. Recently technologies have been used
    to extract related information from UAV-based images for crop yield prediction
    using deep-learning algorithms (Ma et al., 2021). For instance, Maimaitijiang
    et al. (2020) reported that UAV-based multimodal data using deep learning methods
    improved yield prediction model accuracy compared to MLA, such as RFR and PLSR.
    Therefore, further work should investigate the generality of deep learning-based
    methods for SMC estimation. The application of our technique and prediction models
    to other climatological conditions should be investigated further. 6. Conclusions
    The ability of fused multimodal data (RGB, MS, and TIR data) derived from UAV-based
    multi-sensors for SMC estimation by MLA was investigated under different levels
    of irrigation. The major conclusions are as follows: 1. MS data outperformed RGB
    and TIR data for single sensor-based SMC prediction during the entire growing
    season. The joint use of TIR and MS data showed great potential for SMC prediction
    with higher estimation accuracy. Generally, the combination of all types of sensors
    using the RFR algorithm exhibited the most accurate estimation of the SMC, regardless
    of the modeling method. 2. The RFR method generated the most accurate and robust
    SMC estimations at the vegetative stage, followed by the maturation stage. However,
    they produced less accurate SMC estimation under high vegetation coverage during
    the reproductive stage. Additionally, the RFR method exhibited strong adaptability
    to the two soil depths (10- and 20-cm) with similar prediction accuracy. 3. The
    RFR method produced the best estimation accuracy under well-watered and mild to
    modest deficit irrigated treatments. However, they produced less accurate SMC
    estimation under severe deficit irrigated treatments. CRediT authorship contribution

  limitations: The study was limited to a specific crop (maize) and climate conditions
    (semi-arid). The transferability of the models to other crops, soil types, and
    climates may need further investigation. Additionally, the study did not consider
    other factors that could influence SMC estimation, such as soil texture, organic
    matter content, and root distribution.

  verbatim_quote1: The RFR model using all three types of data generated the most
    accurate and robust SMC estimation at the vegetative stage with R2 of 0.68 and
    0.78, and rRMSE of 20.82% and 19.36% for 10- and 20-cm soil depths, respectively.

- analysis: The study aims to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using
    extracted data from satellite images. The authors explore both semi-arid and humid
    climates and use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize multilayer perceptron
    (MLP) models. Based on satellite data from 2003 to 2021, they develop three models
    using different combinations of input variables, including land surface temperature
    (LST), vegetation indices (NDVI), and a combination of both. The results show
    that the SGD-MLP-3 model, utilizing LST, vegetation indices, and their combination,
    provides the most accurate ET0 estimates. LST is identified as the most influential
    parameter for ET0 estimation in both climates. Overall, the study contributes
    to the development of improved ET0 estimation methods using remote sensing data.

  description: Agricultural water management, crop modeling, and irrigation scheduling
    are all dependent on the accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0).
    A satellite image can also compensate for the lack of reliable weather information.
    So, in this study, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been implemented for
    optimizing multilayer perceptron (MLP) and developing SGD-MLP to estimate daily
    ET0 in Tabriz (semi-arid climate) and Babolsar (humid climate) stations, Iran,
    using extracted data from satellite images. The estimated ET0 values were compared
    to the determined ET0 based on the FAO-Penman–Monteith equation. Based on satellite

    Agricultural water management, crop modeling, and irrigation scheduling are all
    dependent on the accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0). A
    satellite image can also compensate for the lack of reliable weather information.
    So, in this study, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been implemented for
    optimizing multilayer perceptron (MLP) and developing SGD-MLP to estimate daily
    ET0 in Tabriz (semi-arid climate) and Babolsar (humid climate) stations, Iran,
    using extracted data from satellite images. The estimated ET0 values were compared
    to the determined ET0 based on the FAO-Penman–Monteith equation. Based on satellite
    image data collected from 2003 to 2021, the database was constructed. During the
    development of the abovementioned models, data from 2003 to 2016 (70%) were used
    for training purposes, and residual data (30%) were used for testing purposes.
    Additionally, the input variables, including land surface temperature (LST) day
    and night, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI),
    and a fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) from MODIS sensor,
    were utilized to estimate the daily ET0. Thus, there are three studied models;
    first is based on the LST, second on the vegetation indices, and third on the
    combination of the LST and the vegetation indices. Additionally, four performance
    indexes, including the coefficient of determination (R2), the root-mean-square
    error (RMSE), Willmott’s index of agreement (WI), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency,
    were utilized in order to measure the implemented model’s accuracy. According
    to the obtained results, the SGD-MLP-3 with input parameters of LSTday&night,
    LSTmean, LAI, NDVI, and FPAR gave the most accurate results with RMSE and WI values
    of as 0.417 mm/day, 0.973, for Tabriz and 0.754 mm/day, 0.922 for Babolsar stations,
    respectively. Conclusively, LST of daytime, nighttime, and average may be suggested
    as the most influential parameter for ET0 estimation. Similar content being viewed

    the reference crop evapotranspiration in the Beas-Sutlej basin (India): an artificial
    neural network approach based on different combinations of meteorological data
    Article 03 February 2022 Introduction Water resources management, especially irrigation
    agriculture, relies heavily on reference evapotranspiration (ET0) (Valipour 2015).
    In irrigation, ET0 has the most direct and significant application. To calculate
    crop evapotranspiration in the field, ET0 is the key parameter. There have been
    several studies showing that an irrigation system that is both detailed and rational
    can increase irrigation water efficiency (Cifre et al. 2005; Du et al. 2010).
    So, understanding the relationship between climatic conditions and evapotranspiration
    is fundamental for determining an agricultural crop’s optimal water requirement
    (Maeda et al. 2011). Therefore, an effective irrigation system is based on the
    accuracy of evapotranspiration estimation. Several approaches to calculating ET0
    have been developed in recent decades using physical principles, such as mass
    transfer and energy balance (Maeda et al. 2011). However, the Penman–Monteith
    FAO-56 (FAO-PM) approach is the most commonly used method for calculating ET0
    (Djaman et al. 2015). Although FAO-PM is achievable, its implementation remains
    inconvenient due to its requirement for large amounts of meteorological data,
    which originate from standard meteorological observation stations (Hobbins 2016;
    Mokari et al. 2021). Therefore, it is necessary to collect information on temperature,
    wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and other factors for implementing
    the FAO-PM method. Thus, a model with fewer input climatic data is highly desirable,
    especially in the absence of complete climatic parameters. Eddy covariance devices
    or lysimeters can be used to determine ET0 (Vickers 2017). Nevertheless, field
    measurements of ET0 via lysimeters and Eddy Covariance systems are inefficient,
    costly, and time-consuming. In addition, their effectiveness depends on the precise
    and accurate planning of experiments (López-Urrea et al. 2006). Consequently,
    remote sensing has been used and improved to estimate ET0 at various spatial scales
    for decades (Borel 2003). There has been a significant amount of research concerning
    the estimation of ET0 using limited data on the ground. These studies led to the
    development of several methods for estimating ET0, including Hargreaves and Samani,
    Priestley–Taylor, and Thornthwaite equations (Jabloun and Sahli 2008; Tomas-Burguera
    et al. 2017). These equations, based on limited meteorological data, can be used
    in the estimation of ET0 as a result of reasonable correlation coefficients and
    root-mean-square errors. Due to their nonlinear, non-stationary, and stochastic
    nature, meteorological variables are dynamic. The complexity of evapotranspiration
    requires techniques beyond those available in empirical models. Therefore, to
    develop ET0 models in a new pattern, artificial intelligence approaches were introduced.
    Several machine learning practices have been introduced in recent years to enable
    the accurate calculation of ET0 by using a variety of approaches (Bai et al. 2021;
    Samadianfard and Panahi 2019; Shamshirband et al. 2020). The ET0 model proposed
    by Falamarzi et al. (2014) was based solely on temperature and wind speed data
    and was successful in modeling ET0 using an artificial and wavelet neural network
    in Australia. Using a limited set of meteorological data, Feng et al. (2016) demonstrated
    acceptable accuracy in ET0 estimation using extreme learning machines (ELMs) and
    artificial neural networks optimized by genetic algorithms (GANNs). Additionally,
    a number of practical approaches have been developed that utilize remote sensing
    data rather than meteorological data to estimate ET0 despite the lack of meteorological
    stations. Leaf area indices (LAI), land surface temperatures (LST), fraction of
    photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI), and vegetation types can be remotely sensed from satellites to provide
    continuous temporally and spatially continuous information on the biophysical
    properties of the land surface (Huete et al. 2002; Los et al. 2000; Myneni et
    al. 2002; Wan et al. 2002). Satellite remote sensing provides an effective method
    for measuring long-term surface temperature over wide areas compared to traditional
    ground-based measurements (Duan et al. 2017). The results of Maeda et al. (2011)
    showed a correlation coefficient of 0.67 using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer) LST as a replacement for atmospheric temperature in temperature-based
    ET0 models. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few types of research
    evaluating the potential of machine learning models for estimating ET0 based on
    remote sensing data in regions with a variety of climate zones. Most of the researches
    focuses on meteorological data. So, in the current study, (1) a comprehensive
    evaluation was conducted on two models, namely the optimization algorithm of stochastic
    gradient descent (SGD-MLP) and multilayer perceptron artificial neural network
    (MLP) implementing only remote sensing data for estimating daily ET0 within two
    different climate zones. (2) Various combinations of remote sensing data were
    used to evaluate proposed ET0 estimation models. (3) Examining the relationship
    between input parameters obtained from satellite images and ET0 was done in two
    different climates. Materials and methods Study area In the present study, two
    different agro-climatic zones, including Tabriz and Babolsar stations, were selected
    in Iran. The climatic characteristics and location specifications of the two mentioned
    stations are presented in Table 1. The location maps of the selected stations
    are also shown in Fig. 1. During the time period 2003–2021, Tabriz and Babolsar
    stations had average annual rainfall of 262 mm and 889 mm, respectively, with
    average annual temperatures of 13.44 °C and 17.87 °C. As defined by the De Martonne
    classification method, Tabriz is classified as a semi-arid climate region, while
    Babolsar is classified as a humid climate region. Table 1 The study locations
    and their climatic characteristics Full size table Fig. 1 Location of the study
    sites Full size image Overview To estimate daily ET0 in Tabriz and Babolsar stations,
    the following input variables were used: land surface temperature (LST) day and
    night, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and
    a fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) from MODIS sensor. So,
    data were collected in the time period of 2003–2021. In other words, ET0 is computed
    using machine learning algorithms based on remote sensing data to identify the
    relationships between remote sensing data and ET0 (calculated by meteorology station
    data). Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the model. A daily dataset from the
    MODIS sensor is required to estimate ET0 in this study. This research utilized
    4-day LAI, FPAR, and 16-day NDVI data, so they need to be reconstructed and converted
    into daily data. In this case, cubic spline interpolation has been applied. To
    reconstruct the MODIS LST day/night data and correct the missing data due to atmospheric
    disturbances and dust, Terra and Aqua satellites'' 1-day data were combined first
    to reduce the number of missing data; then, the Kalman filter was used to reconstruct
    the 1-day data. Fig. 2 Establishment and application process of the model Full
    size image FAO-Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) A standard method for estimating ET0 is
    the FAO-PM equation. FAO-PM was calculated using Eq. (1). $$ ET_{0} = \\frac{{0.408\\Delta
    \\left( {R_{n} - G} \\right) + \\gamma \\frac{900}{{T_{\\min } + 273}}U_{2} \\left(
    {e_{s} - e_{a} } \\right)}}{{\\Delta + \\gamma \\left( {1 + 0.34U_{2} } \\right)}}
    $$ (1) where ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration (mm d−1), Δ is the slope
    of the saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa ∘C−1) at the daily mean air temperature
    (∘C), Rn and G are the net solar radiation and soil heat flux density (MJ m−2
    d−1), γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa ∘C−1), T is the daily mean temperature
    (∘C), U2 is the mean wind speed (ms−1), es is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and ea is the actual vapor pressure (kPa) (Allen et al. 1998). Remote sensing
    data MODIS is a NASA satellite sensor used to monitor Earth’s environment onboard
    Terra and Aqua (launched in 1999 and 2002, respectively). Terra passes the equator
    at approximately 10:30 AM local time from north to south. Aqua crosses the equator
    from north to south at approximately 1:30 PM local time (Pagano and Durham 1993).
    Multiple bands of the MODIS sensor are capable of resolving spatial resolutions
    of 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km. Land surface conditions have been monitored by satellite
    observations for many years. As well as providing access to valuable data for
    regions without land observations, these observations also have the advantage
    of offering wide coverage. It would be possible to access a wide range of commonly
    Landsat and MODIS were used as remote sensing products, easily through their respective
    Google Earth Engine (GEE) applications (Amani et al. 2020; Moore and Hansen 2011;
    Tamiminia et al. 2020). Despite the lower temporal resolution of remote sensing
    data, ET0 can be estimated with the daily MODIS datasets (Kim et al. 2020). Terra
    and Aqua MODIS products, which were used in the current study, include LST day
    and night as well as NDVI, LAI, and FPAR (Table 2). Table 2 Remote sensing data

    Data pre-processing LST An important parameter in the study of land surface processes
    is land surface temperature (LST) (Wan and Li 1997). NASA’s Terra and Aqua Earth
    Observation Systems generate multiple LST products daily with MODIS sensors (Wang
    et al. 2008). During the period 2003 to 2021, LST was downloaded using the thermal
    infrared bands of the Daily Aqua (MYD11A1) and Terra (MOD11A1) satellites. LST
    is available as a daytime and nighttime product with a spatial resolution of 1
    km using the products MYD11A1 and MOD11A1 (Zhu et al. 2013). Three types of LST
    were tested to assess the remote sensing-based ET0 estimation model. The first
    model used a combination of Aqua and Terra products daytime LST (LSTday), the
    second model was based on the combination, of Aqua and Terra products nighttime
    LST (LSTnight), and the third model utilized the average LST of day and night
    (LSTmean). Also, because LST values are often affected by clouds and other atmospheric
    disturbances, the results have more missing data (Yu et al. 2015). Due to the
    fact that clouds are constantly moving in both position and extent, one pixel
    that is cloudy in the morning (10:30 AM, Terra overpass time) may appear clear
    in the afternoon (1:30 PM, Aqua overpass time). The combination of Terra and Aqua
    products, under most meteorological conditions, would therefore provide cloudless
    composited images every day (Xie et al. 2009). Thus, Aqua and Terra products were
    combined, implementing the imputeTS library in R programming (Moritz and Bartz-Beielstein
    2017), and time series data were reconstructed using Kalman filter interpolation
    (Andronis et al. 2022). The mentioned procedure is described in Table 3 for combining
    the LST of the Aqua and Terra satellites. Fig. 3 Three-dimensional bar graphs
    of the statistical parameters Tabriz and Babolsar station Full size image NDVI,
    LAI, and FPAR Vegetation vitality is measured by the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI). During this study, the MYD13Q1 V6 16-day product with a resolution
    of 250 m was used. Vegetation index (VI) values are provided for each pixel in
    the MYD13Q1 V6 product (El-Shirbeny et al. 2022). There are a number of vegetation
    indices available, but NDVI is one of the most widely used (D''Odorico et al.
    2013). In the current research, the cubic spline method was used to convert the
    16-day product into daily values since vegetation greenness generally changes
    over a year in the form of a cosine curve (Kim et al. 2020). An alternative method
    of estimating leaf biomass is to use the leaf area index (LAI), which is based
    on a crop-specific growth coefficient and maximum gross primary production (GPP).
    The fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is the portion of photosynthetically
    active radiation absorbed by green vegetation. In this study, to obtain LAI and
    FPAR values, the MCD15A3H V6 level 4, 4-day product with a resolution of 500 m
    was used. Dataset MCD15A3H V6 level 4 contains pixel sizes of 500 m for a composite
    4-day period. Based on all the measurements taken by NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites
    over a period of 4 days, the algorithm in its algorithmic form picks the best
    pixel available from all the acquisitions from both MODIS sensors located on those
    satellites (Zhen et al. 2021). The 4-day LAI and FPAR data were converted to daily
    data using cubic spline interpolation (Chen et al. 2006). Multilayer perceptron
    (MLP) In hydrologic modeling, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been extensively
    applied to capture and demonstrate intricate input/output interactions. An ANN
    consists of a collection of nodes (neurons) organized into layers and linked via
    weights. Three layers are required for a simple neural network to function: the
    input layer (information), the hidden layers (secret information), and the output
    layer (yield). It is the input layer that presents the input information in the
    modeling process. The neural network then functions on this information to produce
    the output, which is achieved at the layer of output. Neurons with weighted networks
    provide many inputs to each neuron. As the weighted inputs are added up, a transmission
    function is constructed, for example, a linear, logistic, or hyperbolic tangent
    function (Talebizadeh et al. 2010). Because the ANN does not require comprehensive
    statistics regarding the physical process prevailing in the systems, it is an
    effective method for analyzing complex hydrological processes. Several studies
    have utilized a variety of ANNs and training algorithms (Shadkani et al. 2021).
    The multilayer perceptron (MLP) method is the most commonly used ANN method in
    hydrological research. There are two categories of ANNs, feed-forward and backward,
    depending upon the direction of data transmission and processing. MLPs are part
    of a feed-forward network. According to previous studies, MLP networks can properly
    estimate nonlinear functions with a high level of accuracy (Schalkoff 1997). Multilayer
    perceptron networks were used in the current research, and backpropagation was
    used for training the neural network. The MLP method is expressed as follows:
    $$ Y = F\\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{m} W_{kj} .F\\left( {\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} W_{ji} X_{i} + B_{j} } \\right) + B_{k} } \\right)
    $$ (2) Wkj represents the weights between hidden layers and output layers; Wji
    is used to represent weights between hidden and output layers; Xi represents the
    input variables; m refers to the number of hidden layer neurons; the number of
    neurons in the input layer is n; in the hidden layer, Bj represents the bias amount
    of the neuron; in the output layer, Bk represents the bias amount of the neurons;
    Y represents the output function; F represents the transmission function. ANNs
    are often activated by using a sigmoid function. Sigmoid (Sig) functions were
    used in the current study. For different Z values, the Sig transmission function
    is as follows: $$ F\\left( Z \\right) = \\frac{1}{{1 + \\exp \\left( { - Z} \\right)}}
    $$ (3) Multilayer perceptron-stochastic gradient descent (SGD-MLP) A stochastic
    gradient descent algorithm (SGD) simplifies a problem by computing the gradient
    of the objective function based on a small subset that is chosen by chance (Bottou
    2010). The number of training datasets used for a single iteration determines
    the batch size. In order to accelerate convergence, a small batch size can enable
    parameter updates more frequently than gradient descent. The maximum frequency
    of updates and simple perceptron-like algorithm are provided by batch sizes of
    1. SGD approximates the gradient of the objective function given by Eq. 4 by randomly
    selecting a small subset of the training samples. The batch size is the number
    of training samples used. SGD training is slow to converge when the batch size
    is N. One can speed up convergence by updating the parameters more frequently
    with a small batch size than with gradient descent. When the batch size is 1,
    the maximum frequency of updates is achieved, and it is a straightforward perceptron-like
    operation. $$ L_{w} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{N} L\\left( {j,w} \\right)
    - C\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i} \\left| {\\omega_{i} } \\right| $$ (4) where C
    is the meta-parameter that controls the degree of regularization, which is usually
    tuned by cross-validation or using the held-out data, N is the number of training
    samples, and \\({\\omega }_{i}\\) is the weight of the feature. As long as a single
    training sample is used to approximate the gradient, the optimization procedure
    is identical to simple gradient descent, so the weights of the features are updated
    as follows at training sample j: (Eq. 5) $$\\omega^{k + 1} = \\omega^{k} + \\eta_{k}
    \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\omega }\\;\\left(K\\left( j.\\omega \\right) -
    \\frac{C}{N}\\sum_{i} \\left| \\omega_{i} \\right| \\right)$$ (5) The SGD-MLP
    method is a neural network-based model which is optimized using SGD. Among the
    advanced features of SGD''s algorithm are epochs, rho, L1 or L2 adjustment, momentum
    training, adaptive learning rate, and rate annealing that provide high accuracy
    in prediction when using MLP models. Aside from optimizing MLP results with SGD,
    the network also contains hidden layers containing neurons with tanh (hyperbolic
    tangent function), rectifier (where x is the input value, select the maximum of
    (0, x)), max out (select the maximum input vector coordinates), and ExpRectifier
    (exponential rectifier function). When the adaptive learning rate is inactivated,
    the user-determined learning rate describes the size of the weight updates based
    on the difference between the predicted and target values. The variance is referred
    to as the delta, which is only shown at the output layer. The output of each hidden
    layer is estimated accurately using backpropagation. Considering that redundant
    momentum may cause oscillations, momentum is ramped up gradually. The rate annealing,
    momentum training, dropout rate annealing, and momentum training parameters are
    activated if the adaptive learning rate is disabled. Evaluation criteria In the
    current study, four performance indexes, including the coefficient of determination
    (R2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), Willmott’s index of agreement (WI), and
    Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NS), are utilized to measure the model’s accuracy.
    The mathematical description of R2, RMSE, WI, and NS can be expressed, respectively,
    as follows: $$ R^{2} = 1 - \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left(
    {{\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left( {{\\text{observed}}} \\right)}} - {\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left(

    \\left( {{\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left( {{\\text{observed}}} \\right)}} - \\overline{{{\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left(

    {\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left( {{\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left(
    {{\\text{observed}}} \\right)}} - {\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left( {{\\text{model}}} \\right)}}
    } \\right)^{2} } $$ (7) $$ {\\text{WI}} = 1 - \\left[ {\\frac{{\\mathop \\sum

    }} } \\right| + \\left| {{\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left( {{\\text{observed}}} \\right)}}
    - \\overline{{{\\text{ET}}_{{i\\left( {{\\text{observed}}} \\right)}} }} } \\right|}
    \\right)^{2} }}} \\right] $$ (8) $$ {\\text{NS}} = 1 - \\left[ {\\frac{{\\mathop

    for two different agro-climatic zones Input variables from satellite images were
    combined to estimate ET0 at Tabriz (semi-arid climate) and Babolsar (humid climate)
    stations using an optimization algorithm of SGD and MLP. Table 4 shows the input
    parameters for each model. There are three models: first is based on the land
    surface temperature, second on the vegetation indices, and third is a combination
    of the land surface temperature and the vegetation indices. Table 4 The input
    combinations of the studied models Full size table The results of the statistical
    parameters for the two mentioned stations are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 3. With
    all considered parameters, ET0 was estimated with the best accuracy at the two
    studied stations. The first scenario performs better than the second based on
    a comparison of the input parameters at both stations. Accordingly, the effect
    of LST on estimating ET0 is higher than the effect of vegetation indices. Also,
    model performance can be affected by cloudy weather. Cloudy weather reduces the
    accuracy of satellite image parameters. However, LST data are more affected by
    sky cloudiness than vegetation indexes. Table 6 shows the number of missing LST
    data for the two mentioned stations obtained from MODIS sensors. It also shows
    the average of cloudy hours derived from meteorological station data for 2003–2021
    for these two stations. Based on Tables 5 and 6, the lower accuracy of the statistical
    parameters at Babolsar station is attributed to a large number of missing LST
    data and more cloudy hours than at Tabriz station. In addition, the SGD-MLP-3
    provided the most accurate results during the testing period, i.e., R2, RMSE,
    NS, and WI, as 0.949, 0.417 mm/day, 0.894, and 0.973 for Tabriz and 0.864, 0.754
    mm/day, 0.742, and 0.922 for Babolsar station, respectively. In addition, the
    MLP-3 algorithm showed weaker performance than the hybrid SGD-MLP models with
    the performance indices, R2, RMSE, NS, and WI, as 0.939, 0.449 mm/day, 0.877,
    and 0.969 for Tabriz and 0.847, 0.804 mm/day, 0.706, and 0.911 for Babolsar station.

    In order to evaluate the algorithms and models, a radar chart was used to evaluate
    the best-calculated values of RMSE (mm/day) for all constructed models. The obtained
    results for Tabriz and Babolsar stations are shown in Fig. 2. A hexagon with a
    smaller RMSE value indicates the best performance of the station. Based on Fig.
    4, all models (SGD-MLP and MLP) at Tabriz station predicted ET0 values more accurately
    than those at Babolsar station. Further, Fig. 3 shows that SGD-MLP-3 performed
    better at both stations than the other models in estimating ET0 values. Fig. 4
    FAO-PM vs. estimated daily ET0 values by the SGD-MLP and MLP algorithms during
    the testing period (2017–2021) at Tabriz and Babolsar station Full size image
    Moreover, Fig. 4 displays scatter plots of FAO-PM ET0 values and estimated ET0
    by SGD-MLP and MLP models. The regression line in the scatter plots provides the
    coefficient of determination (R2) for both models. At both stations (Tabriz and
    Babolsar), SGD-MLP-3 (all input parameters) produced more accurate ET0 values.
    A comparison of all input parameters for two stations with the MLP algorithm demonstrated
    a lower level of accuracy. Further, the models overestimated ET0 values at Babolsar
    station as the regression line is above the 1:1 line. In order to evaluate the
    models, a radar chart was used to evaluate the best-calculated values of RMSE
    (mm/day) for all constructed models (Fig. 5). A hexagon with a smaller RMSE value
    indicates the best performance of the station. So, it can be concluded that all
    models (SGD-MLP and MLP) at Tabriz station estimated ET0 values more accurately
    than those at Babolsar station. Moreover, Fig. 4 reveals that SGD-MLP-3 estimated
    ET0 values better than other established models at both stations. Fig. 5 The best-calculated
    values of RMSE (mm day-1) for Tabriz and Babolsar stations are shown on this radar
    chart Full size image By comparing root-mean-square error, standard deviation,
    and correlation coefficient, Taylor’s diagram provides a reliable comparison of
    different models’ performance. At Tabriz and Babolsar stations, the superiority
    of SGD-MLP and MLP models with different input variables was investigated using
    the Taylor diagram (Fig. 6). In the Taylor diagram, the red square represents
    FAO-PM''s daily ET0. Generally, models near the red square are considered to be
    more accurate. Based on Fig. 6, MLP-3 and MLP-SGD-3 offer the weakest and most
    accurate estimates of ET0 in both stations. Additionally, the accuracy of ET0
    estimation at Tabriz station is better than that at Babolsar station across all
    models. Fig. 6 Taylor diagrams for ET0 estimates for both models based on three
    scenarios at two stations Full size image Figure 7 shows the estimated daily ET0
    by SGD-MLP-3 at Tabriz and Babolsar stations in the time period of 2017–2021.
    The estimate of ET0 illustrated in Fig. 7 reflects the same trend as the observed
    ET0 calculated using the FAO-PM and ground meteorological observations at two
    locations. Fig. 7 Evaluation of best algorithms SGD-MLP-3 (for Model-3) at Tabriz
    (semi-arid climate) and Babolsar (humid climate) station Full size image In Table
    7, the cross-correlation between the input parameters and the target is shown.
    There is a strong relationship between the LSTmean in Tabriz station and the FAO-PM
    ET0 based on all of the studied inputs (R = 0.792). Moreover, the NDVI at Babolsar
    station has a weak relationship with the goal variable (R = 0.196). According
    to the results of current research, the land surface temperature (day, night,
    and average) in both stations have a stronger relationship with ET0 than vegetation
    indices. Also, due to the high number of cloudy days at the Babolsar station and
    the low quality of the satellite images, the correlation of all parameters is
    lower than correspondent values at Tabriz station. The results of previous studies
    were also compared with the findings of the current research. Using artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) and remote sensing data, Chen et al. (2013) developed a
    model to estimate daily evapotranspiration (ET). Surface net radiation, normalized
    difference vegetation index, and land surface temperature were derived from satellite
    remotely sensed data. According to their results, there is a coefficient of determination
    of 0.770 between estimated and measured ET values. Moreover, Zhang et al (2018)
    compared the three algorithms of support vector machine (SVM), backpropagation
    neural network (BP), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with different
    combinations of MODIS sensor input variables for estimation of daily ET0 in Northwest
    China. Among the three models, the SVM model with a correlation coefficient of
    0.917 had the best results. The obtained results in the current study are consistent
    with the mentioned findings. Table 7 The correlation coefficient of input parameters
    with FAO-PM ET0 Full size table Conclusion For agricultural activities, estimating
    ET0 is crucial. Through satellite data with a high temporal resolution, new insights
    can now be gained into agriculture. Consequently, satellite images provide an
    opportunity to determine the most critical ET0-related parameters, including LST
    during the day, NDVI, LAI, and FPAR from the MODIS sensor. The present study used
    satellite images to estimate ET0 in croplands of Tabriz (semi-arid climate) and
    Babolsar (humid climate) stations, Iran, using MLP and SGD-MLP models. A training
    dataset from 2003 to 2016 was used for training, and a testing dataset from 2017
    to 2021 was used for testing. According to the obtained results, the SGD-MLP-3
    gave the most accurate results with values of performance R2, RMSE, NS, and WI
    as 0.949, 0.417 mm/day, 0.894, and 0.973 for Tabriz and 0.864, 0.754 mm/day, 0.742,
    and 0.922 for Babolsar station, respectively. So, there was a constant trend that
    revealed greater accuracy of both SGD-MLP and MLP models at Tabriz station than
    at Babolsar station. Moreover, at both studied stations, ET0 values were estimated
    more accurately by model SGD-MLP-3. Also, at the Babolsar station, the correlation
    between satellite parameters with ET0 values was lower than Tabriz station due
    to the high number of cloudy days and the low quality of the satellite images.
    In conclusion, the implementation of hybrid SGD-MLP models utilizing satellite
    image parameters was recommended for ET0 estimation, especially in semi-arid regions.

    Location: Giza, Egypt SECTION I. Introduction Drought, issues with crop quality
    and production, and challenges with yield forecast [1] are just some of the issues
    that modern agriculture must contend with. According to United Nations'' Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, the global population will reach
    8 billion by 2025, an increase of three people per second (or 250,000 people per
    day), and rise to an estimated 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. Farmers need to drastically
    expand food production while protecting the environment and efficiently using
    natural resources to keep up with the growing global population. Still, they can
    not achieve this independently, and traditional farming methods are not equipped
    to handle the task. To that end, technological advancements are crucial in meeting
    the global population’s expanding dietary requirements. Farmers need to know how
    much water their crops will use, when that water will be used, and how much water
    will evaporate from the surface of lakes and dams for free [3]. The ultimate goal
    of smart irrigation management is to achieve efficient and effective water use,
    making it an increasingly significant administrative activity. Good irrigation
    management aims to apply the appropriate amount of water at the appropriate time.
    New and improved technologies are helping the vast majority of people in many
    different ways. The Internet of Things (IoT) and data analysis through machine
    learning [4] significantly enhance people’s ability to shape their environments
    in their daily lives. IoT and machine learning are widely used in the agro-industrial
    sector for diagnosing and managing smart irrigation systems, both of which supply
    crucial data for successful farming. Smart irrigation that efficiently uses water
    could benefit from IoT-based solutions, which have already proven useful in many
    areas of the agricultural environment [5]. An intelligent irrigation system must
    consider soil moisture, precipitation, and evaporation. A smart irrigation system
    is proposed in this paper, which would utilize machine learning algorithms and
    the IoT to conserve water and power. Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    rainfall are just some variables the system’s array of sensors may track. A machine
    learning system is fed data from these sensors about the crop moisture level to
    formulate an ideal irrigation schedule. In addition, the system incorporates IoT
    devices, which provide full transparency by enabling remote user control and system
    monitoring. The smart irrigation system is effective because it uses machine learning
    algorithms to analyze crop data in real time and predict plant development and
    harvest. The benefits of the smart irrigation system are discussed in this study
    as well, including decreased water consumption, increased crop production, decreased
    energy consumption, and decreased operational expenses. The rest of this paper
    is organized in the following manner. Section 2 reviews the related work and section
    3 presents the proposed methodology in detail. While section 4 presents the experimental
    evaluation, section 5 presents the system prototype. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in section 6. SECTION II. Related Work IoT, machine learning capabilities, data
    analytics and mining [6], and wireless technologies [7] contribute to developing
    smart agriculture management. Many works presented a lot of suggestions as well
    as several approaches to general agricultural activities that make use of this
    new technology. In [8], an overview of agricultural irrigation systems that use
    the Internet of Things is presented. In their literature study, the authors analyze
    wireless technologies, sensor nodes, and IoT systems alongside the most important
    indicators for characterizing water quality in irrigation, soil, and weather situations
    [9] and discuss the methods used to monitor and manage automated watering systems
    like sprinklers. In order to attain precision irrigation for increased food safety
    and water conservation, the authors offer new insights into how existing monitoring
    and advanced control systems might be developed. Critical agricultural applications
    are identified and examined, and the potential of IoT technology, practices, and
    future research are all explored in [10]. The research projects reviewed the state
    of the art in smart agriculture monitoring in both laboratory and field settings.
    In [11], a mathematical model was provided for corn tempering drying that considers
    the thermo-physical heterogeneity of the kernel’s components. In [12], an infrastructure
    for implementing smart irrigation systems was presented, utilizing LoRaWAN and
    fog computing. In order to determine when to irrigate, the proposed system exploited
    IoT nodes that communicate with nearby fog computing nodes and a distant cloud.
    No system has been proposed where data can be stored and tracked locally. According
    to the results of their analysis, cloud computing is more expensive. In [13],
    a Windows GUI program was described for multifractal analysis of soil and plant
    structures. In [14], a user-friendly smartphone app, REUTIVAR-App, was introduced
    for fertigation scheduling in olive trees with recycled water. Farm-scale irrigation
    and fertilization recommendations are also tracked daily in real-time as part
    of their research. However, the study did not focus on IoT uses. In proposing
    an IoT platform, the authors in [15] showed how to collect, analyze, and visualize
    sensor data for use in smart farming. In [16], a proposal was made for monitoring
    environmental parameters in chicken farms using inexpensive gear and software.
    Several experiments were also conducted to contrast the proposed prototype with
    existing commercial options. Intending to realize long-term and cost-effective
    monitoring, the authors in [17] proposed a soil environment monitoring system
    based on RFID sensors and LoRa for tracking soil’s temperature, moisture level,
    and chloride ion concentration. The authors of [18] present a method for recommending
    when and how much water should be used for irrigation by combining agglomerative
    clustering with machine learning methods like regression trees and support vector
    machines. The recommendation system did well on its collected data set and the
    publically available agricultural data set. The authors of [19] created an IoT
    and a data-driven irrigation system. Predictions of soil moisture content are
    performed using this method and compared to those made using alternative state-space
    models. Results show that the suggested strategy outperforms the status quo, and
    predictions for soil moisture content are positive. Since a water resource is
    most misused in irrigation, monitoring and controlling the agricultural field
    or irrigation are key factors to be met in an efficient, smart irrigation system
    [20]. The widespread availability of mobile phones makes this possibility possible.
    For off-site, real-time field data monitoring, an IoT-based strategy was developed
    and operated [21]. In [22], the authors proposed a system that used the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform based on the IoT to enable remote monitoring and control of the
    irrigation system. By allowing for remote monitoring and control, the system made
    the farmer’s job easier in terms of optimizing the irrigation system. Incorporating
    foresight utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence is a hot topic
    of study. Modern irrigation techniques are necessary to prevent water shortages
    [23]. The next section details the suggested methodology and the basic prerequisites
    needed to implement it. In order to predict the agronomist’s irrigation suggestions,
    this study [24] set out to establish a model that incorporates his irrigation
    planning process. Machine learning techniques applied to an integrated dataset
    from multiple sources allowed us to accomplish our goal. The dataset included
    agronomist-determined irrigation levels and sensor-based characteristics, weather-based
    features, and features describing plots. Three machine learning techniques, the
    standard linear regression, the nonparametric gradient boosted regression trees,
    and the nonparametric boosted trees classifiers, were used to build various irrigation
    recommendation prediction models utilizing this comprehensive dataset. Eight distinct
    feature subsets were used to train the models. Predicting agricultural yields
    and water availability using a hybrid of the wrapper feature selection methodology
    and the PART classification technique is offered [25], called WPART. There are
    four phases to the proposed system: the first is data collection, wherein environmental
    indicator data is gathered via the IoT system; the second is data preprocessing;
    the third is feature selection, wherein the wrapper feature selection approach
    is used to analyze environmental indicators and select the effective indicators
    of the farming system; and the fourth is drought prediction, wherein PART supervised
    machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the selected indicators. SECTION
    III. The Proposed System Architecture Figure 1 depicts the proposed system’s design.
    There are three phases: Data collection, ML model building, API integration, and
    irrigation scheduling. The watering scheduler is improved by the data fusion model
    used in the cloud service. The data model can be customized for various use cases
    by selecting and feeding in data from specialized domains of knowledge. In addition,
    the watering schedule may be monitored and adjusted remotely using a web interface.
    Fig. 1. The proposed system architecture Show All A. Data collection The smart
    irrigation system comprises various components for efficient data collection.
    Sensors such as a soil moisture sensor and a DH11 sensor for temperature and humidity
    air measurements are deployed in the field. These sensors are connected to an
    Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the central control unit. The microcontroller
    collects real-time data from the sensors, facilitating data processing and communication
    with other system components. A Node MCU is also utilized to establish an internet
    connection, enabling data transmission to the cloud. The collected sensor data,
    including soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity, is stored in a database
    server, providing a reliable and scalable solution for data management. B. ML
    model building Once the data is collected from the sensors and stored in the database
    server, it is transmitted to the cloud for processing and analysis. In the cloud-based
    environment, data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to ensure its optimal quality
    and relevance, a crucial step given the significance of smart irrigation systems.
    The initial phase involves addressing missing values, often a result of intermittent
    connectivity or sensor malfunctions. To achieve uniformity in the disparate measurements,
    data such as temperature and humidity are standardized using Min-Max scaling.
    Further, categorical variables, like soil types, undergo a transformation process
    called one-hot encoding, making them digestible for machines without implying
    any ordinal significance. A pivotal step in the preprocessing journey is the partitioning
    of data into training and test subsets. This division is paramount to avert overfitting,
    a situation where a model might excel on its training data but falter drastically
    with unfamiliar data. By training the model on one subset and testing it on an
    unseen one, a more realistic gauge of the model’s performance in real-world scenarios
    is achieved. Once preprocessed, the data is utilized to train a machine learning
    model hosted in the cloud, with the test data serving the purpose of model evaluation.
    The cloud platform also hosts an API for users to access system functionalities.
    It stores and manages the system’s data, ensuring scalability, reliability, and
    security. Additionally, it enables integration with other services and applications,
    acting as a centralized hub for data processing, analysis, and decision-making
    in the smart irrigation system. Once the collected sensor data goes through a
    comprehensive analysis process in the cloud platform, the smart irrigation system
    leverages the power of machine learning to ensure accurate and efficient irrigation
    decisions. A labeled dataset is then prepared, incorporating historical sensor
    data and corresponding irrigation procedures, providing valuable insights into
    when to activate or deactivate irrigation based on sensor readings. The machine
    learning model is trained to capture the intricate relationships between sensor
    readings and irrigation requirements using sophisticated machine learning algorithms
    such as decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), or logistic regression
    (LR). Once trained, the model is deployed in the cloud platform, enabling real-time
    inference for predicting optimal irrigation actions based on the learned patterns
    and relationships. This intelligent decision-making significantly improves water
    efficiency and empowers farmers with precise and timely irrigation strategies.
    C. API integration API integration is critical in enabling real-time decision-making
    for irrigation control in a smart irrigation system. By integrating machine learning
    models with a cloud server through APIs, the system can harness the power of data
    analysis and predictive algorithms to optimize irrigation operations. Users can
    retrieve sensor readings, watering recommendations, and system configurations
    through an API. It allows users to access real-time data, monitor sensor readings,
    configure irrigation settings, and switch between manual and automatic modes.
    The API provides a unified interface, enabling seamless integration with external
    services or applications. This integration allows users to interact with the system
    and make informed decisions. The API serves as a key component to share data,
    control the system, and facilitate smart irrigation system integration with other
    systems or applications. D. Irrigation scheduling The smart irrigation system
    works automatically by harnessing the power of machine learning. By integrating
    machine learning models with the system, it is automatically decides to pump or
    not without user intervention. In addition to its automatic capabilities, the
    smart irrigation system also provides manual control through an IoT cloud Arduino
    service, such as a web application. Users can access the web application interface,
    which allows them to monitor sensor readings, adjust irrigation settings, and
    manually control irrigation actions. By selecting the manual mode and using the
    web application, users can override the automatic irrigation decisions made by
    the machine learning models. They have the flexibility to customize irrigation
    parameters based on their preferences or specific crop needs. For instance, users
    can choose to activate or deactivate the irrigation system, adjust the watering
    duration, or set specific irrigation schedules. The manual control feature provides
    users with a higher level of control and adaptability, allowing them to fine-tune
    the irrigation process to suit their specific requirements or respond to unexpected
    environmental changes. SECTION IV. Results and discussions A. Dataset profiling
    The dataset consists of six attributes; CropType, CropDays, SoilMoisture, Temperature,
    Humidity, and Irrigation. The dataset attributes description is depicted in Table
    1. The dataset \"Crop Irrigation Scheduling,\" used in this work, was downloaded
    from Kaggle [26]. TABLE 1. The dataset attributes description Irrigation decisions
    are crucial in agriculture to ensure that crops receive the right amount of water
    at the right time. This attribute may contain data or actions related to irrigation
    management. These attributes collectively provide essential information for managing
    and optimizing crop cultivation, irrigation, and overall agricultural practices.
    They are valuable for making data-driven decisions in agriculture and optimizing
    crop yield and quality. B. Results When comparing the results of decision trees,
    logistic regression, and vector machine support models, their performance based
    on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are analyzed. The experimental evaluation
    method is the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 2 for the classifier decision tree,
    as an example. The mentioned evaluation measures are computed from the confusion
    matrix [27]. Fig. 2. The confusion matrix of the decision tree classifier Show
    All The values of computed evaluation measures, accuracy, precision, recall, and
    f1 score are depicted in Table 2. Table 2. The performance measures of different
    classification model Based on these comparisons, the DT model performs better
    overall, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-score for the results as shown
    in the Fig. 3. In the development of our smart irrigation system using IoT and
    machine learning techniques, the Decision Tree classifier played a pivotal role
    in decision-making processes, achieving the highest performance. While various
    training parameters can be adjusted to refine the performance of Decision Trees,
    for the scope of this study, we relied on the default parameters to ensure consistency
    and replicability. Specifically, the criterion for the quality of a split was
    set to \"gini\" which measures the impurity of the data, the maximum depth of
    the tree was left undefined allowing the tree to expand until all leaves are pure,
    the minimum samples split was set to 2, and the minimum samples leaf was set to
    1. By employing these default values, a foundational benchmark for the system’s
    performance is established, which can serve as a reference point for future iterations
    and optimizations. C. Comparison with literature This section presents and discusses
    a comparison with work in the literature that is related to our proposed method.
    In the realm of agri-tech, our work underscores the promise of combining IoT with
    machine learning. Iorliam et al. [28] tested various models on IoT-based irrigation
    data, where logistic regression reached 71.76% accuracy, and the support vector
    machine achieved 90.21%. Interestingly, our decision trees model’s 89.68% accuracy
    is nearly on par with their SVM results. Tas et al. [29] crafted a versatile,
    efficient irrigation system. Using sensors to track soil humidity, temperature,
    and rain, they tested several models. The KNN model was most impressive, with
    a 98.3% accuracy and 0.12 RMSE. Notably, their dataset differs from ours. Research
    [30] proposed an advanced Irrigation Water Quality Prediction (IWQP) model utilizing
    convolutional neural architectures. When stacked against Logistic Regression (LR),
    Support Vector Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), their approach
    leaned more towards traditional machine learning, aligning with low-capability
    IoT devices. Mishra and Somkunwar [31] advocated for logistic regression in smart
    irrigation, considering various parameters. In comparison, our various models,
    including logistic regression, could be marginally (0.0553%) more precise. Fig.
    3. The comparison between DT, SVM and LR Show All SECTION V. System Prototyping
    As shown in Fig. 4, a system prototype is presented that synergizes IoT technology
    and machine learning to optimize water usage and augment crop yield. By seamlessly
    integrating sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud connectivity, the prototype
    continuously monitors and analyzes environmental data to generate adaptive irrigation
    schedules. Through real-time decision-making and remote control functionality,
    the objective is to enhance sustainability and efficiency in agricultural practices.
    The prototype of the smart irrigation system was meticulously implemented in a
    small house garden, effectively demonstrating its practicality and efficacy within
    a confined space. The primary aim was to develop a compact and efficient system
    that could be effortlessly installed and operated by homeowners. The smart irrigation
    system comprised the following components: First: Hardware Components Microcontroller

    of the system. It established seamless communication with the sensors, executed
    the irrigation control algorithm, and orchestrated the overall functionality of
    the system. IoT Connectivity: The prototype employed a wireless module, specifically
    NodeMCU ESP8266, to establish robust connectivity between the microcontroller

    Sensor: Strategically positioned soil moisture sensors accurately measure the
    moisture content in different areas of the garden. Real-time data from these sensors
    served as vital input for the irrigation control algorithm. Temperature and Humidity
    Sensors: Additional sensors were deployed to meticulously monitor environmental
    conditions, including temperature and humidity. These sensors provided essential
    information for determining optimal watering requirements based on prevailing
    weather conditions. Water Pump: A compact water pump was seamlessly integrated
    into the system to ensure efficient water delivery to the plants. Upon detecting
    the need for irrigation based on sensor readings, the microcontroller promptly
    activated the water pump to supply water to the garden. Power Supply: A consistent
    power supply was ensured to facilitate uninterrupted operation of the microcontroller
    and sensors. Second: Software Components Machine Learning Algorithms: The prototype
    harnessed advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively analyze sensor data
    and make accurate predictions and decisions regarding irrigation schedules. These
    algorithms were meticulously trained using historical data to discern irrigation
    patterns and optimize watering schedules based on the unique requirements of different
    crop types. Arduino IoT Cloud: The Arduino IoT Cloud platform served as the central
    hub for efficient data management and seamless system control. It empowered users
    with real-time monitoring capabilities, robust data storage, and remote access
    to system configurations through an intuitive user interface. API Integration:
    To enhance system flexibility and enable seamless interaction with external systems,
    we developed a custom API. This API facilitated effortless customization, scalability,
    and potential integration with other agricultural management systems. Its functionality
    included facilitating the retrieval of sensor readings, configuration of irrigation
    settings, and real-time interaction with the system. During the development of
    the prototype, we meticulously integrated the hardware and software components
    to create a cohesive and seamlessly functioning system. The microcontroller served
    as the intelligent core, effectively receiving data from the sensors and executing
    the irrigation control algorithm based on the trained machine learning models.
    IoT connectivity enabled robust communication between the microcontroller and
    the cloud platform, facilitating uninterrupted data transmission and remote access
    to the system. The software components, comprising machine learning algorithms
    and the Arduino IoT Cloud, worked synergistically to analyze sensor data, make
    real-time decisions, and provide users with a user-friendly interface for monitoring
    and controlling the irrigation system. The seamless integration of the hardware
    and software components ensured the smooth operation of the prototype. Sensor
    data collected by the hardware components served as critical input for the machine
    learning algorithms, which generated precise irrigation schedules tailored to
    the specific requirements of different crop types. The Arduino IoT Cloud platform
    facilitated real-time monitoring, data storage, and remote access, empowering
    users to interact with the system and make necessary adjustments as per their
    needs. The API integration further enhanced system flexibility and potential for
    integration with other agricultural management systems. Fig. 4. The prototype
    of the proposed system Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In conclusion, this research

    the support vector machine (0.8415) in this comparison of machine learning techniques''
    efficacy. In comparison to logistic regression and support vector machine techniques,
    the decision tree approach has a greater precision (0.0553 vs. 0.0454). The prototype

  title: Smart irrigation system using IoT and machine learning methods
  verbatim_quote1: '"This innovative system is the utilization of a carefully curated
    dataset, \"Crop Irrigation Scheduling,\"sourced from Kaggle. This dataset comprises
    six crucial attributes: Crop Type, Crop Days, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity,
    and Irrigation. These attributes, described in detail in the dataset’s metadata,
    provide the foundational information required for precise irrigation management."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The system operates seamlessly by deploying IoT sensors to collect
    real-time data from the field. This data is then preprocessed to ensure its quality
    and consistency. Subsequently, a machine learning model is trained using this
    dataset to make intelligent irrigation decisions in real time. The model’s predictions
    are seamlessly integrated with control mechanisms that govern the irrigation process.'
  verbatim_quote3: '>'
- analysis: '**Relevance**: The paper addresses the point by providing insights into
    the performance of a multi-sensor capacitance probe in estimating soil water content,
    a crucial aspect of irrigation management data collection. However, the paper
    does not specifically discuss the considerations related to the volume, frequency,
    format, and source of the data, limiting its relevance to the specific point within
    the broader review intention.


    **Insight**: While the paper provides valuable information on sensor performance
    under varying clay content and salinity conditions, it offers limited novel or
    groundbreaking insights into data considerations. The findings align with existing
    knowledge on the impact of soil characteristics on sensor accuracy.


    **Credibility**: The paper appears credible as it presents a well-designed study
    with clear methodology and thorough analysis. The authors have utilized appropriate
    experimental techniques and statistical methods to evaluate the sensor''s performance.


    **Scope**: The paper focuses on the performance of a specific multi-sensor capacitance
    probe and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of different types of sensors
    or data collection methods. Its scope is limited to the evaluation of a single
    sensor technology.


    **Recency**: The paper was published in 2023, indicating up-to-date information.
    However, it is worth noting that advancements in soil water sensor technology
    are ongoing, and more recent studies may provide additional insights.


    **Limitations**: The study''s scope is limited to a specific sensor under field
    conditions in western Oklahoma, which may not represent the broader range of soil
    conditions and irrigation practices encountered in real-world applications.'

  description: 'Maintaining the economic and environmental sustainability of crop
    production requires optimizing irrigation management using advanced technologies
    such as soil water sensors. In this study, the performance of a commercially available
    multi-sensor capacitance probe was evaluated under irrigated field conditions
    across western Oklahoma. The effects of clay content and salinity on sensor performance
    were investigated too. In addition, the field capacity (FC) of soil cores collected
    at study sites was determined in the laboratory. These laboratory FC values were
    used to assess the performance of two sensor-based approaches for estimating FC:
    the days to reach laboratory FC after major watering events and the percentile
    of collected sensor readings that represented laboratory FC. The results showed
    that among the six calibrations provided by the manufacturer, the default and
    silty clay loam calibrations produced the largest and smallest soil water content
    errors, respectively. Errors generally increased with clay and salinity, except
    for the heavy clay calibration, which showed improved performance with increasing
    clay content. The default and sand calibrations were more sensitive to increases
    in clay and salinity compared to other calibrations. In the case of sensor-based
    FC, on average, one to three days were required to reach laboratory FC, with a
    large range of one to nine days. The percentiles representing laboratory FC had
    an average of 56% and a range of 3%-97%. Overall, the sensor-based approaches
    produced inconsistent and highly variable estimates of FC.'

- analysis: Combining optical and thermal information obtained from an unmanned aerial

    three vegetation indices (VIs) was evaluated to estimate crop ETc within the framework
    of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach. The combination of NDVI and CWSI
    produced the best estimates of maize ETc with R2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 0.50 mm/day.
    The DACT-based model also performed well, with R2 of 0.77–0.80 and RMSE of 0.53
    mm/day. Although the results varied with irrigation levels, the daily mean bias
    error of ETc predictions over different years indicated acceptable accuracy, with
    an MBE of 0.48 mm/day. Sensitivity analyses indicated that ETc models were most
    sensitive to the slope of the linear regression between Kcb and VIs, followed

  description: Timely and accurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is
    essential for efficient irrigation management at the farmland scale. However,
    effective decision-making for irrigation scheduling requires high spatiotemporal-resolution
    data to provide within-field heterogeneity information. The objective of this
    study was to evaluate the use of optical and thermal information obtained from
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to quantify maize (Zea mays L.) ETc within the
    framework of the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach. Canopy temperature-based
    crop water stress index (CWSI) and number of degrees above canopy threshold (DACT)
    were used to determine the stress coefficient (Ks). Three types of normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and
    enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were adopted to determine basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb). Then the two forms of stress coefficient in combination with three vegetation
    indices (VIs) were evaluated to estimate daily crop ETc under different irrigation
    treatments over two years in the southwest region of Inner Mongolia, China. The
    results demonstrated that the combination of NDVI and CWSI produced the best estimates
    of maize ETc, with R2 of 0.84 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.50 mm/day.
    The DACT-based model also performed well, with R2 of 0.77–0.80 and RMSE of 0.53
    mm/day. Although the results varied with irrigation levels, the daily mean bias
    error of ETc predictions over different years indicated acceptable accuracy, with
    a mean bias error (MBE) of 0.48 mm/day. Sensitivity analyses indicated that ETc
    models were most sensitive to the slope of the linear regression between Kcb and
    VIs, followed by soil evaporation constant and influential factor in Ks_DACT.
    From this study, the combinations of vegetation index and CWSI, as well as DACT,
    were recommended as alternative approaches for estimating ETc due to intrinsic
    simplicity and easy interpretation. These ETc models relying on UAV-based multi-sensor
    data thus show promising potential in farmland-scale applications.

    rapidly in irrigated agriculture due to population growth and an increase in food
    demand by 2050 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012, Elliott et al., 2014; Molden,
    2007; Ray et al., 2013). In semi-arid and arid areas, the use of deficit irrigation
    has been proposed to alleviate water scarcity and improve yields (Ali et al.,
    2007; Farre et al., 2009; Fereres et al., 2007; Tari et al., 2016). A key aspect
    for deficit irrigation relies on precise information about crop water requirements,
    including timely and accurate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimation (Helman
    et al., 2019). Conventionally, ETc can be monitored using in-situ measurements,
    such as weighing lysimeters (Lopez-Urrea et al., 2012), eddy covariance systems
    (Liu et al., 2013), and large aperture scintillometers (Hemakumara et al., 2003).
    However, such methods are not suitable for large-scale estimates of ETc due to
    their substantial expense and land surface heterogeneity. A practical and commonly
    accepted indirect approach, the FAO-56 method, estimates ETc by multiplying the
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by a crop coefficient (Kc) (Allen et al., 1998).
    Kc represents characteristics of a specific crop with respect to canopy properties,
    ground cover, and aerodynamic resistance; however, in-situ measurement of it still
    cannot describe the spatial variation of ETc within a farm. (Anderson et al.,
    2017, Er-Raki et al., 2007, Glenn et al., 2011, Katerji and Rana, 2006, Testi
    et al., 2004, Pereira et al., 2015). Significant advances in remote sensing technology
    have provided temporally and spatially distributed information regarding crops.
    Combining remote sensing-based data with the FAO-56 method makes it possible to
    monitor large-scale ETc in support of irrigation management. Relevant studies
    have been conducted over the past two decades (Bausch, 1995, Calera Belmonte et
    al., 2003, Campos et al., 2010, Campos et al., 2017, Choudhury et al., 1994; Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2013; Pôças et al., 2015). Furthermore, numerous other studies have investigated
    approaches using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs) for ETc prediction of
    annual crops in a simple, robust, and operational manner(Campos et al., 2010,
    Campos et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2017a, Jin et al., 2017b; Mateos et al., 2013).
    Nevertheless, satellite data cannot obtain timely crop growth information during
    the entire growing season, and cannot describe the detailed variation of ETc at
    the farmland scale due to low resolution and variable weather conditions (Wan
    et al., 2020). Recent developments in the miniaturization of sensors and energy
    storage technology have led to the current explosion in the applications of Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for data acquisition for precision agriculture because of
    their high spatio-temporal resolution compared with satellite platforms (Colomina
    and Molina, 2014, Hill et al., 2017, Sidike et al., 2018). The UAV imagery-based
    multispectral VIs have exhibited a relatively high prediction accuracy with regard
    to estimating Kc at farmland scale. Shao et al. (2021) utilized different types
    of VIs extracted from UAV-based multispectral imagery to monitor maize Kc during
    an entire growing season. UAV-based systems have the advantage of rapidly mapping
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a significant relationship
    between NDVI and the Kc in maize (Zea mays L.) was observed over the entire growing
    season (Zhang et al., 2019). The combined use of VIs derived from UAV-based multispectral
    images was also applied to predict ETc with the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach
    in maize (Tang et al., 2019), but the prediction accuracy was low with the root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 0.95 mm/day. Various studies demonstrated that appropriate
    VIs (NDVI, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and enhanced vegetation index
    (EVI)) can be used to efficiently monitor Kc compared with traditional measurements
    (Pôças et al., 2020). However, the application of VIs for the prediction of actual
    Kc values is not successful. The main problem is that most of the commonly used
    VIs represent the effects of potential growth reduction, but often lose sensitivity
    to water stress when its effect is only noticeable on the transpiration rates
    (Pôças et al., 2020). Due to the relationship between vegetation surface temperature
    and transpiration, thermal-based methods are highly suited for the detection of
    water stress status (Han et al., 2016, Pereira et al., 2015; Pôças et al., 2020;
    Veysi et al., 2017). Kullberg et al. (2017) compared several indices, including
    the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tcratio), Degrees
    Above Non-Stressed (DANS), and Degrees Above Canopy Threshold (DACT), based on
    canopy temperature for assessing the crop water stress coefficient (Ks) and resulting
    ETc using the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach. Olivera-Guerra et al. (2020)
    developed a new irrigation retrieval method at the Landsat pixel-scale based on
    optical and thermal data and the Ks derived from land surface temperature data.
    Currently, the use of satellite coincident optical and thermal data is still hampered
    by the lack of fine spatial and temporal resolutions at the farmland scale (Wulder
    et al., 2019). In addition, UAV-based thermal imagery has been applied for crop
    water status detection (Martinez et al., 2017; Santesteban et al., 2017; Zhang
    et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019), but has not been tested to estimate ETc from
    thermal-based Ks. As stated above, Ks can be quantified by crop canopy temperature.
    Therefore, it is necessary to investigate which simple method is better for assessing
    Ks and ETc around solar noon on sunny days on a farmland scale. In addition, the
    great potential of using combined data from multiple sensors to detect Ks and
    improve ETc assessment has not been well studied using UAVs. Here, we utilized
    UAV-based VIs and crop canopy temperature products to conduct a two-year study
    over a maize farm. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) investigate
    the potential of low-cost UAV-based imagery for maize ETc estimation; (2) compare
    the accuracy of each method to predict daily ETc, through a combination of three
    methods (NDVI, SAVI, and EVI) to determine basal crop coefficient (Kcb) and two
    different forms (CWSI and DACT) of Ks methods; and (3) evaluate the robustness
    and adaptability of UAV-based ETc estimation model across different irrigation
    treatments. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field experimental design A two-year
    field experiment was conducted on a 1.13 ha farm field situated in Zhaojun Town
    in the southwest region of Inner Mongolia, China (40°26''0.29\"N, 109°36''25.99\"E).
    The climate is semi-arid and the soil type is loamy sand. A more detailed description
    of the site is provided by Zhang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019, Zhang et al.,
    2019. The field was irrigated with a center pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries,
    Inc., Nebraska, USA) (Fig. 1). Maize (cv. ‘Junkai 918′) was planted in mid-May,
    tasseled in July, and harvested for silage in September 2018 and 2019. Inter-row
    spacing was 0.58 m and row direction was east-west. To avoid plant nutrient stress
    and weeds, fertilizer and herbicide were applied according to local farmer practices.

    indicate five treatment (TR) region divisions. Red dots are time domain reflectometry
    (TDR). In both years of the experiment, there were five treatments and five levels
    of irrigation. Each of the treatments was replicated three times with an individual
    plot size of 6 × 6 m. Treatment 1 was applied irrigation to fully satisfy crop
    water requirements during the whole growing season. In 2018, due to frequent rainfall
    during the entire growing season, deficit irrigation treatments were only applied
    during the rapid and middle growth stages. In 2019, the deficit irrigation treatments
    were applied during the entire growing season. Around 90 % of field water holding
    capacity was the benchmark of abundant irrigation. The amount of irrigation (Table
    1) in each treatment was measured by rain gauge cylinders with three replications.
    Meteorological data were obtained from a weather station located on a 1-ha alfalfa
    plot adjacent to the research field. The time courses of precipitation and maximum
    air temperature during the maize growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are shown in
    Fig. 2. The total precipitation in the period was 272 mm and 113 mm in 2018 and
    2019, respectively. The daily maximum air temperature ranged between 20 and 36 °C
    in both years. Table 1. Irrigation water amounts applied (mm) during the early,

    lines are the average temperature in 2018 and 2019, respectively. DAS represents
    the day after sowing. 2.2. Data acquisition 2.2.1. UAV-based data collection Two
    UAVs were used to capture images between 11:00 and 14:00 local time over the entire
    maize growing season in 2018 and 2019. The interval between flights was 10–20 min.
    The date of UAV data collection and weather conditions were shown in Table 2.
    The DJI Phantom 4 Pro (DJI, Shenzhen, China) obtained nadir (camera lens downward
    vertically) RGB images by flying at an altitude of 50 m above ground level (AGL).
    The instrument’s field of view was 84° and there were 90 % front and side image
    overlaps. With these specifications, the spatial resolution was 1.25 cm. A six-rotor
    unmanned aircraft DJI S900 (DJI, Shenzhen, China) platform was developed to carry
    multispectral and thermal cameras (Fig. 3). The payload lift capability was 2 kg.
    The multispectral camera, MicaSense RedEdge (RedEdge, MicaSense, Inc., Seattle,
    WA, USA) with a 5.5 mm focal lens, includes 5 bands (Blue, Green, Red, Near IR,
    and Red Edge) and produces 1280 × 960 pixels multispectral images. The FLIR Vue
    Pro R 640 thermal imager (640 ×412 pixels, 13 mm lens, and 9 Hz frequency) with
    a spectrum range of 7.5–13.0 µm was used to record the thermal imagery. A Pixhawk
    autopilot (CUAV, Guangzhou, China) was used as a flight control system and allowed
    for waypoint operations. The UAV flight path of the DJI S900 was planned using
    Mission Planner ground control station software (ArduPilot). The flight heights
    were set at 60 and 70 m AGL for thermal and multispectral images, respectively,
    and the flight path resulted in 85 % front and side overlap, providing ground
    sampling distances of 7 cm and 4.77 cm, respectively. The surface temperature
    was measured with a handheld infrared thermometer (RAYTEK ST60 +) over black and
    white diffuse boards (Group VIII, Provo, Utah, USA) and water during the UAV flight.
    More detailed calibration information for the UAV-based thermal imagery is provided
    in Zhang et al. (2019). Table 2. The date of data collection. DAS: day after sowing;

    DJI S900 Octocopter platform (a), MicaSense RedEdge sensor (b), and FLIR Vue Pro
    sensor (c). To optimize the geo-referencing of the images acquired from the multi-sensor
    UAV, five ground control points (GCPs) were positioned throughout the field. The
    precise centroid coordinates of the GCP targets were obtained with a KOLIDA RTK
    differential GNSS device (KOLIDA Instrument Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China). 2.2.2.
    Field data collection Field measurements obtained after the UAV flights include
    soil water content, canopy height, and leaf area index. Volumetric water contents
    at depths of 30, 60, and 90 cm in the soil profile were measured by using the
    traditional gravimetric method with three measurements in each plot. The dates
    of in-situ soil moisture observations were shown in Table 2. Each time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR) (TDR-315 L, Acclima, Meridian, Idaho, USA) was used to record
    volumetric soil water content every 30 min at depths of 30, 60, and 90 cm in each
    irrigation treatment. Plant heights (h) were manually measured using a measuring
    tape, with three readings in each plot. LAI was measured at the same observation
    points for plant height using an LAI-2200 plant canopy analyzer (LI-COR, Lincoln,
    NE, USA) on the corresponding flight days. 2.2.3. Image processing The Pix4Dmapper
    software (Pix4DInc., Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to mosaic and orthorectify
    the UAV RGB, multispectral, and thermal images. The multispectral images were
    calibrated using MicaSense calibrated reflectance panels (MicaSense, Seattle,
    WA, USA) during the flight. The raw multispectral image digital numbers were later
    converted to reflectance values. During post-processing, thermal images adjusted
    parameters to environmental conditions, such as air temperature and humidity,
    to conduct radiometric conversion. 2.3. Canopy spectral and thermal information
    extraction UAV-based VIs were extracted from the raw spectral bands (red, green,
    blue, near-infrared, and red-edge) and used as canopy spectral features. Additionally,
    three kinds of VIs, previously used to estimate Kcb, were calculated (Table 3).

    represent canopy temperature and canopy temperature threshold. Fractional vegetation
    cover (fc) and maize canopy temperature were estimated using the red-green ratio
    index (RGRI)-Otsu method (Zhang et al., 2019). The formulas for RGRI calculation
    are presented in Table 3. Additionally, fc, the percentage of vegetation area
    per ground surface area, was extracted from RGB imagery using the RGRI method.
    Classified maize pixels were divided by the total number of pixels in the plot
    to calculate fc. The maize pixels (value: 255) in the RGB images could be classified
    with the OTSU method. The classification image values were multiplied by the corresponding
    thermal infrared image values to extract the temperature of maize canopy (T).

    extraction of maize canopy. For the soil mask image, the pixel digital values
    of maize were 255, and the pixel values of soil were 0. Two water stress indices
    (CWSI and DACT) were used to calculate Ks. The formulas for CWSI and DACT calculations
    are presented in Table 3. The DACT was calculated using the canopy temperature
    and the canopy temperature threshold (Tcritical). Tcritical is a known constant
    for a given crop. For maize, 28 °C has been suggested by the ARS Plant Stress
    and Water Conservation Laboratory (Evett et al., 2000, DeJonge et al., 2015).
    The CWSI, where dTm, dTLL, and dTUL are the actual measurement, lower limit, and
    upper limit of the canopy-air temperature difference (Tc-Ta), respectively. CWSI
    can be simplified by taking 5 ºC as the constant dTUL (Cohen et al., 2015, DeJonge
    et al., 2015, Taghvaeian et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2022). In this study, dTLL
    has been established for 2018 and 2019 (Zhang et al., 2022) as shown in (1), (2),
    respectively. (1) (2) where VPD represents vapor pressure deficit. VPD (kPa) is
    related to air temperature and relative humidity, and could be calculated by the
    Eq. (3) (Walter et al., 2000): (3) where Ta represents air temperature (°C), and
    RH represents relative humidity (%). More details of the CWSI calculation can
    be found in Zhang et al. (2022). 2.4. Calculation of evapotranspiration and crop
    coefficient Daily ETc was estimated by the soil water balance equation: (4) where
    ETc,i is evapotranspiration for the day of interest (mm), iPi is precipitation
    for the day of interest (mm), Ii is irrigation for the day of interest (mm), Dr,i
    is deficit for the day of interest (mm), Dr,i-1 is deficit for the previous day
    of interest (mm), Dp,i is deep percolation for the day of interest (mm), ROi is
    surface runoff for the day of interest (mm), and CRi is the capillary rise from
    the deep water table for the day of interest (mm). Runoff and capillary rise were
    ignored due to no slope on the plot area and deep groundwater table. The Dp was
    calculated using the FAO-56 method (Allen et al., 1998). Following irrigation
    or heavy rain, SWC in the root zone might exceed field capacity and thus some
    of them may go down into deeper soil layers. It was assumed that the soil water
    content is at field capacity on the same day of the wetting event, so the Dr,i
    will be zero. ETc,i was estimated by the FAO-56 approach (Allen et al., 1998).
    (5) The basal crop coefficient Kcb and the crop water stress coefficient Ks were
    calculated using the FAO-56 procedures (Jensen and Allen, 2016). Under standard
    conditions (RHmin = 45 %, u2 = 2 m/s), the three key values (looking-up table
    in FAO-56) for the basal crop coefficient Kcb,tab of maize were determined as
    0.15 at the rapid, 1.15 at the middle, and 0.15 at the late growth stage, respectively.
    For calculating the daily actual value of Kcb, the standardized Kcb values are
    adjusted according to observed LAI and h values (Pereira et al., 2020). The modified
    FAO-56 Kcb value can be calculated by (6), (7): (6) (7) where Kcb,adjust is the
    Kcb corrected by meteorological factors; Kcb,tab is the value for Kcb under the
    above referred standard climate; h is the average plant height (m); u2 is the
    daily average wind speed at 2 m above the crop canopy (m/s); RHmin is the minimum
    relative humidity; when the crop dries in the field (Kcb ≤ 0.45), the adjustment
    by Eq. (6) is not required. Kcb, a indicates the Kcb modified by the LAI; Kc,min
    is the minimum value for bare soil (0.15); and k is the canopy attenuation coefficient
    of radiation, and the value of k is 0.7 by Ding et al. (2013). The crop water
    stress coefficient Ks can be expressed as a simple linear model following the
    procedures described in FAO-33 which is equal to the FAO-56 Ks procedure (Jensen
    and Allen, 2016). (8) (9) where θ is the mean volumetric soil water in the root
    zone (m3m−3); θt is the threshold water content (m3m−3); θwp is the permanent
    wilting point (m3m−3); θfc is the field capacity (m3m−3); p is the average fraction
    of available soil water that can be deleted from the root zone before moisture
    stress and is 0.55 for maize as previously recommended (Allen et al., 1998). Values
    for (8), (9) are listed in Table 4. Table 4. Soil characteristics and parameters

    (2013) 2.5. UAV-based ETc estimation methods based on the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient
    approach According to the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach, ETc is defined
    as follows: (10) where Ks is the soil water stress coefficient representing the
    influence of the soil water stress factor on crop transpiration; Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing the ratio of crop transpiration under no stress;
    Ke is the soil evaporation coefficient; ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.
    We evaluated two different forms of the Ks model in combination with three types
    of Kcb approaches. The two forms of the Ks model employed thermal information.
    First, CWSI was used to quantify Ks. According to Jackson et al. (1981), the first
    model was: (11) The second model employed DACT to calculate Ks. On the condition
    that DACT was 0 for no stress and positive infinity for high stress, the normalized
    relationship between Ks and DACT found in Kullberg et al. (2017) can be expressed
    as: (12) a is a variable optimized to reduce the RMSE between Ks determined from
    DACT. NDVI, SAVI, and EVI were used for the estimation of Kcb in this study. The
    linear function of the Kcb_VI approach can be given as: (13) Finally, we assumed
    constant rates of soil water evaporation and Ke values were related to fc according
    to Er Raki et al. (2007). Therefore, Ke values were derived as: (14) The value
    c was based on the frequency of irrigation and rainfall: from the early stage
    start until the NDVImax (DOY 161–202 in 2018 and DOY 159–207 in 2019) 13 and 7
    irrigation/rainfall events of > 0.2 *ET0 occurred (for relevant rainfall events,
    see Allen et al., 2006, p. 153). This was equivalent to rainfall events every
    3 days in 2018 and 7 days in 2019. With an average ET0 of 3.8 mm/day and 4.0 mm/day
    during the growing season, this corresponds to a coefficient of 0.8 in 2018 and
    0.3 in 2019. In order to analyze the effect a particular Kcb method may have on
    the accuracy of each Ks method, each stress coefficient was applied with each
    of VIs (NDVI, SAVI, and EVI) based Kcb values. ETc using all combinations of the
    two Ks methods and three Kcb methods were compared to ETc from the observed TDR
    and soil water balance measurements. Model performance was quantified by using
    the coefficient of determination (R2), RMSE, the mean bias error (MBE) and the
    relative root mean square error (RRMSE). The detailed workflow from feature extraction
    to model building and evaluation is presented in Fig. 5. There was a total of
    100 samples collected from 2018 to 2019, in which 70 samples selected randomly
    were the training set, and the remaining 30 samples were the validation set. For
    estimation models of the Ks, Kcb, and ETc, 70 % of the total samples in 2018 and
    2019 were used as the training set, and the remaining samples were used as the
    validation set. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download

    relative importance of the parameters in the ETc models, three parameters (a,
    b0, and c) were subjected to a sensitivity analysis. a is a key influential factor
    in Ks_DACT; b0 is slope of the linear regression between Kcb and VIs; c is soil
    evaporation constant applied in Ke calculation. In the analysis, the values of
    these parameters were increased or decreased by up to 50 % of their original values
    and the simulated and original ETc values were then compared to determine the
    influence of these parameters on the models. 3. Results 3.1. Validation of soil

    under different irrigation treatments Fig. 8 shows the effects of different levels
    of deficit irrigation on Kcb_FAO, Ks_FAO, and vegetation indices. As shown in
    Fig. 8A and B, Kcb_FAO gradually increased during the early stage, peaked at the
    middle stage, and decreased thereafter at the late stage. Compared with Kcb_FAO
    in 2018 (Fig. 8A), Kcb_FAO in 2019 (Fig. 8B) increased with increasing irrigation
    levels. For instance, the average of Kcb_FAO were 0.89, 0.85, and 0.79 for Tr
    6, 7, and 8, respectively. Compared with Ks_FAO in 2019 (Fig. 8C), Ks_FAO in 2018
    (Fig. 8D) was overall higher due to the large rainfall events occurring during
    the early to middle growth stage. Download : Download high-res image (628KB) Download

    is the boundary between the early and middle stages. The gray dashed line is the
    boundary between the middle and late stages. DAS represents the day after sowing.
    UAV VIs and thermal data were selected and conducted to investigate which parameters
    were sensitive to irrigation levels. As shown in Fig. 8C-J, the VIs increased
    gradually until the middle growth stage and then slightly decreased. Compared
    with SAVI and EVI, a significant saturation phenomenon was observed for NDVI at
    the late growth stage. The VIs in 2018 showed no obvious differences among the
    five irrigation levels during the entire growing season, while the VIs in 2019
    increased with increasing irrigation levels. The results indicate that NDVI, SAVI,
    and EVI are suitable for monitoring Kcb during entire growing season. Additionally,
    the changing pattern of canopy temperature (T) contrasts with the changes of Ks_FAO
    (e.g. the average of T were 26.8 and 32.8 for Tr 1 and 4, while the average of
    Ks_FAO were 0.95 and 0.87), indicating that T can be used to monitor Ks_FAO and
    is closely related to irrigation level during the entire growing season (Fig.
    8K and L). 3.3. Results of Ks and Kcb estimation To convert CWSI and DACT into
    Ks, the relationships between Ks_FAO values and two indices are shown in Fig.
    9A and B. Moreover, the relationships between Kcb_FAO and the three VIs are shown

    as shown by scatterplots (Fig. 10) that include bias measurements via best fit
    lines (assuming intercept of 0), R2, and RMSE for each method. Satisfactory results
    from the ETc assessment based on Ks_CWSI model were achieved using Kcb_NDVI, Kcb_SAVI,
    and Kcb_EVI methods, with slope, R2, and RMSE of 1.02, 0.84, and 0.50 mm/day,
    0.99, 0.83, and 0.50 mm/day, and 0.924, 0.751, and 0.663 mm/day, respectively
    (Fig. 10A-C). Fig. 10D-F show that Ks_DACT model also provided comparable estimates
    of ETc (NDVI: slope = 1.04, R2 = 0.80, and RMSE = 0.53 mm/day; SAVI: slope = 1.00,
    R2 = 0.77, and RMSE = 0.53 mm/day; EVI: slope = 1.01, R2 = 0.77, and RMSE = 0.53 mm/day).
    Both Ks_CWSI and Ks_DACT models had more scatters at higher ETc values. Download

    water balance. Ks methods include CWSI (A, B, C) and DACT (D, E, F), Kcb methods
    include NDVI (A, D), SAVI (B, E), and EVI (C, F). Compared with the daily ETc
    values from the TDR soil water balance, RMSE values for each combination of Ks
    and Kcb method in 2018 and 2019 are shown in Table 6. For both Ks methods in 2018,
    the Kcb_SAVI method provided the best prediction accuracy with an average RMSE
    of 0.49 mm/day, while using EVI resulted in greater errors compared with other
    VIs (an average of 0.59 mm/day). In 2018, the two Ks methods performed at similar
    levels of accuracy. The two Ks methods performed at different levels of accuracy,
    and the lower RMSE of CWSI compared with DACT in 2019 indicates that CWSI has
    more potential to be used as a stress coefficient under stressed conditions. EVI
    exhibited the poorest performance in 2019 with an average RMSE of 0.67 mm/day.

    image data for assessment of ETc was confirmed, the influence of different irrigation
    levels on the performance of ETc prediction is still unclear. Fig. 11A shows the
    prediction results under different irrigation levels. The RMSE of using Ks_DACT
    was slightly increased for the more stressed treatments in 2019 (an average of
    0.81 mm/day). The Ks_CWSI model performed well at all treatments (an average of
    0.48 mm/day). Compared with the RMSE values for the two methods in the less stressed
    treatments, the Ks_DACT model exhibited a relatively poorer prediction result
    than the Ks_CWSI in more stressed treatments. Download : Download high-res image

    the study period. All combinations of Ks and Kcb methods overestimated ETc. Moreover,
    the two Ks methods performed at similar levels of accuracy, and the low MBE values
    with Ks_DACT and Ks_CWSI models indicate that these indices have the potential
    to be used to estimate cumulative water use. 3.5. Sensitivity analysis of the
    ETc models Fig. 12 shows the sensitivity analysis of different ETc models toward
    changing parameters a, b0 and c. No sensitivity analysis was done for parameter
    a in Ks_CWSI model as it was estimated independently as a function of VPD. Different
    ETc models exhibited similar behaviors with changing parameters. The sensitivity
    analysis reveals that the decreasing of 50 % of parameters a and c resulted in
    a reduction of 9 % and 18 % in 2018 ETc, respectively, and a reduction of 21 %
    and 10 % in 2019 ETc, respectively, regardless of ETc models. In 2018, when the
    value of parameter b0 was reduced by 50 %, both Ks-based ETc decreased by 33 %,
    35 %, and 24 % for Kcb_NDVI, Kcb_SAVI, and Kcb_EVI models, respectively. In 2019,
    when the value of parameter b0 was reduced by 50 %, both Ks-based ETc decreased
    by 40 %, 43 %, and 32 % for Kcb_NDVI, Kcb_SAVI, and Kcb_EVI models, respectively.
    In general, ETc models were most sensitive to parameter b0 in both years, indicating
    that the major differences in these models are their different descriptions of
    the Kcb. Additionally, the importance of water stress in ETc models was higher
    than soil evaporation under water deficit conditions (Fig. 12D vs. F). Download

    Discussion The spectral information used to calculate VIs from remote sensing
    data has shown potential for ETc prediction, but the reliability and the accuracy
    of these predictions have not been satisfactory under water stress condition (Pocas
    et al., 2020, Tang et al., 2019). For instance, Tang et al. (2019) reported that
    VIs-based ETc prediction model produced low accuracy with RMSE of 0.95–1.25 mm/day
    under different levels of deficit irrigation. This is mainly due to three problems:
    (1) the VIs easily saturate under high biomass conditions (Thenkabail et al.,
    2000, Fu et al., 2014); (2) most commonly used VIs are not responsive to early
    stages of crop water stress (Campos et al., 2013, Pocas et al., 2015); and (3)
    the developed ETc prediction models are not robust enough to assess the ETc of
    contrasting climate years (Pereira et al., 2020, Pocas et al., 2020). In this
    study, we proposed the integration of optical and thermal information to overcome
    the VI-saturation issue, extraction of a thermal-based water stress indicator,
    and development of a prediction model to improve the robustness of response to
    climate change. 4.1. Relationship between UAV-based VIs and Kcb/Ks Remote sensing-based
    VIs have been employed to assess Kcb and irrigation requirements (Campos et al.,
    2010, Campos et al., 2017; Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013; Mateos et al., 2013; Padilla
    et al., 2011), but it has been unclear whether UAV-based image data could monitor
    crop growth to forecast crop coefficients in different years. As shown in Fig.
    8, both Kcb_FAO and UAV-based image data provided time course plots of maize under
    different water applications. UAV-based VIs data were not sensitive to the slight
    water stress condition especially at the middle and late growth stage due to the
    saturation at high canopy coverage, and the results are consistent with previous
    studies (Becker-Reshef et al., 2010; Vergara-Diaz et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2020;
    Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). In the performance of each Kcb estimate method, we
    found that the correlations between Kcb with NDVI, SAVI and EVI were robust regardless
    of growing season and irrigation treatment with RMSE ranging from 0.07 to 0.12
    (Fig. 13A). In this study, the temperature changes showed an opposite trend to
    Ks_FAO, suggesting that temperature could monitor maize water status. Moreover,
    the close linkages between thermal-based temperature and water stress coefficients
    have been shown in many previous studies (Colaizzi et al., 2003, Kullberg et al.,
    2017, Olivera-Guerra et al., 2020). However, the correlation between Ks and DACT
    were more susceptible to climate factors and irrigation treatments in the performance
    of each Ks estimate method especially under water stress conditions (Fig. 13B).
    This indicated that the normalization equations or methodology of Ks_DACT may
    need to be calibrated by applying more severe stressed treatments and different
    climactic conditions. Download : Download high-res image (135KB) Download : Download

    for each treatment (A); and daily Ks estimate RMSE for each stress index method
    for each treatment (B). UAV-based optical and thermal remote sensing can provide
    a more comprehensive description of maize growth by combining different image
    parameters. Most importantly, UAV-based optical and thermal remote sensing could
    generate high-resolution diagnostic ETc maps at different growth stages to support
    precision field management and decision-making. 4.2. Performance of regression
    methods in maize ETc prediction Previous studies have demonstrated that spectral-based
    indicators (VIs) and thermal-based indicators (CWSI and DACT) extracted from remote
    sensing images were linked to ETc (Mahmoud and Gan, 2019, Mokhtari et al., 2018,
    Olivera-Guerra et al., 2020, Pocas et al., 2020). Our study proved that NDVI,
    SAVI, EVI, CWSI, and DACT from UAV images could provide good characterizations
    of maize evapotranspiration, but they provided different prediction results. Regarding
    Kcb regression methods, Kcb_NDVI and Kcb_SAVI methods generally exhibited very
    close performance in both Ks methods (CWSI and DACT) for the two different years
    (Table 6). Kcb_NDVI model performed slightly better in each Ks based ETc prediction
    in 2019, while Kcb_SAVI model performed better in 2018. However, EVI performed
    slightly worse than the other two methods in both 2018 and 2019, regardless of
    thermal-based indicators (Table 6). This result agrees with previous studies (Pereira
    et al., 2015, Shao et al., 2021) that NDVI and SAVI were superior to EVI in maize
    ETc estimation applications because of the actual vegetation cover conditions
    reflected by these indices. Additionally, relatively lower RMSE values were achieved
    for Ks_CWSI regression in combination with three Kcb methods, compared with the
    Ks_DACT method (Table 6). This is likely attributable to the fact that CWSI obtained
    from in-situ data produced more accurate values than DACT for the prediction of
    crop water stress (Taghvaeian et al., 2014, DeJonge et al., 2015). The best performance
    for ETc prediction was the Ks_CWSI method combined with Kcb_NDVI, achieving an
    R2 of 0.84 and RMSE of 0.50 mm/day (Fig. 10A). Furthermore, compared with CWSI,
    DACT more consistently overestimated ETc on days with higher ETc values. One reason
    could be that DACT underestimated water stress status, and the normalization equation
    used in this study for maize still might not be adequate, as found in previous
    studies regarding optimal empirical values and stress levels (DeJonge et al.,
    2015, Kullberg et al., 2017). The different irrigation levels produced distinct
    maize canopy characteristics, resulting in different spatial and spectral features
    in the UAV-based images. Consequently, the prediction accuracy of ETc would vary
    with irrigation levels, and the mild-stressed irrigation treatments in both years
    exhibited better performance regardless of the Ks methods (Fig. 11A). In addition,
    all treatments produced slightly higher errors from the Ks_DACT model in 2019.
    The reason why the prediction accuracy decreased may be also related to the impact
    of soil evaporation. Soil evaporation is low under water stress conditions, and
    constant evaporation rates cannot reflect the role of soil evaporation, especially
    at early growth stages. Furthermore, the daily MBE values for ETc prediction over
    2018 and 2019 from the Ks_CWSI model and the Ks_DACT model combined with the Kcb_VI
    methods were similar (Fig. 11B). This result agrees with previous studies (Kullberg
    et al., 2017) that DACT had the same performance as CWSI in predicting cumulative
    ETc. Consequently, we concluded that the proposed models were robust in predicting
    ETc between different years. 4.3. Uncertainty and future works Under the current
    framework, the ETc models have the potential to improve irrigation scheduling
    by precisely managing crop stress and water supply. However, it still has some
    weaknesses that should be noted. The ETc calculation was based on the FAO-56 dual
    crop coefficient approach. Although the model validation was satisfactory, there
    still exist fitting parameters (a, b0, and c) in the model that need calibration,
    as the parameters may differ in crop type, irrigation management, and climatic
    conditions (Pocas et al., 2020). The water stress was calculated using stress
    index equations. Further work is suggested to investigate other stress indices
    for Ks evaluation without local calibration, which may reduce limitations in practical
    applications. The soil evaporation parameter c was set to be a constant value
    with the frequency of irrigation and rainfall. Further soil evaporation models
    can be developed to use UAV synthetic aperture radar data for estimating Ke under
    partial and full cover conditions. Moreover, the use of weighing lysimeters to
    validate daily ETc values increases the reliability of these results. For the
    maize ETc estimation models generated in the study, the effects of irrigation
    amount and sensitivity of parameters were analyzed over two years. Future work
    is needed to test the performance of ETc models in other climatological conditions
    to determine the applicability and transferability of these methods. 5. Conclusions
    The ability of optical and thermal information derived from multiple UAV-based
    sensors to monitor crop ETc under different levels of deficit irrigation was evaluated
    using VIs and temperature-based water stress indices. We found that UAV-based
    canopy temperature measurements were suitable for monitoring crop water status
    as well as Ks during the entire maize growing season. Two types of stress coefficient
    models, based on (1) CWSI and (2) DACT, were evaluated and found to provid the
    best results for crop ETc assessment in combination with Kcb_VI approaches in
    2018 and 2019 (R2 of 0.84 and 0.80; RMSE of 0.50 mm/day and 0.53 mm/day, respectively).
    Compared with NDVI and SAVI, the empirical Kcb_EVI model showed a relatively poorer
    prediction result. Although results varied with irrigation levels, daily MBE values
    of ETc prediction indicated that the proposed methods performed robustly over
    different years. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the parameters
    in ETc models, and the models were highly sensitive to the slope of the linear
    regression between Kcb and VIs, followed by soil evaporation constant and influential
    factor in Ks_DACT. The developed approach for estimating maize ETc at the field
    scale with high spatial-temporal resolution can improve irrigation management
    with precision agriculture. Future work is needed to investigate the combined
    use of ancillary models (radar-based models and soil water balance models) to
    retrieve soil evaporation values to further increase the accuracy of ETc estimation.

  limitations: It is important to note that the developed approach for estimating
    maize ETc at the field scale with high spatial-temporal resolution can improve
    irrigation management with precision agriculture. Future work is needed to investigate
    the combined use of ancillary models (radar-based models and soil water balance
    models) to retrieve soil evaporation values to further increase the accuracy of
    ETc estimation.

- analysis: 'The paper titled "A Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor" develops
    and evaluates an innovative irrigation system called the Hydraulic Evapotranspiration
    Multisensor (HEM), which uses evaporation rates to control irrigation frequency
    and duration.


    The paper describes the HEM system, which comprises an evaporation pan, floater,
    magnetic valve, and water return mechanism. It explains how the system operates
    based on the natural process of evaporation and the magnetic valve''s response
    to water level changes.


    The relevance of the paper to the point of "Considerations: volume, frequency,
    format, and source of the data" within the context of "data collection to cloud:
    automation and real-time processing" is established in the following ways:


    * **Relevance 1:** The HEM system''s primary purpose is to monitor evaporation
    rates, which are directly related to the volume of water required for irrigation.
    By monitoring evaporation, the system can adjust irrigation frequency and duration
    to ensure optimal water usage.


    * **Relevance 2:** The frequency and duration of irrigation cycles are controlled
    by the HEM system based on real-time measurements of evaporation rates. This automated
    process eliminates the need for manual adjustments and ensures that irrigation
    is always aligned with the actual water requirements of the crops.


    * **Relevance 3:** The data used by the HEM system is collected through the evaporation
    pan, which represents the actual water loss due to evaporation. This direct and
    real-time measurement of water loss provides a highly accurate basis for determining
    irrigation needs.


    * **Relevance 4:** The HEM system operates independently without any external
    data sources or connectivity. It relies solely on the observed evaporation rates
    within the evaporation pan, making data collection and processing entirely self-contained.'

    Keywords: irrigation scheduling; patent; sensor; microclimate 1. Introduction
    Maybe one of the most important factors for crop growth and sustainable water
    management is the determination of the right amount and frequency of an irrigation
    event (i.e., irrigation scheduling). Traditionally, irrigation scheduling was
    based on growers’ perspective rather than on specific microclimatic conditions,
    plant indicators (i.e., crop temperature), or soil properties, resulting many
    times in suboptimal growing conditions and a percentage of water and nutrient
    amount outflow to the environment [1]. Indeed, several methods have been used
    to calculate the optimum water volume of irrigation water, delivered at appropriate
    intervals to the various plantations, for the different growing stages for open
    field crops and within greenhouses [2,3]. However, in all methods evapotranspiration
    (ETC) is the most important factor used for calculating optimum irrigation scheduling
    [4]. This is the combined water amount consumed through the transpiration (T)
    of the plants and the evaporation (E) from the wet soil. Models and methods of
    predicting soil–plant–atmosphere water transfers may be helpful for better management
    of water inputs to crops [5]. One of the most widely used systems for climatic
    measurements, in order to determine evaporation, is the Class A Evaporation Pan
    (i.e., 121 cm diameter) [6]. It has been used for estimating the amount of evapotranspiration
    in irrigation on a daily basis or even longer periods, for open field and greenhouse
    cultivations. The simplicity and high degree of adaptation on farm’s levels, which
    are characteristic of the Evaporation Pan, seem to be the primary reason for the
    pan expansion between producers; even though within greenhouses smaller pans or
    atmometers are preferable, as they occupy less space [6,7]. As ETC depends on
    weather conditions (temperature, wind velocity, relative humidity, sunshine),
    as exactly happens with the evaporation rates of water from a free surface, the
    easiest method to calculate ETC is to use readings obtained from an Evaporation
    Pan, relate them with a pilot plantation and apply certain factors for each particular
    plantation [8]. Based on this knowledge and considering the dependence of these
    two natural processes, namely transpiration in plants and water evaporation from
    a free surface, on the same weather constituents, the idea of controlling irrigation
    by monitoring evaporation, described in the “Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor,
    HEM”, is considered a promising irrigation system to produce. HEM operates as
    the controlling component of automatic irrigation systems, responding to weather
    changes by adjusting the time interval between consecutive irrigation cycles,
    set on installation for average weather, as the normal, for certain plantation
    and soil texture. The adjustments are automatically carried out by the Evapotranspiration
    Multisensor, for the purpose to save water at times of low evapotranspiration
    rate, but also to avoid water deficit stress in weather conditions imposing increased
    evapotranspiration rate. HEM senses the changes of the weather constituents (rainfall,
    temperature, humidity, wind velocity, sunshine) in a holistic way, thus more efficiently.
    The Hydraulic version is applicable where pressurized irrigation systems, i.e.,
    drip or sprinkler irrigation are practiced no matter whether electric power is
    available or not. It is relevant to the work of [9] who proposed a prototype consisting
    of a mini-pan and probes, especially designed for greenhouse cropping conditions,
    for automatically governed irrigation in accordance with a water level. However,
    till today, despite that many sensors and technologies are available for monitoring
    the water level within a pan, they are still not compatible with the available
    irrigation automation [10]. “Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor” (HΕΜ) irrigation
    controller, which is an upgrade of the said “Automatic Irrigation Regulator Controlled
    by Water Evaporation”, is a novel product, because no similar Irrigation controller
    operating only from the energy obtained from piped water, that takes into account
    all weather parameters in a holistic way by monitoring water evaporation in an
    Evaporation Pan has yet been produced. Knowledge of automatic mechanical irrigation
    controllers originates from patents: “United States Patent, Kypris, Patent No
    4,967,789, date of patent Nov. 6, 1990” with the title “Automatic Irrigation Regulator
    Controlled by Water Evaporation”, the “Numero de publication internationale WO
    2006/058976 A1”. Date of Publication 08.06.2006, inventor: Ballet, Bernard, under
    the title “Stand Alone Mechanical Devices for Controlled Watering ” and the “Cyprus
    Patent No CY2620, Dedalos Kypris, 24 April 2019”, under the title Evapotranspiration
    Multisensor. The general objectives of the production of a novel Hydraulic Evapotranspiration
    Multisensor, naturally adjusting to weather changes, is to provide optimum irrigation
    to plantations and also save water, to operate at remote places without electric
    power, but driven only from the pressure of piped water, controlled by the natural
    process of evaporation. 2. Materials and Methods Product Design and Operation
    Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor (HEM) is illustrated in Figure 1. It
    consists of a nonmagnetic Evaporation Pan (1), containing water, the pan bearing
    a nonmagnetic Base Pipe (2) tightly fixed at its base so that when the Pan is
    in position, the Pipe is vertical. A cylindrical Floater (3) with a tubular opening
    along its axis, housing a permanent Ring Magnet (4) floats in Evaporation Pan’s
    water, sliding on Base Pipe that enters said tubular opening. Within the Base
    Pipe, the tubular nonmagnetic Stem (5) of a Hydraulic Magnetic Valve is inserted.
    Below the Evaporation Pan is the nonmagnetic Body (6) of the Valve. This has two
    openings, the upper one as Inlet (7), and the lower one as Outlet (8). The two
    are connected through a small diameter Nozzle (9) closing by the weight of a Magnetic
    Rod (10), freely moving up and down in said Stem. The Inlet (7) connects through
    a small pipe (11) with the membrane Chamber (12) of a Transformed solenoid Water
    valve, that HEM controls (or to a Hydraulic Watervalve), conveying the hydraulic
    signals. When the Nozzle is closed the “pressure” signal is transmitted to the
    water valve to stop irrigation, when open the “no pressure” signal is transmitted
    to start irrigation. The Outlet connects to the irrigation line, with a similar
    pipe (13), either directly, or via the transformed water valve through the Adaptor
    (14), that replaced said solenoid. Said Rod consists of a nonmagnetic Stick (10)
    with a Rubber Pad (15) at the lower end, to close the Nozzle and a Magnetic Element
    (16) at its upper end. This Magnetic Element is attracted by the Ring Magnet (4)
    to open the Nozzle. The under-pressure water escapes through the Nozzle to the
    irrigation line, effecting a pressure drop in the Chamber (12), that opens the
    water valve. This happens when the water level in Evaporation Pan, due to evaporation,
    drops, down to a predetermined point, where the downward movement of the Floater
    with the Magnet is stopped by a Ring Screw (17) at the lower part of the Base
    Pipe. During irrigation water returns through a Return Pipe (18) and an Adjustable
    Dripper (19) to the Evaporation Pan, to replace what was lost by evaporation.
    The rate of Returned water defines irrigation time. The Returned water gradually
    raises the water level in the Evaporation Pan, and the Floater with the Magnet
    follows dragging upward the Rod until this is stopped by the Frequency Screw (20).
    This is placed, watertight, at the upper end of said Stem (5) to change, at will
    by turning, the route length that Rod is allowed to go, before being stopped by
    the Screw and falling down to close said Nozzle. The allowed route defines the
    irrigation frequency, which depends on the column of the water to be evaporated
    at each irrigation cycle. Said Frequency screw is graduated (21) in mm for setting
    the expected water level drop in the Pan on an average hot day as the normal,
    for the frequency-time between consecutive irrigation cycles we wish. The actual
    frequency depends on weather conditions. Figure 1. Drawing details of a Hydraulic
    Evapotranspiration Multisensor. The technical knowledge, after which the product
    HEM is based, is here explained. A magnetic hydraulic valve is actuated by a permanent
    magnet to open, when the magnet is brought near the magnetic component of the
    valve, while this is closed when the magnet is removed, with no electricity involved.
    An evaporation pan contains water, left to evaporate, while a floater bearing
    said permanent magnet floats in the water, following the dropping water level,
    at the rate imposed by the weather conditions. When the magnet approaches the
    magnetic component of the magnetic hydraulic valve, which is fixed at the bottom
    of the pan, turns it open. So water is released for irrigation while at the same
    time some water from the outlet of the magnetic hydraulic valve returns to the
    Evaporation Pan to replace what was lost by evaporation, raising the magnet away
    from the said valve to terminate irrigation. The rate of water evaporation determines
    the time between two consecutive irrigation cycles. Frequency is then automatically
    adjusted as weather conditions change. Irrigation time depends on the water return
    rate replacing what was lost by evaporation and is controlled by an adjustable
    dripper. HEM is suitable to control pressurized irrigation systems such as drip
    and sprinklers. For the purpose of avoiding the preparation of complicated expensive
    molds, we proceed with simple, not costly, modifications, mainly on selected hydraulic
    valves of various types and sizes and Evaporation Pans. To test the suitability
    of the modified said existing components selected, a complete HEM system was prepared
    (Figure 2). The rest of the components were manufactured in a workshop from plastic
    or metal, to assemble several prototypes. Performance tests carried out at first
    in the laboratory, in relation to operational pressures, permanent magnet attraction
    force in relation to said Rod’s magnetic component, Return water methods and materials,
    and carry out pressure drop measurements. The fittings for adjustments, relating
    to irrigation frequencies and water return rate, relating to irrigation time,
    were tested and modified to be easily adjusted by the farmers. Figure 2. A Hydraulic
    Evapotranspiration Multisensor (A) and different components (B,C). The HEM device
    was then preliminary tested under high evaporation rates (summer period), in an
    open field side (Figure 3), in an inland semi-arid location of southern Cyprus
    (lat. 35°8′8.7 N, long. 33°24′9.6 E, altitude 165 m, m.s.l). Preliminary results
    will be used in order to re-adjusting the HEM components and increased the instrument
    sensitivity for monitoring lower within the greenhouse evapotranspiration rates.
    As regards water evaporation rates, for the average weather conditions in Cyprus
    (a semi-arid Mediterranean country), evaporation in summer time is about 270 mm
    per month (9 mm/d) and in winter about 70 mm per month (2.3 mm/d), while, for
    example, monthly water requirements of citrus plantations, or bananas, are for
    August 150 mm and 200 mm, for March 20 and 25 mm, respectively. Within greenhouses,
    the estimated evapotranspiration rates are estimated by 2–3 mm for cucumbers and
    tomatoes [1]. Figure 3. A Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor tested in the
    field, next to an agro-meteorology station. 3. Results and Discussion In irrigation
    technology all efforts have been devoted in the line of designing and producing
    electronic automated systems ranging from low-cost programmable timers to more
    expensive systems, monitoring ground moisture. Recently there is a trend in industries
    to move towards more sophisticated systems, which is to connect sensors, monitoring
    certain weather constituents (Figure 2). These are provided with a software to
    intervene and adjust the settings of the electronic timers, according to the readings
    of the sensors. Such systems are expensive, and difficult for an ordinary farmer
    to understand and manipulate. This HEM is easy to be installed and adjust by simple
    means, both the time interval between irrigation cycles and the duration of irrigation,
    which an ordinary farmer can do. The HEM product itself is an innovation because
    no stand-alone mechanical automatic irrigation system is yet available in the
    market. It has simple components, cooperating together in a way that is innovative.
    For instance, a floater bears a permanent magnet, which by following the dropping
    level of water in an Evaporation Pan acts on a special mechanism to start irrigation
    and following the rising water level in the same pan, because the water returns
    to replace what was lost by evaporation and acts on the same mechanism to stop
    irrigation. The mechanism is also an innovation, consisting of a vertical pipe
    within which a magnetic rod with a rubber pad is housed, free to move up and down
    when attracted by said magnet, having at the lower end fixtures to replace the
    solenoid of a common solenoid water valve, to perform as said valve without electricity.
    Certain facts are worth considering for HEM to be preferred instead of other sophisticated
    irrigation systems or traditional time clock scheduling such as: When plantations
    have increased water requirements, because of weather conditions, irrigation frequency
    is increased to satisfy the demand, protecting plantations from water deficit
    stress. During cold or rainy days or other weather conditions, when water demand
    is reduced, the time between consecutive irrigation cycles is increased for water
    saving. HEM operates without the need for electricity of any kind, very much suited
    for remote plantations. The automatic operation based on natural processes, allows
    the system to operate without the need to be attended to for a long time, if there
    is no need to adjust the water volume required due to the plantation’s stage of
    development, or other reasons. In case the water supply is cut during irrigation,
    the system waits until water returns back and continues to complete the irrigation
    cycle, supplying also what water is due because of evaporation at the time the
    system was idle. The flow rate of the return water to the Evaporation Pan, to
    replace what was lost by evaporation, being transferred from that released for
    irrigation, is affected as the yield of the irrigation installations from pressure
    changes. In case of reduced pressure, irrigation time is extended to cover the
    loss. Preliminary results proved that the HEM is quite robust to climatic changes;
    therefore, it could be used in precise irrigation control—matching the frequency
    of irrigation to the seasonal demands of the plants. Indeed, the mean daily potential
    evapotranspiration estimated considering climatic data of the area using the Penman–Monteith
    equation was about 6.5 mm for a representative week period in July (automatic
    agro-meteorological climatic station, MeteoSense 4.0, Netsens, Calenzano, Florence,
    Italy), which is very similar to the readings of the tested HEM (i.e., 7 mm d−1).
    Deviations are expected according to weather deviations from normal. The following
    table (Table 1) is for the dimensions of the tested HEM relates to the on-site
    adjustments, necessary for the system to deliver the correct volume of irrigation
    water. Table 1. Water return rate in the HEM pan (mL min−1). The performance operation
    evaluation of the HEM, allowed us further proceeded with the model modification
    for testing the applicability of the HEM within the greenhouse. Research is in
    progress in order to increase the instrument sensitivity to greenhouse climatic
    conditions (smaller reference evapotranspiration rates) related to the Evaporation
    Pan diameter. 4. Conclusions The Hydraulic Evapotranspiration Multisensor-HEM
    as described in this Technical Note was tested under field conditions and it was
    proved to be stable, accurate, and suitable as far as an irrigation water-saving
    device. With some adjustment needed in the field, considering the specific microclimatic,
    soil and related to crop growing conditions, HEM provides a smart stand-alone
    irrigation control system for crops grown under low-technology plastic Mediterranean
    greenhouses 5. Patents “United States Patent, Kypris, Patent No 4,967,789, date

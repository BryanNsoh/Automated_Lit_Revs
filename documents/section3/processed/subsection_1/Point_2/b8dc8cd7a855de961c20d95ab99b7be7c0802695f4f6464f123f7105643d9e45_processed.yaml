    next-generation networks (NGN), a very large number of devices and applications
    are emerged, along with the heterogeneity of technologies, architectures, mobile
    data, etc., and optimizing such a network is of utmost importance. Besides convex
    optimization and game theory, swarm intelligence (SI) has recently appeared as
    a promising optimization tool for wireless networks. As a new subdivision of artificial
    intelligence, SI is inspired by the collective behaviors of societies of biological
    species. In SI, simple agents with limited capabilities can achieve intelligent
    strategies for high-dimensional and challenging problems, and thus SI has recently
    found many applications in NGN. However, SI techniques have still not fully investigated
    in the literature, especially in the contexts of wireless networks. In this work,
    our primary focus will be the integration of these two domains, i.e., NGN and
    SI. Firstly, we provide an overview of SI techniques from fundamental concepts
    to well-known optimizers. Secondly, we review the applications of SI to settle
    emerging issues in NGN, including spectrum management and resource allocation,
    wireless caching and edge computing, network security, and several other miscellaneous
    issues. Finally, we highlight challenges and issues in the literature, and introduce
    some interesting directions for future research. Previous article in issue Next

    Four generations of cellular networks have been introduced since the inception
    of the first generation in the early 1980s. It is expected that massive numbers
    of connected devices, applications, technologies, network architecture, etc. will
    be available in next-generation communication networks (NGN, i.e., fifth-generation
    (5G) and sixth-generation (6G)) (Pham et al., 2020a). In 5G, three main use cases
    are enhanced mobile broadband, massive Internet of Things (IoT), and ultra-reliable
    and low latency communication. Besides the benefits offered by NGN, there are
    many challenges needed to be tackled to make it successful. For example, how to
    reduce the expenditure and operation complexity for network operators, and simultaneously
    support a large number of use cases and services from third-party companies. Many
    problems need to be studied in NGN such as power control and user clustering in
    non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) (Dai et al., 2018), task offloading and
    resource allocation in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems (Mao et al.,
    2017), network slicing in virtualized wireless networks (Tun et al., 2019), and
    beamforming in multi-antenna systems (Pham et al., 2019). Several powerful techniques,
    e.g., convex optimization, game theory, and conventional machine learning (ML)
    have been used to solve these problems. In cases if an optimization problem is
    convex, some well-known methods and off-the-shelf solvers can be useful to derive
    the (near-)optimal solution. However, the convexity feature is rarely available,
    and the underlying problem is usually approximated as a sequence of convex problems.
    Moreover, the computational complexity of approximate algorithms typically increases
    significantly with the optimization dimensionality, e.g., the numbers of IoT devices
    and the quantization levels of channel states. In such a case, heuristic algorithms
    are highly preferred thanks to their features of simplicity and low complexity.
    However, the main drawback of such heuristic schemes is that the convergence to
    the optimal solution and the existence of the optimality are not guaranteed. As
    a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), swarm intelligence (SI) has been widely
    used in the literature. SI methods have the capability to obtain computationally-tractable
    and high-quality solutions while guaranteeing convergence and robustness (Pham
    et al., 2020b). The main advantages of SI and other nature-inspired algorithms
    over conventional approaches like gradient-based and game-theoretic algorithms
    are as follows: • Black-box optimization, i.e, we do not need to know the internal
    mechanisms of a problem and estimate the optimal solutions by tuning the inputs
    while monitoring their changes in the output. Therefore, SI would be beneficial
    when convex optimization methods are not applicable, e.g., when the objective
    function is highly coupled and non-linear even some block variables are fixed
    (Pham et al., 2020b). • SI methods can tune the optimization parameters to balance
    exploration and exploitation, and thereby increasing the chance to get the optimal
    solutions. • Gradient-free optimization, i.e., no need for the gradient information
    as required in many approaches (e.g., backpropagation in ML and FedAvg in federated
    learning). Therefore, SI can avoid several pitfalls such as trapping into local
    optima and slow convergence speed. • Simplicity and easy implementation. Consequently,
    SI methods have been integrated into various systems to solve challenging real-world
    problems in both science and industry. However, many potential and emerging SI
    techniques have not been well investigated, especially in wireless networks. Filling
    this gap, we carry out a contemporary survey on applications of SI techniques
    for NGN. The investigation on emerging issues includes spectrum management and
    resource allocation, wireless caching and edge computing, network security, and
    some other emerging issues for future NGN. 1.1. Swarm intelligence for next-generation
    wireless networks The main challenge in solving optimization problems in NGN is
    an exponential increase in the complexity levels (e.g., in time and computing
    resources). In such cases, algorithms that find exact solutions are not efficient.
    Especially, the existence of many coupling constraints and the massive numbers
    of connected devices, base stations (BSs), channel states, heterogeneous resources,
    etc., make a lot of challenges in finding the exact solutions. Some typical examples
    of such problems are mobility-aware user association in ultra-dense networks,
    signal detection and channel estimation, and routing in IoT networks. As a subset
    of bio-inspired and nature-inspired algorithms, SI studies complex and collective
    behavior of the systems composed of many simple components that can interact with
    other agents locally and with their surrounding environment (Dressler and Akan,
    2010). The particularities of SI have made it a promising solution in various
    research areas, and therefore have been applied to solve an increasing number
    of problems in NGN (Chen et al., 2020). NGNs can realize SI/AI techniques (also
    known as collective intelligence) to address challenging problems, which are not
    effectively solved by conventional approaches. For example, an ant colony optimization
    (ACO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the mobility trajectory for a mobile sink
    in home automation networks (Wang et al., 2015), the particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) method is employed to optimize antenna placement in distributed multi-input
    multi-output (MIMO) systems in Forooshani et al. (2014), and the Firefly algorithm
    (FA) is utilized to find the key update and residence management for enhanced
    handover security (Vien et al., 2019). Another application of SI can be found
    in Jiang et al. (2020), where the PSO is adopted to solve a resource scheduling
    problem in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-MEC systems and generate training samples
    for a deep network. The SI techniques such as ACO and PSO are also leveraged to
    solve emerging problems in 6G wireless systems such as privacy-preserving in 6G
    IoT (Lin et al., 2021), scheduling of diverse 6G IoT services (Wan et al., 2020)
    and distributed autonomous systems (Wang et al., 2020). The above literature has
    shown many promising results, e.g., high performance and computational tractability.
    This observation stimulates the increasing use of SI as a vital tool for solving
    emerging issues in NGN. 1.2. State-of-the-art surveys and our contributions Although
    there are some surveys related to SI, their focuses are not on the applications
    of SI in NGN. Specifically, there have been existing surveys, such as Mavrovouniotis
    et al., 2017, Tan and Ding, 2016 and Ertenlice and Kalayci (2018), but they are
    specifically for other topics rather than NGN, e.g., dynamic optimization (Mavrovouniotis
    et al., 2017), graphical processing unit (GPU)-based implementation (Tan and Ding,
    2016), and portfolio optimization (Ertenlice and Kalayci, 2018). There have been
    also surveys using SI to address particular problems in wireless networks such
    as Saleem et al., 2011, Bitam et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2014, Balusamy et al.,
    2015, Primeau et al., 2018, Anandakumar and Umamaheswari, 2018, Jung et al., 2018
    and Asim et al. (2020). For example, the surveys in Saleem et al. (2011) and Bitam
    et al. (2014) are dedicated to the routing mechanisms in wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), the survey in Zhang et al. (2014)
    presents SI for self-organized networking, the survey in Balusamy et al. (2015)
    presents bio-inspired mechanisms in cloud computing like resource scheduling,
    load balancing, and security, the survey in Primeau et al. (2018) provides reviews
    of various problems (e.g., data aggregation, sensor fusion, scheduling, and security)
    in WSNs using computational intelligence approaches, and the survey in Anandakumar
    and Umamaheswari (2018) reviews bio-inspired SI for social cognitive radio network
    applications. Recently, the survey in Ji et al. (2021) discusses the use of computational
    intelligence (e.g., AI, SI, and fuzzy control system) in NGN-enabled network in
    box architecture. Moreover, there have been some surveys dedicated to the applications
    of a specific SI technique. For example, Zhang et al. (2017) reviews theoretical
    results on the ACO and its applications to routing protocols in WSNs and Zhang
    et al. (2015) presents fundamentals of PSO and its application to WSNs. Recent
    years have also seen various surveys on other AI techniques for NGN such as ML
    for wireless networks (Sun et al., 2019), deep learning (DL) for mobile networking
    (Zhang et al., 2019), FL for mobile edge networks (Lim et al., 2020), and transfer
    learning for future wireless systems (Nguyen et al., 2021a). The above surveys
    either consider the applications of SI for other topics, discuss the applications
    of SI for conventional problems in wireless networks (e.g., routing protocols
    in WSNs), or review other AI disciplines (e.g., ML, DL, and FL). However, we are
    not aware of any survey that specifically discusses the applications of SI for
    emerging issues in NGN. Moreover, most of the related surveys on SI were published
    many years ago, so discussions about emerging problems in NGN have not been well
    investigated. These observations motivate us to conduct this survey with an overview
    of SI and a thorough review of the applications of SI to address emerging issues
    in NGN. For convenience, three major issues are reviewed in this survey, including
    spectrum management and resource allocation, wireless caching and edge computing,
    network security. Also, other important applications of SI for emerging topics
    will be reviewed, such as UAV placement and path planning, clustering and routing
    in IoT, smart city applications, and energy management in smart grid. In summary,
    the main contributions of this survey are summarized as follows. • To provide
    an overview of SI for general readers: We present fundamental knowledge of SI
    and provide a review of representative SI techniques such as PSO, artificial bee
    colony (ABC), ACO, FA, gray wolf optimizer (GWO), and whale optimization algorithm
    (WOA). • To investigate how SI techniques can be used to solve the technical problems
    in NGN: we discuss applications of SI for major issues in NGN, including spectrum
    management and resource allocation, wireless caching and edge computing, data
    privacy and network security, and a number of miscellaneous issues. • To delineate
    key challenges and future research directions: The use of SI in solving problems
    of NGN is being actively investigated and developed, but there is still room for
    improvement in the future. We highlight a number of important challenges and future
    research directions for the use of SI in NGN. Table 1. List of the acronyms. Acronyms

    is shown in Table 1. 2. Swarm intelligence: An overview In this section, we present
    an overview of evolutionary algorithms and a summary of some well-known SI approaches.
    2.1. Fundamentals of SI and stochastic optimization The term “swarm intelligence”
    appeared in Beni and Wang (1993) when cellular robotic systems were empowered
    by the intelligence of swarms. It refers to biological systems, in which multiple
    individuals achieve certain goals with local interaction without any centralized
    control unit. For instance, an ant colony is made of a queen and many workers,
    soldiers, babysitters, etc (Dorigo and Di Caro, 1999). The queen is just responsible
    for laying eggs, but other ants construct the nest, raise larvae, defend the colony,
    collect food, etc. The queen is not a commander, and somehow tasks are coordinated
    and goals are achieved. Ants are proved to communicate locally using pheromone
    and solve complex problems to ensure the survival of their colony. Like other
    types of meta-heuristics including evolutionary, physics-based, and event-based
    ones, SI methods belong to the class of stochastic optimization algorithms (Faris
    et al., 2018). In this class, random mechanisms are prominent as opposed to deterministic
    algorithms, in which there is no random component. Stochastic algorithms start
    the optimization process with a set of randomly generated solutions. Depending
    on the underlying mechanism of the algorithm, this set is improved until the satisfaction
    of an end condition, which may include one or more solutions, as shown in Fig.
    1. The set of solutions is often called the set of candidate solutions since it
    includes potential solutions for a given problem. If the set has one solution,
    the algorithm is individual-based or single-solution. On the other hand, the algorithm
    is called population-based of multi-solution in case of using multiple solutions
    (Faris et al., 2018). Two questions that naturally arise are about the pros and
    cons of stochastic and population-based algorithms as compared to deterministic
    and individual-based ones. On the one hand, deterministic algorithms find the
    same solutions in each run and are usually computationally less expensive. However,
    they tend to be trapped in local optima and mostly require gradient information
    of the problem. Stochastic algorithms benefit from higher local optima avoidance
    thanks to the stochastic component. On the other hand, single-solution algorithms
    use one solution in each step of the optimization, and they generally have lower
    computational complexities than those of population-based techniques. Moreover,
    they have fast convergence but suffer from entrapment in local optima. Population-based
    algorithms are computationally expensive but better avoid trapping into local
    optima. Many studies demonstrate that population-based algorithms can solve complex
    engineering problems with close results (BoussaïD et al., 2013). Due to the advances
    in the area of population-based stochastic algorithms, one might ask whether such
    methods require enhancements. As stated by the No-Free-Lunch theorem (Wolpert
    and Macready, 1997), no algorithm can solve all optimization problems, i.e., one
    algorithm may perform best in a set of problems but maybe worst in other sets.
    This theorem has motivated researchers to improve such algorithms significantly.
    One popular method of improving the performance of stochastic algorithms is to
    hybridize them (Talbi, 2002). Hybrid algorithms can be designed in different ways,
    including but not limited to, borrowing some of the operators from an algorithm,
    sequential use of two or more algorithms, adding chaotic maps, etc. The majority
    of these methods increase the computation cost but result in more accurate results.
    A taxonomy of hybrid meta-heuristics can be found in Talbi (2002). Download :

    general framework of stochastic optimization algorithms. The majority of real-world
    problems also have constraints that should be considered when evaluating candidate
    solutions obtained by SI methods (Gandomi and Yang, 2012). In case of any violation
    at any level, the solution is not practical. Such solutions are called infeasible,
    which means that they are optimal but do not satisfy the constraints. There are
    different methods to handle constraints. Penalty functions are very popular in
    this area (Yeniay, 2005), in which a violated solution is penalized so that it
    does not show better objective values as compared to others. In this way, SI methods
    do not favor them as feasible solutions. 2.2. Popular SI approaches SI is a field
    study that develops computer algorithms mimicking collaborative and collective
    phenomena in nature that leads to problem-solving. Most of the techniques in this
    area are proposed in the form of optimization algorithms that help scientists
    and reactionaries to solve optimization problems (Yang, 2014). The framework that
    such algorithms use when optimizing problems is quite similar, as shown in Fig.
    1. The optimization process starts with a random set of solutions. Each solution
    in this set is a candidate optimal solution for the problem on hand. The accuracy
    of solutions is determined by an objective function, which is also often called
    a cost or a fitness function. The set of candidate solutions is iteratively improved
    until the satisfaction of an end condition. What makes such algorithms different
    from each other is the rules and principles used to improve the solutions. For
    instance, each solution in the set might be considered as a bee, and then foraging
    of bees in nature can be used to improve the set. The ultimate goal is to find
    the best optimal solution for the problem, which is called global optimum. The
    literature shows that SI techniques have been widely used to solve problems in
    both science and industry (Yang, 2014). There are several reasons for the popularity
    of SI. Firstly, swarm-based optimization algorithms mostly used a set of solutions,
    so they benefit from the better capability of avoiding locally optimal solutions,
    which is always an issue in mathematical optimization algorithms. Secondly, an
    optimization problem is considered as a blackbox when using them, so they do not
    need to calculate the derivative of the objective function. This makes them more
    practical than derivative-based algorithms. Finally, they follow natural principles
    that increase their chance of findings a reasonable estimation of the global optimum.
    As a drawback, however, such methods are considered computationally expensive.
    The literature shows that the benefit of SI algorithms outweighs their drawbacks.
    This has been one of the main reasons that we carefully studied and surveyed them
    in this work for NGN. We note that SI can be divided into two main segments, including
    insect swarm algorithms and animal swarm algorithms. GWO (Mirjalili et al., 2014)
    and WOA (Mirjalili and Lewis, 2016) are examples of animal swarm algorithms, whereas
    ABC (Karaboga and Basturk, 2007), ACO (Dorigo and Di Caro, 1999), FA (Yang, 2010),
    bacterial foraging optimization (Das et al., 2009), and glowworm swarm optimization
    (Krishnanand and Ghose, 2009) are examples of insect swarm algorithms. In the
    following, some well-regarded and recent SI algorithms that have been widely used
    in wireless and mobile networking are briefly presented. 2.2.1. Particle swarm
    optimization PSO was initially introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 as a
    global optimization algorithm for nonlinear functions (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995).
    It mimics the social and individual intelligence of birds in a flock when foraging.
    This algorithm considers an optimization problem as an -dimensional space, in
    which is the number of parameters. Each bird represents a candidate solution.
    The birds update their positions using their personal best solutions and the best
    solution obtained by the entire swarm. This allows PSO to constantly search around
    the most promising solutions obtained by the particles while maintaining the best
    one. 2.2.2. Artificial bee colony ABC emulates the natural swarming behavior of
    bees for finding food (Karaboga and Basturk, 2007). Just like any other population-based
    algorithm, there is a population of solutions. This population is divided into
    three classes: worker beers, onlookers, and scouts. Each worker is associated
    with a food source and comes back to the nest to the others by means of the waggle
    dance. Scout bees search for food sources before assigning them to workers. Onlookers
    choose the food source based on the waggle dance of other bees. 2.2.3. Ant colony
    optimization ACO is firstly introduced in 1996 by Dorigo et al. as a nature-inspired
    meta-heuristic method for finding the solution for combinatorial optimization
    problems (Dorigo and Di Caro, 1999). In this algorithm, stigmergy, in which communication
    is done by the manipulation of the environment in swarm, has been used as an inspiration.
    It has been proved that ants communicate by depositing pheromone on the ground
    or objects as a way to convey certain messages to other ants. They use different
    pheromones for different tasks in a colony. For instance, they mark different
    paths to a source of food from their nest to attract other ants for transportation
    purposes. Since the longer path faces a longer period of time for vaporization
    before re-depositing pheromone, the shortest path is chosen automatically using
    this simple communication. In the original version of ACO, the problem should
    be formulated as a graph, each ant is a tour and the objective is to find the
    shortest one. There are two matrices: distance and pheromone. Each ant uses both
    of them to update their paths. After several iterations and updating of both matrices,
    a tour will be established, in which all ants travel through it. This will be
    considered as the best estimation for the problem. There are other variables of
    ACO that can be used for problems with continuous variables, constrained, multiple
    object ices, etc. 2.2.4. Firefly algorithm FA is a meta-heuristic that mimics
    the mating behavior of fire flies in nature (Yang, 2010). This algorithm first
    creates a population of random solutions. Each firefly in the population can attract
    others proportional to its fitness value. The main position updating equation
    is as follows (Yang, 2010): (1) where is a random number in , shows the position
    of th solution, indicates the light absorption coefficient, is the attractiveness
    at the distance , and is a randomization parameter. 2.2.5. Gray wolf optimizer
    GWO is invented by Mirjalili et al. in 2014, which mimics the social hierarchy
    of wolves and their hunting behaviors (Mirjalili et al., 2014). A set of randomly
    generated solutions is first initiated and evolved over multiple iterations. During
    the optimization process, the three best solutions obtained so far are used to
    update the position of others. These best solutions represent the hunting ability
    of alpha wolf, beta wolf, and delta wolf (Mirjalili et al., 2014). The inspiration
    is that the alpha, beta, and delta wolves usually have a better knowledge of the
    location of the prey. The GWO algorithm has been one of the most widely-used recent
    meta-heuristics with a wide range of applications that demonstrate the capability
    of this algorithm in solving real-world problems (Faris et al., 2018). 2.2.6.
    Whale optimization algorithm Proposed by Mirjalili and Lewis (2016) in 2016, the
    WOA is inspired by the bubble net foraging mechanism of humpback whales. This
    is an intelligent way of catching a school of fish by creating and shrinking net
    of bubbles to drive them towards the surface. Just like GWO, a set of whales are
    considered as the candidate solutions for a given optimization problem. Their
    positions are updated using two mechanisms: encircling prey and spiral movement.
    The former method is similar to that in GWO, while in the latter approach, a spiral
    equation is used to update the position. There is a 50% chance of choosing one
    of these methods for each of the whales. 3. SI for spectrum management and resource
    allocation Spectrum management and resource allocation are two key techniques
    to achieve the goals of NGN (e.g., in 5G, it is 1000-fold for throughput, 10-fold
    for spectrum efficiency, and 100-fold for energy efficiency) (Liu et al., 2016).

    Fig. 2. Illustration of a three-tier HetNet, including macro cell, pico cell,
    and femto cell, and the applications of SI. 3.1. Power control and channel allocation
    The power and channel allocation problems play a major role in various wireless
    systems. The term “channel allocation” varies in different scenarios, e.g., user
    clustering/grouping in NOMA, channel/subcarrier allocation in device-to-device
    (D2D) communications and heterogeneous networks (HetNets). For instance, the channels
    occupied by cellular users can be re-used by D2D users on the condition that the
    interference level imposed by D2D users to the co-channel cellular users is smaller
    than a predefined threshold. In such scenarios, important tasks are to adjust
    the transmit power of D2D transmitters and to allocate the channels to D2D users.
    The main focus of this subsection is on the optimization of power control and
    channel allocation in NGN using SI techniques. Fig. 2 illustrates the diagram
    of a three-tier HetNet (macro cell, pico cell, and femto cell) and applications
    of SI. A number of problems in D2D communications have been solved by SI techniques.
    For example, two joint channel allocation and power control problems are studied
    in Xu et al. (2018a), where the channel occupied by one cellular user can be reused
    by multiple D2D pairs. While the first problem considers individual rate requirements
    for cellular users, the second problem requires the total rate of all cellular
    users to be greater than a threshold value. For both problems, the standard continuous
    and binary PSO schemes are used to update power allocation and channel allocation,
    respectively. The proposed algorithm is then compared with a random PSO scheme,
    where channels for D2D pairs are randomly assigned. This work is extended to the
    unlicensed band in Girmay et al. (2019), where D2D pairs causing strong interference
    to cellular users are forced to use the unlicensed band. Simulations demonstrate
    that the proposed approach outperforms the algorithm in Xu et al. (2018a) (only
    licensed band) and the scheme when only one D2D pair is allowed to reuse the same
    licensed channel. It is elaborated in Sun et al. (2019) that coalition game cannot
    achieve high performance and low complexity simultaneously. To solve this challenge,
    the authors consider the concept of “priority sequences” to improve the initialization
    and formation phases of the coalition game. To further improve the D2D sum rate,
    the WOA is used to solve the power control problem. In particular, the objective
    function is designed in a such way that maximizes the D2D sum rate while guaranteeing
    minimum rates of cellular users. Considered as a potential multiple access technology
    for NGN, NOMA has received much interest from the research community. SI is a
    vital alternative for solving many user clustering and power control problems
    in NOMA systems. The work in Masaracchia et al. (2019) adopts PSO to minimize
    the total transmit power by optimizing NOMA pairing decisions. Then, two representative
    scenarios are considered: disaster and UAV communications, where low power consumption
    is an important aspect. An interesting observation from this work is that minimizing
    the transmit power depends on not only channel conditions but also the number
    of sub-channels as well as the available bandwidth. Another application of PSO
    can be found in Jiao et al. (2020) for NOMA resource allocation in satellite-based
    IoT systems. The Lyapunov optimization framework is adopted to transform the long-term
    problem of data and power allocation into a sequence of online problems, which
    are then solved at the corresponding time slots. Compared with the conventional
    optimization approach, the PSO-based scheme achieves better utility in terms of
    average delay, while obtaining a good tradeoff between complexity and memory.
    Very recently, the Harris hawks optimizer (HHO) is utilized to solve the joint
    UAV placement and power allocation problem for NOMA-enabled visible light communications
    (Pham et al., 2020b). The main advantage of HHO over existing methods is that
    the problem can be solved directly instead of solving subproblems iteratively
    in an alternative manner. Moreover, the HHO-based algorithm relaxes the assumption
    of exponential-distance models in existing studies. Simulation results show that
    the HHO-based algorithm is superior to the conventional orthogonal multiple access
    (OMA), power allocation, and random schemes under various settings, and also outperforms
    several SI techniques such as PSO, evolution strategy, and genetic algorithm (GA).
    A combination of D2D and NOMA in MEC systems is studied in Diao et al. (2019).
    In particular, the joint computing resource, power and channel allocation problem
    is investigated and PSO is applied to allocate transmit power within individual
    groups and for different groups. Other applications of SI techniques for edge
    computing can be found in various studies, e.g., joint resource allocation in
    dense HetNets (Guo et al., 2018) and in multi-tier MEC systems (Huynh et al.,
    2020), and task scheduling problem (Jiang et al., 2019a). 3.2. User association
    and load balancing User association refers to the process of associating users
    with their preferred BSs, and load balancing refers to the distribution of workloads
    across multiple BSs. According to these surveys, According to Liu et al. (2016),
    five metrics are mainly used for user association, including outage and coverage
    probability, spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS),
    and fairness. Moreover, the frameworks from convex optimization, game theory,
    and stochastic geometry can be used to provide tractable methods for optimization
    problems of these issues. Henceforth, we focus on reviewing user association and
    load balancing mechanisms, which are designed with the help of SI techniques.
    PSO is adopted in Kuribayashi et al. (2020) to overcome drawbacks of the conventional
    cell range expansion techniques, i.e., users tend to connect to the BS with the
    highest received signal power. Instead of maximizing the sum rate as considered
    in existing literature, this work considers maximizing the number of users with
    satisfactory rate requirements and the number of BSs with at least one connected
    user. PSO is used to optimize the bias values assigned to individual BSs, thus
    implicitly improving the load balancing in dense HetNets. Experiments illustrate
    that the PSO-based algorithm can achieve superior performance (in terms of resource
    utilization and the ratio of satisfactory users) than the unified cell range expansion
    bias approach and classical PSO methods. Since the limited resources of small
    cell BSs and the QoS of users are not jointly considered in existing user association
    mechanisms, the work in Zhong et al. (2019) proposes to use a multi-leader multi-follower
    Stackelberg game to solve this issue in backhaul-limited HetNets. In this context,
    BSs are regarded as the first mover and can adjust the prices according to their
    loads, while users are considered as the follower and compete with each other
    to have the desired association. PSO is adopted at the BSs to determine their
    prices and obtain the perfect Nash equilibrium. The work in Plachy et al. (2019)
    considers a joint BS’s position and user association in a dense network, where
    UAVs can be deployed as flying BSs. Two evolutionary algorithms, PSO and GA, are
    then applied to obtain the optimal UAV’s positions. Both the PSO- and GA-based
    algorithms are shown to outperform the k-means clustering scheme. Interestingly,
    there is a trade-off between PSO and GA, while the PSO-based algorithm has lower
    complexity, the GA-based scheme achieves better network throughput, radio of satisfactory
    users, and active number of flying BSs. Applications of the WOA for user association
    and task offloading decision in edge computing systems are considered in Pham
    et al. (2020c). Game theory and ACO are jointly adopted to address the user association
    problem with multi-radio access technologies (Li et al., 2018). Besides user association
    in ultra-dense HetNets, SI techniques have found lots of applications for load
    balancing in cloud and edge computing. To overcome the issue of unbalanced workload
    in mixed manufacturing, an energy-aware load balancing and job scheduling is studied
    in Wan et al. (2018). Fog nodes are used to abstract and then an energy consumption
    model of smart factory equipment, whereas PSO is employed to find the workload
    allocation solution. An adaptive-step size algorithm based on the glowworm swarm
    optimization (GSO) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is proposed in Dong et al.
    (2019) to find the server selection and improve the load balancing between edge
    servers and the central cloud. For mobile learning services, a dominant FA approach
    is proposed for load balancing among cloud virtual machines in Sekaran et al.
    (2019). The proposed dominant FA algorithm can ensure that learners can receive
    m-learning content without delay, and interestingly the proposed algorithm is
    superior to various methods, including ACB, ACO, and the weighted round-robin
    algorithm. The GWO and PSO are jointly used to find the solution of load balancing
    in cloud computing (Gohil and Patel, 2018). Another work on load balancing in
    cloud computing is Ebadifard and Babamir (2018), where PSO is used to distribute
    the tasks among cloud virtual machines. 3.3. MIMO detection, channel estimation,
    and precoding 3.3.1. MIMO detection In MIMO systems, the receiver may use some
    detection strategies to estimate the transmitted symbols that may be corrupted
    by interference and noise over the medium. However, the detection complexity highly
    depends on the system size (e.g., the number of antennas and the modulation scheme),
    matrix multiplication and inversion operations (Albreem et al., 2019). The maximum
    likelihood detection (MLD) is an optimal algorithm in terms of the probability.
    Unfortunately, the MLD searches over a very huge solution space and the complexity
    would increase exponentially with respect to the number of transmitter antennas.
    For instance, to obtain the optimal signal for 64-QAM, the detector needs to perform
    enumerations for an MIMO system with antennas at the transmitter to support 16-QAM.
    SI algorithms can be considered as alternative approaches for MIMO detection problems.
    The first application of ACO for the MIMO detection problem is proposed in Lain
    and Chen (2010). Inspired by the ACO algorithm, the MIMO MLD can be formulated
    as the shortest path problem, in which each transmit antenna is regarded as a
    city and the transmitted symbols are viewed as the potential paths to a specific
    city. Corresponding to a solution component in ACO, a similar concept of path
    movement is defined in Lain and Chen (2010). The solution component indicates
    the solution that the antenna should transmit the symbol . The cost function to
    estimate transmitted symbols is then converted to a heuristic value by means of
    a sigmoid function. Next, the pheromone levels and Euclidean distance values are
    used to calculate the transition probabilities, which are used to select the transmitted
    symbols. To be more specific, the symbol with a smaller distance has a higher
    chance to be selected by the artificial ant. To avoid the convergence to local
    optima in the original ACO, a modified ACO scheme is adopted, in which ants are
    enabled to have non-identical sets of pheromone trails, i.e., the hard decision
    symbol used in estimating the distance is now replaced by the tentatively chosen
    symbol. For a 16-QAM 16 × 16 MIMO system, ACO can achieve a near-MLD SER performance
    when the number of ants is around 20,000. The work in Lain and Chen (2010) can
    be considered as a pioneering study on SI for the MIMO detection problem. However,
    the advantage of the proposed ACO algorithm in Lain and Chen (2010) is limited
    by a large number of ants and slow convergence. A hybrid algorithm, as a combination
    of ACO and PSO, is proposed in Mandloi and Bhatia (2016). Unlike the ACO and PSO
    based MIMO detectors, the concepts of distance in ACO and velocity in PSO are
    jointly considered to create a new probability metric, i.e., the fitness value
    is calculated as a weighted sum of the distances traveled by the solutions and
    the velocity of each solution. The proposed hybrid algorithm offers several advantages
    compared to the original ACO and PSO: (1) avoiding convergence to locally optimal
    solutions, (2) faster convergence, (3) lower computational complexity, and (4)
    removing the sensitivity to the choice of initial solutions as in Khan et al.
    (2007). The simulation results in Mandloi and Bhatia (2016) show that the proposed
    scheme performs close to the sphere decoding detector and is superior to the existing
    ACO detection mechanisms in Lain and Chen (2010) and Mandloi and Bhatia (2015).
    More specifically, at the target BER of , the proposed hybrid algorithm attains
    2.5 dB and dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio with respect to the ACO algorithms
    in Lain and Chen (2010) and Mandloi and Bhatia (2015), respectively. More recently,
    the FA algorithm is used to investigate a robust detection in Datta and Bhatia
    (2019); however, the detector developed in this work is applicable for MIMO systems
    with 4-QAM signaling only. For future work, detection schemes for massive MIMO
    systems with higher modulation orders can be investigated. 3.3.2. MIMO beamforming
    Beamforming plays a major role in MIMO systems because the transmitter needs to
    direct the spatial data-stream at the intended receiver. Basically, beamforming
    implies that multiple antennas are used to adjust the wave directions by appropriately
    changing the magnitude and phase of each antenna in the array. There are three
    types of beamforming in multi-antenna wireless systems: digital beamforming, analog
    beamforming, and hybrid digital–analog beamforming (Molisch et al., 2017). SI
    and bio-inspired techniques are promising candidates to solve beamforming optimization
    problems, which represents the theme of this subsection. The work in Hefnawi (2016)
    considers the concept of cooperative MIMO in cognitive radio enabled WSNs. In
    particular, a very large number of sensors are divided into different clusters
    and each cluster is treated as a virtual antenna in a multi-cluster MIMO system.
    The PSO approach is applied to optimize the transmit beamforming vectors so as
    to maximize the ergodic capacity of each cluster. The main benefit is that it
    does not require gradient search operations, thus reducing the complexity significantly.
    Simulation results show that the PSO-based scheme can achieve competitive system
    capacity, and interestingly impressive performance can be obtained when the number
    of clusters is small. Owing to the importance of spectrum sensing in cognitive
    radio networks, various SI-inspired methods to improve spectrum sensing have been
    proposed in the last few years. For example, a hybrid PSO-gravitational search
    algorithm (GSA) is studied in Eappen and Shankar (2020) for optimizing the performance
    of joint spectrum sensing and energy efficiency, and a random walk GWO method
    is investigated in Karthikeyan et al. (2019) for deriving sensing and data transmission
    schedules. To enable low-complexity and efficient mmWave massive MIMO communications,
    various studies have been dedicated to beamforming optimization. The work in Zhu
    et al. (2019a) jointly optimizes transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) beamforming vectors
    and power allocation for an NOMA-mmWave MIMO system. Since the Tx-beamforming
    sub-problem is non-convex and the original PSO may be trapped into local optima,
    a boundary-compressed PSO approach is devised. Particularly, two boundary values,
    inner and outer, are introduced, and the inner value increases linearly during
    the course of optimization. A similar study can be found in Xiao et al. (2019),
    where the max–min problem is optimized and PSO is used to obtain the upper bound
    value. Also using the boundary-compressed PSO, hybrid beamforming is considered
    in Zhu et al. (2019b), which achieves a better performance than the OMA and fully
    digital beamforming cases in terms of spectral efficiency and energy efficiency,
    respectively. SI approaches are also considered to solve various problems in MIMO
    systems. The work in Souto et al. (2020) considers a reconfigurable intelligent
    surface (RIS) assisted MIMO system. However, estimating CSI accurately in RIS-aided
    MIMO systems is a challenging task, and state-of-the-art solutions may not be
    practical because of large overheads, high complexity, and hardware challenges
    (Souto et al., 2020). To solve these challenges of channel estimation, the authors
    in Souto et al. (2020) adopt PSO to optimize active beamforming at the BS and
    passive beamforming at the RIS. Unlike conventional methods, the PSO-based method
    is not dependent on CSI acquisition and does not require one RF chain for each
    RIS passive element, thus reducing the cost and energy consumption. 3.3.3. MIMO
    channel estimation Channel estimation is a vital means to enhance the overall
    performance of wireless systems. With accurate channel estimation, the potential
    advantages of massive MIMO systems (and other networks as well) can be exploited
    to enhance the network performance. Nevertheless, there are several challenges
    related to channel estimation problems, e.g., time-varying and frequency-selective
    channels, pilot contamination, a large number of channels (e.g., in an RIS based
    system), etc. In this part, we focus on channel estimation using SI algorithms.
    Among SI techniques, PSO is a vital alternative for well-known channel estimators
    such as minimum mean squared error and least-squares. In Knievel and Hoeher (2012),
    PSO and cooperative PSO (CPSO) are applied for channel estimation in terms of
    mean squared error performance. The CPSO is highly preferable when the search
    space has a very high dimension since the whole search space is partitioned into
    smaller subsets, and multiple swarms (i.e., solutions) are maintained at a time
    instance instead of only one swarm in PSO. Thus, the CPSO is suitable for massive
    MIMO systems. The channel estimation problem becomes more difficult when it couples
    with other optimization variables. For example, the work in Zhang et al. (2013)
    investigates a joint channel estimation and multi-user detection problem, which
    is solved by four evolutionary techniques (including genetic algorithm, repeated
    weighted boosting search, PSO, and differential evolution). In particular, an
    iterative algorithm is designed by applying continuous versions for channel estimation
    and binary versions for multi-user detection. Recently, the work in Jiang et al.
    (2019b) applies an enhanced variant of the WOA and compressed sensing to allocate
    the pilot in underwater acoustic orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
    systems. To improve the original WOA, three strategies are investigated, including
    (1) good initialization to avoid the prematurity issue, (2) chaotic switching
    to prevent traps from falling into a local minimum, and (3) nonlinear parameters
    to appropriately adjust the transition between exploration and exploitation. The
    proposed enhanced WOA is shown to have better performance than some other algorithms
    such as PSO, original WOA, and GA. Table 2. Summary of the state-of-the-art SI

    3.4. Summary In this section, we survey the applications of SI for spectrum management
    and resource allocation in NGN. In particular, we discuss three aspects, including
    power control and channel allocation, user association and load balancing, and
    MIMO applications (signal detection, channel estimation, and precoding). As a
    prominent SI approach in the last two decades, PSO is widely used for many problems.
    However, new SI techniques may find their suitability and practicality in several
    other applications. For example, since the original ACO is proposed to solve mixed-integer
    problems, it is highly suitable for MIMO signal detection. Another observation
    is that since each SI approach has its distinct features and disadvantages, combining
    multiple SI techniques to solve a specific problem is widely investigated and
    the combined algorithm typically outperforms individual algorithms. Besides, recent
    SI techniques have demonstrated better performance than the old ones, but the
    comparison among recent advances is usually not available in the literature. In
    summarizing this section, the reviewed literature, used techniques, and highlights
    are summarized in Table 2. 4. SI for wireless caching and edge computing Caching
    at the wireless edge has emerged as a great solution to meet the traffic requirement
    in NGN and to improve the performance of low-latency applications (Liu et al.,
    2016). Meanwhile, edge computing (e.g., MEC and fog computing) has been developed
    to distribute cloud resources from the central cloud to the network edges, and
    thus enabling new compute-intensive and latency-critical applications at the device
    level. 4.1. Wireless caching Back to several decades ago, caching has been developed
    for various application domains such as web caching and memory caching in operating
    systems. As of massive traffic, network densification, and stringent services
    in NGN, the centralized caching cannot accommodate user demands (Liu et al., 2016).
    Therefore, the concept of wireless/edge caching has been recently studied. Generally,
    content placement and content delivery are the two main problems in wireless caching.
    While the former decides the location and size of each content chunk, the latter
    is about how to deliver the content to the requesters (Liu et al., 2016). Indeed,
    SI techniques have found their applications in achieving competitive performance
    for wireless caching systems. Caching at the network edge is the main theme and
    has been considered in many studies. The work in Li et al. (2019) proposes a socially
    aware caching mechanism in D2D-enabled for radio access networks. The proposed
    scheme is composed of three main phases, in which the first phase deals with the
    clustering of fog nodes, each one is typically located at a corresponding BS.
    After the clustering is completed, a center user scheme is proposed to select
    users within the coverage of each fog node to cache data for the other users.
    The caching problem at the selected users is then formulated as a discrete problem
    and then solved by ACO. Numerical results demonstrate that the ACO-based approach
    outperforms several benchmarks in terms of cache hit ratio and average total delay.
    Another work on wireless caching at the edge is considered in Jin et al. (2019).
    In particular, a new concept, namely information-centric virtual content network,
    is proposed by combining network function virtualization (NFV) and content-centric
    network. Based on the proposed architecture, an optimization problem is studied
    to minimize the total weighted hops in a HetNet. The problem is solved by ACO
    and compared with several baseline schemes like cache everything everywhere and
    popularity-based schemes. The autonomous vehicular edge framework is proposed
    in Feng et al. (2017) to exploit redundant resources and realize in-vehicle applications.
    This work also proposes a caching algorithm and adopts ACO to solve the workload
    allocation problem. Cache-enabled UAV communications are studied in Wu et al.
    (2019), where a rotary-wing UAV is deployed to cache files and to serve a number
    of downlink vehicles. For given solutions of trajectory and content delivery,
    PSO is used to solve the binary content placement problem. Simulations show a
    small optimality gap between the PSO-based scheme and the optimal caching solution.
    Very recently, the work in Huang et al. (2020) considers a caching decision problem
    for the Internet of vehicles (IoV) and proposes to deploy a quantum PSO based
    algorithm at the edge to obtain the caching solutions. HetNet is a key enabler
    to enhance the performance of cache-based wireless systems. As shown in Yang et
    al. (2016), HetNet with caching capabilities (popular contents can be cached at
    multi-tiers, including macro BS, relay, and nearby users), can achieve a throughput
    gain of 57.3% compared with that of the HetNet without caching (i.e., popular
    contents are cached at the macro BS only). A caching mechanism is investigated
    in Tan et al. (2019a), where full-duplex relays are deployed and the mobility
    patterns of users are modeled to improve the throughput gain. Illustration of
    a cache-enabled three-tier HetNet is shown in Fig. 3. More specifically, there
    are possibly four cases for a content request, i.e., the requested content is
    available at (1) the local cache, (2) at least nearby users, (3) nearby relays,
    and (4) the macro BS. For a given set of cached contents, a PSO-based approach
    is proposed to solve the joint caching placement problem whose objective is to
    maximize the network throughput. The main advantages of PSO are near-optimal performance
    and very low complexity when it is compared with the optimal exhaustive search
    algorithm. Similar to Tan et al. (2019a), the work in Ali et al. (2020) also exploits
    the mobility patterns of users to improve the offloading probability, but the
    use of an adaptive bat algorithm is shown to outperform the PSO-based approach.
    In order to solve the inter-dependencies among the density of HetNets, dynamics
    of harvested energy, and diverse QoS requirements of users, the work in Zhang
    et al. (2020) considers a caching problem so as to minimize the total energy consumed
    by the small cell BSs (SBSs) and backhaul links. Furthermore, based on the energy
    level and traffic offloaded from the macro BS, a binary PSO scheme is studied
    to decide the sleeping status of SBSs. Download : Download high-res image (516KB)

    HetNet, where the content can be cached at the local device, nearby users, relays,
    and macro BS. 4.2. Computation offloading Along with the massive connectivity
    and diverse QoS requirements, computation offloading has been regarded as a key
    solution for many compute-intensive and latency-critical applications and services
    (Pham et al., 2020, Guan and Boukerche, 2021). According to Pham et al. (2020a),
    besides network optimization, game theory, and AI, many computation offloading
    (sometimes referred to as task scheduling and task allocation in the literature)
    problems can be solved effectively by SI techniques with competitive performance
    and low complexity. The application of bees swarm for computation offloading in
    fog computing is examined in Bitam et al. (2018), which shows significant improvements
    over the GA and PSO algorithms. In Mishra et al. (2018), the service allocation
    problem for industrial application is optimized by three SI techniques, including
    the continuous and binary PSO, and bat algorithm. The work in Zhu et al. (2019)
    optimizes the task allocation problem to achieve a trade-off between latency and
    quality in vehicular edge computing systems. More precisely, vehicles can migrate
    their workloads to other vehicles with computing capabilities and stationary edge
    servers. The mixed-integer task allocation problem is first solved by the linear
    programming method, but it has high computational complexity. Therefore, this
    work proposes a binary PSO based algorithm to achieve efficient solutions. Using
    real-world traces to model the mobility of edge servers, PSO is shown to have
    lower service latency than the linear programming method when the quality is relaxed,
    but it is not preferred to use when the quality requirement becomes stricter.
    To support latency-sensitive IoV applications, the work in Hou et al. (2020) considers
    combining software-defined networking (SDN) and edge computing, and proposes a
    holistic architecture. Moreover, this work investigates a reliable computation
    offloading scheme by considering the reprocessing latency. To overcome the difficulties
    of non-convexity and NP-hardness, PSO is utilized to design a fault-tolerant algorithm.
    Motivated by the fact that offloading tasks to stationary nodes (e.g., road side
    units) is highly expensive, the allocation of tasks among vehicles is considered
    in Chen et al. (2020). More specifically, a vehicle may offload its computation
    task to one among multiple idle vehicles and the max–min completion time is optimized.
    To deal with the challenge that an idle vehicle shall not participate in the tasking
    processing, a PSO-based algorithm is proposed. Recently, various PSO variants
    are proposed task allocation, e.g., improved discrete PSO algorithm in Shao et
    al. (2021) and two slow-movement PSO schemes in Zhang et al. (2020). Utilizing
    IS for computation offloading of IoT applications has also been received much
    attention. To achieve the load balancing among fog nodes and latency requirements
    of IoT delay-sensitive applications, two algorithms based on ACO and binary PSO
    are investigated in Hussein and Mousa (2020). A number of simulations are conducted
    to verify two proposed algorithms, and it is observed that the proposed ACO-based
    approach performs better than the round-robin and PSO algorithms in terms of average
    completion time and load balancing. A recent study in Sharma and Saini (2020)
    considers the problem of task allocation in data deduplication for industrial
    IoT applications such as air pollution. In particular, a four-layer architecture
    is considered, IoT device layer, fog layer, cloud layer, and service layer. A
    multi-objective WOA algorithm, including node degree, residual energy, and distance
    to other devices, is proposed to divide IoT devices into multiple clusters. After
    that, each cluster head reports hash information (used for checking data duplication)
    to a fog node, that is selected by another SI approach, namely fast artificial
    fish swarm optimization. The potentials of SI techniques for IoT offloading applications
    can also be found in Adhikari et al. (2020) and Huang et al. (2020). An accelerated
    PSO scheme is proposed in Adhikari et al. (2020) for solving the application offloading
    problem, and the fitness function is designed from multiple parameters such as
    resource utilization and total (computing and memory) cost. In order to minimize
    the total energy consumption for latency-sensitive applications, the work in Huang
    et al. (2020) studies a joint task offloading decision and computation resource
    allocation problem and proposes a bilevel optimization approach to get the solution.
    As most offloading decisions are infeasible due to the latency constraints, a
    prune policy is first proposed to eliminate infeasible solutions. Then, ACO and
    monotonic optimization are used to obtain the upper and lower values, respectively,
    so as to achieve the offloading decisions and to optimize resource allocation.
    The simulation results confirm that the bilevel method in Huang et al. (2020)
    can approach almost the same performance as the optimal solution, while it is
    superior to several baseline schemes. 4.3. Joint resource optimization The fact
    is that NGN supports not only communication services as in earlier network generations,
    but also caching, computing, and control (Pham et al., 2020a). In this context,
    the optimization variables can computing resources (e.g., local central processing
    unit (CPU) frequency and edge computing capabilities), radio resources (e.g.,
    transmit power, subcarrier, and time allocation), and scheduling decisions (e.g.,
    what to cache and where to remotely execute), whereas the objective can be energy
    consumption, delay minimization, or both (Pham et al., 2019). The work in Hu et
    al. (2019) considers a joint computing, caching, and communication problem in
    vehicular networks. Due to complex environments and vehicle mobility, a two-time
    scale is proposed to solve the problem, where PSO and deep reinforcement learning
    are used at the large timescale and short timescale, respectively. More specifically,
    the actions to be optimized at the large timescale are caching placement decisions
    (i.e., the caching location and size) at the road side units and offloading decisions
    from the vehicles. In the meanwhile, the actions at the small timescale are the
    assignment of road side units to each vehicle and the offloading decisions. It
    is reasonable since a vehicle is now under the coverage of a road side unit, but
    it shall not be in a future time instance. To deal with the mobility and intermittency
    of edge nodes, the work in Mseddi et al. (2019) investigates a joint problem of
    container placement and task scheduling, which aims at maximizing the number of
    satisfied tasks subject to a number of constraints, such as the resource utilization
    of each fog node should be less than one and the number of requests to all fog
    nodes of a user should be less than its total load. Two solution approaches are
    proposed: a greedy approach and a metaheuristic which is designed based on the
    PSO algorithm. Real-world data experiments show that the proposed PSO with reparation
    achieves performance close to the optimum, especially in the static scenario,
    whereas it outperforms the Folo in terms of success probability. The application
    of the WOA to solve a joint task scheduling and local CPU frequencies is investigated
    in Peng et al. (2019). Interestingly, the WOA can achieve a shorter task completion
    time compared with PSO, while both achieve almost the same energy consumption.
    In a hierarchical edge computing system, the work in Huynh et al. (2020) utilizes
    PSO to optimize the computation offloading decisions and allocates computing resources
    by a close form solution. Compared with three baseline schemes, the PSO-based
    algorithm can reduce the computation overhead significantly. SI has also been
    leveraged to solve the optimization problems when different technologies are combined,
    for example, NOMA, D2D, UAV, and blockchain. The combination of NOMA and MEC in
    densely HetNets with applications of PSO is considered in Seng et al. (2018).
    Firstly, the total utility of all the BSs is optimized by a user association mechanism.
    This is followed by a resource allocation problem, which aims at maximizing the
    network energy efficiency and is solved by PSO to attain an efficient solution
    at reasonable complexity. The proposed PSO-based algorithm is verified to outperform
    two existing algorithms: OMA and a mechanism that uses the minimum-distance as
    the design metric. The use of SI for NOMA-MEC systems can also be found in Pham
    et al. (2020), where both WOA and its binary version are used to jointly solve
    a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem of computation offloading and resource
    allocation. The work in Zhu et al. (2018) minimizes the energy consumption by
    jointly optimizing radio and computing resources under constraints on latency
    and spectrum restriction. In particular, a UAV shall partially offload the task
    to one among multiple terrestrial edge servers, which may cooperate with the other
    servers to process the received workload. PSO and simulated annealing are combined
    to obtain the solution for a computation resource allocation problem, which would
    avoid the trap of falling into local optima by the original PSO. More recently,
    a learning based CPSO approach is investigated in Sun et al. (2021) to solve the
    task priority and resource allocation in MEC-enabled UAV forest fire detection
    systems. From simulation results, the proposed learning CPSO approach is superior
    to several benchmarks (e.g., cooperative genetic programming, cooperative GA,
    and multi-agent PSO) in terms of the best and average response time. SI techniques
    have also found potentials for blockchain-based edge computing systems. More recently,
    to enable mobile blockchain for e-commerce services, Deng et al. (2019) investigates
    a joint server selection and computing resource allocation problem, which is then
    solved by several metaheuristic approaches, including GA, simulated annealing
    algorithm, ABC, and PSO. Table 3. Summary of the state-of-the-art SI techniques

    of SI for wireless caching and edge computing problems are reviewed in this section.
    More specifically, we review three main problems in edge computing systems, including
    wireless caching, computation offloading, and joint resource optimization. Since
    edge systems comprise many optimization variables along with environment dynamics
    and mobility, typically problems are very challenging to be solved to get the
    globally optimal solution. Similar to the earlier section, we observe that ACO
    and PSO optimizers are widely used in the literature thanks to their high performance
    and originality (i.e., ACO is originally developed to solve discrete problems).
    However, recent approaches still find their applications and advances in improving
    the network performance, e.g. WOA in Pham et al. (2020c) and Peng et al. (2019).
    The review in this section opens many opportunities to use SI techniques for optimizing
    edge computing, when combined with new NGN technologies such as terahertz (THz)
    communications and RIS. To summarize this section, representative reviewed references,
    used techniques, and highlights are presented in Table 3. 5. SI for network security
    Security is always a key concern for any network generation. It has become a major
    task due to the changes and complexities in underlying network and the emergence
    of many technologies and services. In this section, we discuss the applications
    of SI in dealing with security problems in NGN. 5.1. Access control Access control
    mechanisms aim to prevent malicious users and attacks from accessing resources,
    e.g., computing or storage resources. The use of access control approaches such
    as attribute-based access control is important for ensuring flexible network management
    against security attacks, by allowing only legitimate users and devices to use
    the network resource while blocking any external threats for security improvement.
    SI is able to provide viable solutions to achieve efficient access control for
    5G networks. For example, an extended attribute-based access control method is
    proposed in Chang et al. (2019) to enhance the confidentiality and integrity of
    SDN. For improving the security of the access data flow in the SDN switch, PSO
    is used to obtain the optimal path of multi-level security and multi-switching
    nodes where SDN switches are considered as environmental attributes. The simulation
    results confirm high security capability achieved by PSO with a low network response
    delay. Another effort for access control in SDN is in Abdulqadder et al. (2018).
    More specifically, an enhanced PSO-based routing protocol with a cuckoo search
    is proposed to support SDN controllers in route selection with respect to the
    available links, latency, and controller load balancing. The key purpose of Abdulqadder
    et al. (2018) is to realize the optimal routing for improving the QoS while minimizing
    the malicious user access possibility with efficient threat prevention. Moreover,
    SI-based algorithms can provide access control for cloud-based 5G networks. In
    fact, how to implement intelligent user access control in the cloud computing
    environments is highly important in the context of complex user patterns (e.g.,
    cloud data storage, cloud data computing, and cloud data flow tracking). SI has
    emerged as a promising technique to enable smart data access analysis for security
    guarantees (Dadhich et al., 2014), by supporting cryptography algorithms in deducing
    optimum keys based on statistical probability for cryptanalysis that is necessary
    for network transmission monitoring. Additionally, SI is also applied to cloud
    scheduling tasks (e.g., data offloading) (Islam and Habiba, 2012a). In this case,
    an ACO-enabled algorithm is derived to solve data-intensive scheduling problems,
    i.e., task level scheduling and access reliability levels, with respect to overall
    throughput, running cost, scheduling deadline. The simulation results from using
    the ACO scheme with cloud datasets in virtual machines confirm a better security
    level compared to the traditional baselines. Further, SI-based algorithms such
    as PSO can also solve the multi-objective time-varying problem in cloud computing
    (Liu et al., 2020), by optimizing the execution time and task priority. 5.2. Data
    privacy In NGN, network operators and mobile users interconnect and form business
    models where a large amount of information can be exchanged over the networks.
    The ubiquitous information sharing among data users over the mobile networks may
    raise many critical privacy concerns such as data leakages and user information
    attacks. Therefore, NGN must consider an end-to-end data protection approach to
    provide high degrees of user privacy where SI can provide highly efficient solutions.
    Indeed, SI-based methods such as PSO can build security-preserved network models
    for IoT networks (Rashid and Pajooh, 2019) that can be divided into a multi-layer
    clustering system using decentralized blockchain technologies. At each cluster,
    a local data privacy mechanism is designed to perform self-clustering for IoT
    that optimizes the network lifetime with the data integrity enhancement. PSO is
    also applied to solve different privacy in data clustering with a particle subswarms
    collaborative clustering scheme (Census et al., 2019). The aim is to group particles
    to enhance the collaboration between subswarms in a fashion the datasets are processed
    separately and only coefficient information is exchanged. This would solve the
    data clustering problem without compromising data privacy requirements. To realize
    fractal intelligent data privacy preservation in social IoT networks, PSO has
    been considered in Wei et al. (2018) thanks to its high optimization ability by
    simulating bird predation behavior. A social data privacy protection model is
    formulated based on the security situation prediction scheme, and a PSO algorithm
    is adopted to solve the formulated privacy problem, showing a significant improvement
    in the privacy protection accuracies over the traditional schemes, such as semisupervised
    learning methods and matrix factorization schemes. In NGN, data privacy protection
    is an urgent problem. The work in Budhraja et al. (2017) shows the first attempt
    to use SI techniques in order to preserve data privacy in SDN-based 5G networks.
    The current SDN routing schemes often focus on data packet transfer without privacy
    concerns, e.g., information leakage, in the communication channels among SDN controllers
    and users. SI-based algorithms such as ACO can arrive to build distributed routing
    optimization models by taking privacy exposure and risk definition into consideration.
    Each controller selects some different features such as data packet types, network
    topology, and data routing history, which are classified by K-mean learning. Then,
    these classification outputs are used as the parameters of the ACO-based real-time
    routing scheme, aiming to find the optimal route with minimum privacy risks. The
    application of SI to deal with privacy issues in cloud-based networks is also
    considered in Madan and Goswami (2018). In cloud computing, the real-time data
    transmission and the complex data usage patterns make it challenging to protect
    data privacy against external attacks and cloud third parties. Therefore, a new
    dragon PSO algorithm is suggested to establish a k-anonymization criteria to derive
    the fitness function that represents the privacy and utility levels of cloud migration
    services. The experiments using an Adult database verify the efficiency of the
    privacy-preserved model against information loss risks (Madan and Goswami, 2018).
    Moreover, the work in Stévant et al. (2018) presents a data privacy-preserved
    PSO algorithm for cloud computing. Especially, the traditional cloud is replaced
    by a cloud microservice that is deployed at the mobile device instead of the remote
    cloud. In this regard, a quality of experience-aware model is developed to minimize
    the application response time with privacy awareness. Download : Download high-res

    PSO-based model for user network authentication. 5.3. Network authentication Network
    authentication mechanisms are used to authenticate the identity of an entity,
    e.g., data requestors, data access users, in order to detect and prevent malicious
    network attacks. SI can provide new intelligent network authentication solutions
    for mobile networks towards 5G. For any authentication modes in wireless networks,
    the evaluation of authentication depends on two main classes: authorized and unauthorized.
    SI can be used to build intelligent user authentication systems in wireless networks,
    as illustrated in Fig. 4. Here, SI algorithms such as PSO can perform user classification
    in off-line and on-line stages based on user patterns, e.g., access frequency,
    data usage behaviors, in order to determine whether this user is a legitimate
    network entity or not. Recently, some research efforts have been made to apply
    SI techniques to improve network authentication. For example, the study in Darabseh
    and Namin (2015) builds a user authentication system to capture the user patterns
    in minimal time including two phases: the enrollment phase for data capturing
    and pattern learning, and the verification phase for feature extraction and comparison
    with the biometric pattern. In particular, the feature selection is done by a
    PSO algorithm associated with support vector machine and Naïve Bayesian. To perform
    security protocols in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), an ACO-based approach is
    proposed in Junnarkar et al. (2018) with the objective of securing communications
    and authenticating users in MANET in the presence of attacks while ensuring low
    network latency. The ACO algorithm is able to learn the optimal routing path with
    data reliability (e.g., authenticated data access) and QoS preservation. A joint
    framework using ACO and elliptic curve cryptography is considered in Saad et al.
    (2016) for VANET. The focus is on analyzing some primary issues in VANET, such
    as security improvement including data validation and authorization services,
    and randomness minimization of existing traffic management systems. For security
    provision, a mutual authentication scheme is integrated with learning using radio
    frequency identification to detect intelligently any false vehicular communication
    messages (i.e. wrong traffic messages) in dynamic vehicular settings. In cognitive
    radio networks, how to enable secure and trusted communication is highly important.
    Some learning-based solutions such as PSO may be very useful in the authentication
    classification and attack verification (Balamurugan and Kumar, 2020). In this
    work, a mutual authentication mechanism is designed where the user identity and
    real identity are produced by both the transmitter and receiver for authentication
    validation enabled by a PSO-based access feature selection. The simulation results
    confirm a high user authentication level (i.e., detection accuracy) with improved
    system throughput and enhanced packet delivery ratio, compared to the traditional
    schemes. Enabled by SI that forms a closed-loop system like swarms in humans when
    the groups can perform better in analyzing and achieving the consensus, an SI-inspired
    intelligence approach is also proposed in Rauniyar et al. (2018) to deal with
    cognitive radio authentication. Three use cases are employed to evaluate with
    vehicular fog, including measurable security, privacy, and dependability of autonomous
    vehicles, showing a better security level and more reliable authentication in
    comparison with non-intelligence schemes. SI has been also adopted in Islam and
    Habiba (2012b) to build a self-defensive multi-layered cloud computing platform
    that is promising to develop self-aware 5G systems where entities such as users
    and service providers can work together for cooperation in network operations
    including authentication, based on the concept of SI. Table 4. Summary of the

    Kalaivani et al. (2019) ABC An ABC-based optimization classifier is built to perform
    classification of the cloud data packets for intrusion identification that is
    potential to solve DoS attacks. Sharma and Kaul (2018) SI A dolphin SI is investigated
    where the biological features associated with SI can be used to optimize the detection
    and accuracy of intrusion identification. Xu et al. (2018b) WOA A WOA scheme is
    proposed for intrusion detection in wireless networks that can achieve better
    classification accuracy with using fewer feature subsets. Prasath and Perumal
    (2019) PSO A binary PSO algorithm is designed to identify unauthorized users and
    detect data attacks in SDN. 5.4. Attack detection Attack detection aims to identify
    and prevent any attacks and threats to wireless networks. In the context of 5G
    where attackers become much more sophisticated, intelligent attack detection solutions
    are of paramount importance for 5G security. SI has the potential to provide feasible
    solutions for efficient attack detection. Indeed, SI can build security decision
    making models to fight against malicious threats and intrusions based on security
    postures and intelligence information using full-text search, mathematical optimization,
    logical reasoning, and probability analytic. For a typical use case, the work
    in Kalaivani et al. (2019) tries to adopt SI for intrusion detection in cloud
    computing. An ABC-based optimization classifier is built to perform classification
    of the cloud data packets for intrusion identification that is potential to solve
    security issues such as denial-of-service (DoS) attack, replay attack, and flooding
    attacks in cloud computing. For intrusion detection systems (IDS) in VANET, dolphin
    SI has been investigated in Sharma and Kaul (2018) where the biological features
    associated with SI can be used to optimize the detection and accuracy of IDS.
    Also, the dolphin swarm behaviors such as hunting and spraying have demonstrated
    the feasibility for detection and prevention of malicious nodes, e.g., malicious
    vehicles, and data attacks from the VANET. The SI-enhanced IDS is also considered
    in Xu et al. (2018b) for wireless networks. The simulation from KDD CUP 99 dataset
    shows the proposed WOA scheme in Xu et al. (2018b) can achieve better intrusion
    detection accuracy, compared to its counterparts such as the PSO algorithm. SI
    has been applied to attack detection tasks in SDN-based 5G networks. For instance,
    a binary PSO algorithm is designed in Prasath and Perumal (2019) to identify unauthorized
    users and detect data attacks in SDN. First, a security rule is defined by using
    an ML-based random forest algorithm and prediction results obtained from the training
    procedure with the KDDTest21FS dataset. Then, PSO is applied to feature selection
    that is necessary for user classification. The proposed scheme not only achieves
    high attack identification accuracy but also brings a lower detection sensitivity.
    In Ammal and VinodChandra (2018), a bio-inspired algorithm is developed for attack
    detection in SDN controllers which can perform a data flow management function
    for user access monitoring. To prevent distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
    detection in SDN, Dayal and Srivastava (2018) investigates an optimized PSO learning
    approach. In this case, how to differentiate the DDoS attack traffic from the
    genuine traffic is a challenge. Motivated by this, a PSO-based classification
    model is derived to classify the network traffic patterns. The real-time implementation
    of the proposed system model indicates the practicality of the proposed SI algorithm
    for handling the attacks and minimizing the data loss risk for legitimate users.
    5.5. Summary This section reviews the applications of SI for problems related
    to network security in NGN. The most popular SI technique used in network security
    is PSO that can provide flexible and intelligent solutions for security in NGN
    platforms such as cloud, MEC, SDN, and NFV. Reviewing the available literature,
    we discuss the roles of SI in four key security services, including access control,
    data privacy, network authentication, and attack detection. In fact, SI is able
    to improve the security of the access data flow in NGN, e.g., SDN systems, where
    PSO-based algorithms are useful to provide multi-level access control mechanisms,
    aiming at minimizing the malicious user access possibility with efficient threat
    prevention (Chang et al., 2019, Abdulqadder et al., 2018). Enabled by the high
    optimization ability by simulating bird predation behavior, SI-based methods such
    as PSO can build security-preserved network models for IoT to promote universal
    data exchange without compromising data privacy requirements (Census et al., 2019).
    Recently, some SI algorithms are also considered for SDN and cloud computing-based
    5G networks (Stévant et al., 2018) by forming service migration functions with
    privacy awareness. Other SI techniques such as ACO (Junnarkar et al., 2018) also
    facilitate the network authentication with bio-inspired algorithms embedded at
    the network controllers for securing communications and authenticating users with
    QoS preservation. Moreover, the potential of SI is also reflected in the attack
    detection tasks thanks to its learning and classification capability (Sharma and
    Kaul, 2018). The discussion in this section highlights the advantages of SI techniques
    in solving security issues in NGN and opens new opportunities for emerging SI-inspired
    security applications. The reviewed literature, used techniques, and highlights
    are summarized in Table 4. 6. SI for miscellaneous issues In this section, we
    survey the use of SI in miscellaneous yet important applications in 5G networks.
    6.1. UAV placement and path planning In this section, we discuss the benefits
    of SI approaches in the placement and path planning design of UAV in NGN. 6.1.1.
    UAV placement By relying on the underlying concept of self-organized behavior
    in nature, SI algorithms have proved their great potential in improving UAV-related
    communication designs, such as UAV placement. The work in Shakhatreh et al. (2017)
    presents a three-dimensional (3D) UAV placement framework for wireless coverage
    of the indoor environments in high-rise buildings under disaster situations, i.e.,
    earthquakes. To optimize the transmit energy consumed to cover the building, a
    PSO-based algorithm is designed that can find exactly the location of UAV under
    the random distributions of users. The 3D UAV placement for indoor users in small
    coverage areas is also considered in Sawalmeh et al. (2018) whose model can be
    used in wireless convergence for massively crowded events. Here, the UAV altitude
    placement is formulated with the objective of minimizing the transmission power
    and achieving the optimal altitude for both single UAV and multiple UAVs cases.
    Another UAV placement solution for massively crowded events is studied in Sawalmeh
    et al. (2017). UAVs can be used to provide wireless coverage for indoor and outdoor
    users by using the ground BSs. To specify the optimal 3D UAV placement, both Air-to-Ground
    and Outdoor-to-Indoor path loss models are employed to optimize the data rates
    of indoor and outdoor users under a UAV transmit power budget. Meanwhile, the
    research in Perabathini et al. (2019) focuses on the 3D UAV placement problem
    with QoS awareness in ad hoc wireless networks. The number of aerial BSs and transmit
    power of each station are jointly formulated and then solved by a PSO optimization
    algorithm in an iterative manner. The simulation results show a significant improvement
    of performance gain of the joint scheme that can provide an energy-efficient solution
    for 3D UAV placement of BSs in an ad hoc network. 6.1.2. UAV path planning A bio-inspired
    optimization learning environment can be built to simulate the UAV path-planning
    models (Duan et al., 2015), as shown in Fig. 5. Here, SI approaches such as ACO,
    PSO, and ABC are exploited to perform a student learning process for supporting
    the UAV path planner located at the ground control station. In this regard, by
    combining the control signals generated by SI algorithms and measurement and sensing
    parameters obtained from sensors, the UAV path planner can make an intelligent
    UAV path planning with optimal routing for transmit power minimization. Based
    on the statistical analytic results, SI-inspired algorithms show superior advantages
    in terms of strong robustness in comparison with directed-search approaches with
    simplicity of implementation and strong adaptability in different UAV path planning
    scenarios. An improved ACO-based UAV path planning architecture is proposed in
    Cekmez et al. (2016) with obstacles taken into account in a controlled area with
    several radars. To build a feasible path for UAVs, a traveling salesman problem
    is formulated via a tour construction of an ant that mimics the salesman routing
    in cities. To this end, a multi-colony ACO algorithm is built to solve the formulated
    path planning problem, showing a better performance than the classical ACO scheme.
    Moreover, the path planning issue for UAV swarms is also solved in Wang et al.
    (2019) where each UAV is regarded as an intelligent agent which performs searching
    its targets by updating the position and velocity in reconnaissance contexts.
    A distributed PSO model is taken to generate the optimal paths for UAVs for fast
    convergence and minimal latency for target detection. The work in Wai and Prasetia
    (2019) also employs a set-based PSO algorithm with adaptive weights to implement
    an optimal path planning scheme for a UAV surveillance system, aiming to minimize
    the energy consumption and improve the disturbance rejection response of UAVs.

    (2015). 6.2. Clustering and routing in IoT networks The clustering and routing
    problems have become mandatory for a variety of wireless IoT networks, for example,
    mobile/flying ad hoc networks, WSNs, and complex communication networks. SI has
    the potential to provide flexible and intelligent clustering and routing solutions
    for IoT networks. 6.2.1. Clustering in IoT networks Recently, some research efforts
    have been devoted to using SI techniques to solve clustering issues in wireless
    IoT networks. For example, the work in Osamy et al. (2020) suggests an SI-based
    clustering framework for wireless IoT sensor networks. The focus is on the energy
    efficiency improvement and energy usage balance through a fitness function that
    is optimized by a chicken swarm optimization algorithm. Meanwhile, a hierarchical
    clustering approach is proposed to implement the data clustering of the sanitized
    dataset in a fashion the confidential IoT data is kept while allowing to discover
    useful information (Lin et al., 2019). In this regard, a multi-objective PSO algorithm
    is adopted as a sensitization method to hide confidential information. Furthermore,
    to acquire a better positioning accuracy of the clustering tasks in location identification
    within MIMO sensor networks, a PSO algorithm is derived in Mukherjee et al. (2020)
    to optimize the cluster head in terms of reduction of calculation complexity and
    clustering decision convergence improvement. The authors in Nii et al. (2019)
    present a mobile sensing cluster using SI to create multiple swarms in mobile
    devices. This solution is promising to solve the turnaround searching latency
    issue caused by the single swarm configuration and creates new ways for dynamic
    multiple swarming for multiple sensing events in a given time. 6.2.2. Routing
    in IoT networks The work in Shreyas et al. (2020) implements an optimized routing
    model for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) where the main objective is laid
    towards communication performances in terms of packet delivery ratio and energy
    constraints. In particular, an ABC algorithm is employed to perform the selection
    of optimal routing between the source and destination IoMT nodes in order to improve
    both packet delivery ratio and energy usage. In terms of routing in vehicular
    networks, the authors in Bui and Jung (2019) apply an ACO scheme to enable a distributed
    intelligent traffic system for connected vehicles. Each vehicle can act as an
    intelligent agent to make routing decisions for minimizing waiting time in automated
    driving tasks. Besides, in wireless IoT sensor networks, how to perform flexible
    routing for traffic congestion control is highly important to enhance the QoS
    provisions regarding network lifetime and data packet drop ratio. The PSO-ML algorithm
    can be employed in these scenarios to optimize a fitness function by implementing
    a local searching using swarm particles and node discovery (Manshahia, 2018).
    The simulation results confirm a better routing performance than that in the ACO
    and ABC approaches. PSO is also applied in Al-Janabi and Al-Raweshidy (2018) for
    energy-efficient routing in IoT networks to facilitate the network scheduling
    to find the best routing for IoT nodes. Moreover, SI techniques such as PSO have
    been proven their potential in building intelligent routing solutions in vehicular
    ad hoc networks (VANETs). For example, a recent work in Bao et al. (2020) considers
    a clustering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) routing algorithm based on PSO to improve
    the V2V efficiency. This is enabled by the joint design of cluster creation, route
    particle coding, and routing in cluster or among vehicular clusters. The information
    of vehicles including position and velocity is collected to construct stable cluster
    and compute the fitness of the V2V links using a PSO algorithm. Another study
    in Husain et al. (2020) also suggests a PSO-based approach for optimizing geocast
    routing in VANETs. Due to its adaptability to the varying environment via observations
    and optimization, PSO is able to address diverse issues related to high mobility
    and the lack of scalability in dynamic VANETs. SI is also applied to facilitate
    routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). For example, the authors in Jamali
    et al. (2013) use PSO to build an energy-efficient routing protocol for MANETs,
    by taking both routing length and energy consumption into account. A routing issue
    as an optimization problem is formulated that is then solved by PSO to choose
    a route which maximizes a weighted function of the route length and the route
    energy level. PSO is also utilized in Chaudhry et al. (2018) to achieve a network
    lifetime maximization for geographical routing in MANETs. In this case, the network
    delay and energy consumption are minimized to increase the lifetime of the network.
    In addition, SI techniques are also envisioned to realize the optimal routing
    of satellite networks. Indeed, SI methods such as PSO can be employed for satellite
    position prediction (Durand and Abrão, 2017), which helps build intelligent systems
    to achieve several space missions such as attitude control, telemetry, and communication.
    Further, a power allocation scheme is built in Durand and Abrão (2017) by using
    PSO that can solve the problem of power usage minimization in the multiple narrow
    spotbeams for satellite networks, aiming to provide the minimum signal-to-noise
    plus interference ratio required by Earth station users to establish reliable
    satellite-ground communications. 6.3. Smart city applications SI techniques have
    been also applied to enable smart city applications. The work in Sato and Fukuyama
    (2017) presents a first attempt to use PSO optimization algorithms for a smart
    city in the context of smart communities. Here, both the power supply and power
    consumption models are taken into account where energy costs, actual electric
    power load at high load hours, and the amount of carbon dioxide emission are jointly
    optimized. The model is investigated at Toyama city, Japan, showing a performance
    enhancement in terms of lower energy consumption and emission, compared to other
    schemes like differential evolution. Another work pays attention to using SI for
    privacy guarantee in smart power systems in smart cities (Alamaniotis et al.,
    2016). In practice, the energy usage patterns of customers can be disclosed in
    the smart grid operations, i.e., energy consumption calculation process. Then,
    PSO can arrive as a solution to create group consumption patterns that can hide
    individual consumer characteristics for privacy preservation. SI has been used
    to support other smart city services such as vehicular networks. As an example,
    the work in Naseer and Jaber (2019) provides an SI-enabled solution for smart
    mobility and autonomous driving in smart cities with edge, fog, and cloud computing.
    Each vehicle can act as an intelligent agent in the SI algorithm that can estimate
    the traffic conditions and vehicle diversity for driving control and traffic routing.
    SI has been adopted in Duan (2018) to predict the traffic flow in smart cities.
    A PSO algorithm is essential to select the learning parameters in the support
    vector machine-based prediction model. In addition, to support the vehicular clustering
    process, a GWO technique is proposed in Fahad et al. (2017) where the number of
    vehicular clusters is optimized with respect to grid size, load balance factor,
    vehicle speed, and movement range. Since the algorithm is inhered from the social
    nature of gray wolves, the proposed scheme is able to explore better the searching
    space for finding the more concise optimal solution that is promising to achieve
    high vehicular routing performances in terms of reduced traffic delay and better
    network resource usage. Download : Download high-res image (672KB) Download :

    in smart grids (Dabhi and Pandya, 2020). 6.4. Energy management in smart gird
    In addition to the above use case domains, SI has been also useful in energy management
    for smart grid. For instance, to facilitate cost-efficient power management in
    multi-source renewable energy microgrids, a PSO algorithm is used in Keles et
    al. (2017). The key objective is to minimize the daily power cost of renewable
    microgrids, by finding the maximal energy mixing rate with PSO under energy balance
    and anti-islanding conditions. The implementation using PSO confirms a better
    energy efficiency along with the flexible adjustment of the mixing energy rate.
    The use of SI for energy management is also investigated in Rehman et al. (2016).
    Here, a binary PSO algorithm is developed to implement the home energy management
    scheduling by following the energy consumption patterns of customers in a fashion
    the total power cost is minimized while satisfying user comfort. A similar SI-based
    energy management model is studied in Wang et al. (2017) for energy storage systems
    in microgrids. The main goal is focused on improving the operational efficiency
    that can be achieved by using PSO with respect to power constraints and energy
    flow constraints. Recently, an SI-based framework is designed to solve the energy
    resource management problem in smart grids, by minimizing the total operational
    cost while maximizing the power system income (Dabhi and Pandya, 2020). As shown
    in Fig. 6, the energy aggregator enabled by SI optimization can perform efficient
    energy scheduling with respect to the uncertainty of energy sources such as solar
    energy, vehicles to grid, and electricity markets, in order to meet the various
    load demands. A testbed is also implemented using PSO that proves its efficiency
    in implementing the flexible energy consumption management for profit maximization
    with multiple energy demands. GWO is applied to enable efficient energy management
    in Moazzami et al. (2018). In this research, the planning and management of renewable
    energy sources with energy storage units are formulated that can be simulated
    by a GWO-based algorithm for reducing voltage deviation and pollution caused by
    grid operations. The operational planning for energy management is also studied
    in Sato and Fukuyama (2019) where a joint scheme of PSO and reinforcement learning
    is designed to optimize the energy consumption cost of small buildings without
    facility considerations. Table 5. Summary of the state-of-the-art SI techniques

    many other applications in NGN, including UAV placement and path planning, clustering
    and routing in IoT networks, smart city applications, and energy management in
    smart grid. Among SI algorithms, PSO has emerged as a prominent technique in different
    use case scenarios. SI algorithms have proved their great potential in improving
    UAV-related communication designs, such as UAV placement and path planning design
    (Shakhatreh et al., 2017, Duan et al., 2015, Cekmez et al., 2016). As an example,
    PSO can provide intelligent 3D UAV placement solutions for indoor users in small
    coverage areas that are promising for wireless convergence in massively crowded
    events. SI has also many applications, ranging from providing IoT sensor network
    clustering for energy efficiency improvement and energy usage balance (Osamy et
    al., 2020) to enabling optimized routing models for IoT ecosystems such as vehicular
    networks (Bui and Jung, 2019). Recently, SI has been used in smart city and smart
    grid domains, where bio-inspired algorithms such as PSO, ACO help realize intelligent
    services such as vehicular traffic prediction (Naseer and Jaber, 2019) and cost-efficient
    power management (Keles et al., 2017). The interesting findings from the use of
    SI techniques in these applications are expected to shed new light on future research
    for emerging SI-inspired 5G services. To summary this section, the reviewed literature,
    used techniques, and highlights are summarized in Table 5. 7. Research challenges
    and future directions In this section, we discuss some key research challenges
    and highlight possible directions on the use of SI in NGN. 7.1. Research challenges
    7.1.1. General challenges using SI methods In the preceding sections, the reason
    for the high applicability of SI methods is discussed. However, this does not
    mean that they are off-the-shelf optimizers, that is, we need to formulate the
    problem in a way that is suitable for the algorithm. The majority of SI methods
    require the designer to formulate the problem in a way to have all the parameters
    in a vector. This vector is used in the algorithm to optimize an objective function.
    Therefore, we need to provide an objective function to evaluate each vector combination
    that represents a potential solution for the problem. For instance, SI methods
    can be used as ML algorithms. In any learning algorithm, some parameters should
    be optimized to reduce the error rate. In this context, SI techniques can be employed
    to optimize the learning parameters. All the controlling parameters of the ML
    algorithm should be represented as a vector first (Mirjalili, 2015). In neural
    networks, for instance, the connection weights and biases can be used in a vector
    and the objective function is the error rate. Another challenge when solving real-world
    problems is the existence of multiple objectives. The objectives are typically
    in-conflict as well, so we have to find the best trade-offs between them. Therefore,
    there are no single solutions for problems with multiple objectives. A set called
    Pareto optimal solution is the answer for multi-objective problems (Mao-Guo et
    al., 2009). 7.1.2. Reduction in size of search space Since many optimization problems
    in NGN are defined over a large parameter search space, SI algorithms may have
    difficulties in finding high-quality solutions (close to global optima). Moreover,
    this issue becomes more challenging when the optimization problem involves both
    binary and continuous variables. One possible solution is to design prune policies
    to eliminate infeasible solutions and accelerate the optimization process (Huang
    et al., 2020). Another solution is to initialize high-quality solutions so that
    SI algorithms do not fall into the trap of local points. 7.1.3. Ability to find
    the globally optimum It is important to note that SI algorithms typically solve
    an optimization problem directly regardless of its convexity and optimality, i.e.,
    they are problem-independent. After reviewing many references, we observe a common
    mistake that the authors usually state that their SI-based algorithms would obtain
    the globally optimal solutions. For instance, it is written in Jiang et al. (2020)
    that the proposed hybrid algorithm can keep “the advantages of the PSO in finding
    globally optimal solutions”; however, it seems to be not correct. The fact that
    any SI approach maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation, and
    almost all SI algorithms are suitable for global optimization, but there is no
    guarantee for such optimality (Yang, 2014). Therefore, to evaluate the global
    optimality of an SI-inspired algorithm, one should conduct comparisons with other
    global optimization techniques like branch-and-bound and exhaustive search. From
    the learning perspective, improving the balance between exploration and exploitation
    would increase the possibility of achieving the global solution. For example,
    the work in Nguyen et al. (2021b) includes the properties of the binary search
    space and develops an adaptive strategy in designing a binary PSO algorithm. There
    are other difficulties when solving real-world problems using SI methods, including
    but not limited to, expensive objective function, discrete variables, binary variables,
    highly constrained problems, noisy objective functions, etc. There are different
    techniques to handle each of these areas. Covering all these challenges is outside
    the scope of this work. In sum, although SI has great potential for the design
    and optimization of NGN, many issues should be taken into consideration when SI-inspired
    algorithms are investigated for specific applications. 7.2. Future directions
    7.2.1. SI for solving large-scale optimization problems As the network will be
    very complex and heterogeneous, it is really difficult to optimize such systems
    by SI techniques with reasonable performance and fast convergence. Utilizing SI
    techniques for the design and optimization of large-scale IoT systems is challenging.
    A promising solution is dividing the entire network into smaller regions and region
    heads (e.g., edge server and macro BS) are responsible for coordination. Another
    solution is integration with SDN and NFV, which would gather and maintain global
    network state and information. The SI community has also developed various SI
    techniques for large-scale optimization. An example can be found in Lan et al.
    (2020) with a two-phase optimizer, which is motivated by the fact in real life
    that a smart leader can guide the team to have better achievements. These scalable
    techniques would improve the large-scale system performance in a comparison with
    conventional approaches. 7.2.2. Hybrid algorithms for performance improvement
    From the available literature, we observe that hybrid algorithms typically outperform
    the original algorithms if they are designed properly. For instance, Mandloi and
    Bhatia (2016) shows that the hybrid algorithm has better convergence speed and
    lower computational complexity than the original PSO and ACO methods. We note
    that hybrid methods can be designed in many ways, e.g., combining two or more
    basic SI techniques, adding chaotic operations, and controlling the balance between
    exploration and exploitation. Recently, many research works also consider integrating
    SI with DL techniques to accelerate and improve the solution. An example can be
    found in Nguyen and Lee (2020), where the initial solution for a metaheuristic
    is approximated by a deep neural network. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed
    approach with DL can obtain almost the same performance as the original method
    while reducing the computational complexity up to 85%. In sum, we expect that
    hybrid approaches, if designed properly, can improve the system performance significantly.
    7.2.3. SI for federated learning with applications to communication systems While
    SI algorithms are typically deployed in a centralized fashion, many emerging applications
    and services should be implemented distributedly. Moreover, security and data
    privacy are paramount aspects. In such a case, federated learning (Lim et al.,
    2020) is a promising concept as the training data does not need to be transmitted
    to and stored at the central server, that is, the model training can be completed
    while the training data is kept locally at users. Thanks to its particularities,
    federated learning has been recently found in many applications, especially ones
    at the edge networks like autonomous driving and medical services (Nguyen et al.,
    2021c). However, there are many challenges in deploying federated learning solutions
    such as resource allocation, communication security, and convergence guarantee
    for non-convex loss functions. To overcome these challenges, SI can be applied
    to find efficient solutions with competitive performance and convergence guarantee
    of FL, and a new concept, namely swarm federated learning, can be developed. 7.2.4.
    SI for 6G networks Studies on 6G have been already initialized by the research
    communities. Several technologies have been proposed as key enablers of 6G such
    as THz communications, spatial modulation, RIS, cell-free networks, 3D networking,
    blockchain, distributed AI (Dang et al., 2020, de Alwis et al., 2021). Moreover,
    many new use cases will be available, which shall include massive uRLLC and human-centric
    services. It is expected that AI will be the central theme for the design and
    optimization of 6G systems. As a branch of AI, SI shall find many applications
    in 6G. For example, for a very complex problem with many constraints and optimization
    variables, SI can be used as a tool to generate the initial dataset, which is
    then used by other DL techniques to train and improve the system. The combination
    of SI with DL and data analytics seems like an effective way to optimize 6G wireless
    systems. 8. Conclusion This survey has provided the fundamentals of SI and reviewed
    many potential applications of SI techniques to NGN. Firstly, we have presented
    an overview of SI and several well-known SI optimizers. Secondly, we have provided
    a state-of-the-art review on the applications of SI for emerging issues in NGN,
    including spectrum management and resource allocation, wireless caching and edge
    computing, network security, UAV placement and path planning, clustering and routing
    in IoT systems, smart city, and energy management in smart grid. We have discussed
    challenges for the use of SI techniques for NGN such as many general challenges,
    reduction in size of the search space, and ability to find the globally optimal
    solution. Such challenges are also open research questions for future works. Finally,
    we have presented promising research directions that can be investigated to efficiently
    solve technical problems in future wireless systems, including SI for large-scale
    networks, hybrid SI algorithms, swarm federated learning. We hope that this survey
    will serve as a starting reference for the applications of SI to NGN, and drive
    great ideas in the future. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

    Abstract: The rapid technological advancements in the current modern world bring\
    \ the attention of\nresearchers to fast and real-time healthcare and monitoring\
    \ systems. Smart healthcare is one of the\nbest choices for this purpose, in which\
    \ different on-body and off-body sensors and devices monitor\nand share patient\
    \ data with healthcare personnel and hospitals for quick and real-time decisions\n\
    about patients’ health. Cognitive radio (CR) can be very useful for effective\
    \ and smart healthcare\nsystems to send and receive patient’s health data by exploiting\
    \ the primary user’s (PU) spectrum.\nIn this paper, tree-based algorithms (TBAs)\
    \ of machine learning (ML) are investigated to evaluate\nspectrum sensing in CR-based\
    \ smart healthcare systems. The required data sets for TBAs are created\nbased\
    \ on the probability of detection (Pd) and probability of false alarm (P f ).\
    \ These data sets are\nused to train and test the system by using ﬁne tree, coarse\
    \ tree, ensemble boosted tree, medium\ntree, ensemble bagged tree, ensemble RUSBoosted\
    \ tree, and optimizable tree. Training and testing\naccuracies of all TBAs are\
    \ calculated for both simulated and theoretical data sets. The comparison\nof\
    \ training and testing accuracies of all classiﬁers is presented for the different\
    \ numbers of received\nsignal samples. Results depict that optimizable tree gives\
    \ the best accuracy results to evaluate the\nspectrum sensing with minimum classiﬁcation\
    \ error (MCE).\nKeywords: smart healthcare; spectrum sensing; optimizable tree;\
    \ machine learning; cognitive radio\n1. Introduction\nIn the current technologically\
    \ fast-paced world, people are facing many health-related\nissues and concerns.\
    \ Therefore, it is the need of time for quick and reliable healthcare and\nmonitoring\
    \ systems. Smart healthcare is one of the remedies to address health-related\n\
    issues and patient care remotely in real-time scenarios. Smart healthcare has\
    \ gained the\nattention of researchers and industries dramatically in recent years\
    \ [1–4]. Smart healthcare\ncan make it very easy and convenient for medical personnel\
    \ to share their information and\nsuggestions on real-time data of the patient’s\
    \ medical conditions and history in a short\ntime. The electroencephalogram (EEG)-driven\
    \ secure and reliable cognitive authentication\nsystem provides a solution to\
    \ ﬁx the security and privacy problems for an IoT-based\nhealthcare system [5].\
    \ The effectiveness of existing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) techniques\ncan be enhanced\
    \ by using a sensor-based remote patient monitoring (RPM) healthcare\nsystem [6].\
    \ The early detection of human health issues is very important for the better\n\
    provision of cures. Different sensors in the IoT-based health system collects\
    \ health-related\ndata for the early detection and real-time monitoring of human\
    \ health [7]. Cognitive\nradio (CR)-based smart healthcare is one of the most\
    \ popular and important research\nareas nowadays. Hybrid optical camera communication\
    \ (OCC) and Bluetooth low energy\n(BLE) are used to make an efﬁcient smart healthcare\
    \ system [8]. The system ensures that\npatients’ real-time electrocardiogram (ECG)\
    \ data are transmitted to a remote monitoring\nsystem in an efﬁcient way. The\
    \ smart healthcare system can also be beneﬁcial for providing\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7456. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177456\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7456\n2 of 19\nmaximum advantages of smart medicine to patients\
    \ at their door step by exploiting the CR\ntechnology. Smart medicine uses different\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques to process\nthe patient’s health data\
    \ on a micro level, even at the patient’s genetic level, and prescribes\nrelevant\
    \ treatments [9–11]. Cognitive sensors in CR-based smart healthcare continuously\n\
    sense the available spectrum to transmit and share the patients’ data with the\
    \ remotely\nplaced server via CR base station(s) or a fusion center. An architecture\
    \ of a CR-based smart\nhealthcare system can be visualized in Figure 1. Different\
    \ monitoring wireless sensors are\nattached to the human body. These sensors monitor\
    \ the human body parts for which they\nare placed and collect the real-time data\
    \ of the respective parts. These monitoring sensors\nare capable of performing\
    \ spectrum sensing. Once they ﬁnd a free spectrum, they share\ntheir collected\
    \ data with a remotely placed fusion center or data server. Other components\n\
    of the smart healthcare system, such as hospitals, ambulance services, pharmacies,\
    \ and\ndoctors’ clinics, are also equipped with CR technology and are connected\
    \ to the server.\nWhen the monitoring sensors on the human body share their data\
    \ with the server, these\ncomponents also receive those data simultaneously through\
    \ the server. Then, according to\nthe level of health condition based on the sensors’\
    \ data, the respective component of the\nCR-based smart healthcare system responds\
    \ to the patient and provides immediate and\nreal-time advice and precautions.\n\
    Figure 1. Cognitive radio-based smart healthcare system.\nThere has been signiﬁcant\
    \ growth in the consumption of wireless spectrum bands\nin the past couple of\
    \ decades. Cognitive radio (CR) has been under rigorous research\nto overcome\
    \ spectrum scarcity and underutilization [12]. Application areas of cognitive\n\
    radio can be smart healthcare systems, disaster relief, military and defense,\
    \ emergency\nscenarios, industry, transportation and communication, internet of\
    \ things (IoT), wireless\nbody area networks (WBANs), and many more [13–15]. The\
    \ throughput of the cognitive\nradio-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (CR-UAV)\
    \ is enhanced by jointly designing the\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n3 of 19\nUAV trajectory\
    \ and resource allocation [16]. High data rates and minimal end-to-end\nrouting\
    \ delays in CR-based IoT communication are achieved by using a reinforcement\n\
    learning (RL)-based routing approach [17]. The energy harvested communication\
    \ protocol\nis a good approach to optimize the throughput of the UAV-assisted\
    \ CR system [18]. A\nQ-learning-based dynamic spectrum access is considered in\
    \ three different access scenarios,\nsuch as orthogonal multiple access (OMA),\
    \ underlay spectrum access, and non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA), to utilize\
    \ the spectrum resources intelligently in the cognitive\nindustrial internet of\
    \ things (CIIoT) [19]. The fair and cooperative medium access control\n(FC-MAC)\
    \ protocol enhanced the performance efﬁciency of the heterogeneous CR-based\n\
    vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) [20,21].\nThe most important part of cognitive\
    \ radio technology is spectrum sensing. The role\nof this part is to sense the\
    \ spectrum and detect unused or free channels with the help of sec-\nondary users\
    \ (SUs). From its beginning, researchers have been researching the development\n\
    of different methods for spectrum sensing. Various methods have been proposed\
    \ by the\nresearchers. Energy detection, cyclostationary feature detection, and\
    \ matched ﬁlter [22] are\nthe most commonly used methods of spectrum sensing.\
    \ The probability of detection (Pd)\nand probability of false alarm (P f ) are\
    \ among the important parameters used in spectrum\nsensing. A high value of Pd\
    \ and lower value of P f are always required to avoid interference\nby SUs to\
    \ PUs. There exists a trade-off between the optimal sensing time and spectrum\n\
    hole utilization in cognitive radio networks [23]. A solution of an optimization\
    \ problem\nmaximizes the spectrum utilization efﬁciency of secondary users by\
    \ considering the dif-\nferent possible communication scenarios of SUs in CRN\
    \ [24]. Sampling controlled block\northogonal matching pursuit (SC-BOMP), schemes\
    \ of wideband compressive spectrum\nsensing (CSS) provided the high sensing accuracy\
    \ of CRNs in real time [25]. A convolu-\ntional neural network (CNN) obtained\
    \ high spectrum detection accuracy under different\nnoise models in CRN [26].\
    \ One of the main purposes of smart healthcare systems is to\nprovide health-related\
    \ facilities to people remotely. In smart healthcare systems, most of the\nmonitoring\
    \ devices and nodes share their data with remotely placed servers or physicians\n\
    through a wireless medium, but spectrum allocation for new wireless services and\
    \ applica-\ntions is a big challenge for authorities. Therefore, cognitive radio\
    \ technology can be used to\novercome this issue. Motivated by the fact of spectrum\
    \ scarcity and underutilization, we\npropose machine learning-based spectrum sensing\
    \ in CR-based smart healthcare systems\nfor the efﬁcient use of the primary or\
    \ existing spectrum for data sharing by secondary users\nwithout interfering with\
    \ the primary users. In this paper, tree-based algorithms (TBAs) of\nmachine learning\
    \ are used to evaluate the spectrum sensing. To the best of our knowledge,\nthese\
    \ algorithms are yet to consider evaluating spectrum sensing.\nThis work has the\
    \ following contributions:\n1.\nData set creation on simulated and theoretical\
    \ values of Pd and P f alarm.\n2.\nTree-based algorithms (TBAs), including ﬁne\
    \ tree, coarse tree, ensemble boosted tree,\nmedium tree, ensemble bagged tree,\
    \ ensemble RUSBoosted tree, and optimizable tree\nclassiﬁers, are used to classify\
    \ given data in MATLAB.\n3.\nThe evaluation of these classiﬁers’ performance measures\
    \ is presented based on the\ntraining and testing accuracies. This evaluation\
    \ is very helpful to obtain better results\nof spectrum sensing.\n4.\nMinimum\
    \ classiﬁcation error (MCE) of optimizable tree is also plotted and discussed\n\
    for both simulated and theoretical data sets.\nThe rest of the paper is composed\
    \ of the following sections: Section 2 consists of the\ndiscussions on different\
    \ works related to the involvement of machine learning/artificial\nintelligence\
    \ and cognitive radio technologies in smart healthcare applications. A system\n\
    model, discussing spectrum sensing and data sets creation for training and testing\
    \ the\nmodels, is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the simulation and\
    \ theoretical\nresults to evaluate the performance of all classifiers used in\
    \ this work. The paper\nconcludes with Section 5.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n4 of\

    Radio Technologies\nA smart healthcare system refers to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies, such as\nrobotics and IoTs, data analytics, and intelligent algorithms\
    \ of AI and ML, into the healthcare\nindustry to improve patient care, streamline\
    \ processes, and enhance overall efficiency of\nsystem. The efficient use of modern\
    \ technologies can make smart healthcare systems superior\nand robust over the\
    \ conventional healthcare systems. Smart healthcare systems can encompass\na wide\
    \ range of advanced technologies and concepts as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Advanced technologies as integral parts of smart healthcare system.\nData storage\
    \ and the management of patient health records collected by monitoring\ndevices\
    \ have signiﬁcant importance in an efﬁcient smart healthcare system. Healthcare\n\
    professionals can access patient health record through EHRs. EHRs ensure better\
    \ care\ncoordination between the patients and their physicians to reduce chances\
    \ of errors in the\ntreatment [27]. Telemedicine and remote monitoring in smart\
    \ healthcare system help pa-\ntients to consult and seek medical care advice from\
    \ their physicians remotely. Monitoring\ndevices regularly monitor health metrics\
    \ and send real-time data to physicians for proac-\ntive intervention [28,29].\
    \ Different wearable health monitoring devices in the IoT-based\nsmart healthcare\
    \ system collect data of patients’ health condition to provide personalized\n\
    healthcare recommendations [30,31]. Smart healthcare systems can offer clinical\
    \ decision\nsupport to healthcare professionals by providing evidence-based treatment\
    \ recommenda-\ntions and alerts about potential drug interactions or allergies.\
    \ Robotic technologies can\nassist in surgeries, medication dispensing, and other\
    \ medical tasks, enhancing precision\nand reducing the risk of human error [32].\
    \ Advanced data analytics and machine learning\ncan predict disease outbreaks,\
    \ patient needs, and trends. This helps healthcare providers\nto allocate resources\
    \ effectively and make informed decisions. AI-based algorithms can\nbe used to\
    \ process medical images for faster and more accurate diagnosis of cancer or\n\
    other diseases [33]. Mobile applications can encourage patient engagement by offering\n\
    tools for medication reminders, exercise tracking, and lifestyle management. These\
    \ ap-\nplications can also provide access to health information and educational\
    \ resources. As\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n5 of 19\nhealthcare systems become more\
    \ connected and reliant on data, robust security measures\nare essential to protect\
    \ patient privacy and sensitive medical information. Smart healthcare\nsystems\
    \ are integrated with emergency services to provide real-time location data and\n\
    medical information during emergencies, enabling faster and more effective responses.\n\
    Analytics can help hospitals and healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation,\
    \ such\nas staff scheduling and bed availability, leading to improved patient\
    \ ﬂow and reduced\nwait times [34]. Comprehensive patient care also requires that\
    \ different healthcare systems\nand devices can communicate and share data seamlessly\
    \ with each other.\nAn efﬁcient and successful smart healthcare system can be\
    \ designed by incorporating\nmachine learning and cognitive radio with it [35,36].\
    \ Smart healthcare devices and systems\nmust be spectral and energy efﬁcient while\
    \ they are assisted by cognitive radio [37,38].\nSpectrum utilization and energy\
    \ harvesting protocols can make WBANs more convenient\nand efﬁcient in smart healthcare\
    \ systems and applications [39]. A patient-centric hetero-\ngeneous smart healthcare\
    \ network predicts the patients’ health condition by employing\ndifferent machine\
    \ learning algorithms, including decision tree [40]. Data security and the\ntimely\
    \ evaluation of patients’ data in smart healthcare is the most important factor.\
    \ A novel\ndata encryption solution has made medical data transmission secure\
    \ between CR-based\ndevices and systems in a smart healthcare network [41]. 5G\
    \ and 6G technologies have\nhigh bandwidth and data rates; therefore, these technologies\
    \ can have a key role in the\ndevelopment of smart healthcare systems for the\
    \ betterment of humanity. A comprehensive\nreview on 5G and advanced technologies-based\
    \ smart healthcare solutions is given in [42].\nA very famous research area in\
    \ computer science is machine learning that aims to\ncreate algorithms and software\
    \ which can train and test the system for different data sets of\ninterest and\
    \ act intelligently while they are introduced to new information [43]. Machine\n\
    learning techniques and algorithms are also used widely in the development of\
    \ modern\ntechnologies, such as image processing, computer vision, speech recognition,\
    \ and object\n(face, text, posture, and people) detection in robotics [44,45].\
    \ Considering the effective\nuse of machine learning in other areas of science\
    \ and technology, the healthcare system\ncan also take advantages of ML to transform\
    \ conventional healthcare systems into smart\nhealthcare. The dream of smart healthcare\
    \ systems can become true by adapting ML and\nCR technologies in such a way that\
    \ sensing and monitoring devices in the healthcare system\ncan adapt their parameters\
    \ according to the dynamic radio conditions for real-time data\ntransmission and\
    \ processing. A deep learning (DL)-based convolutional neural network\n(CNN) model\
    \ showed good performance for detecting the movement of a fractured ankle\nafter\
    \ surgery [46]. Machine learning (ML) has been used extensively over the years\
    \ to\npredict and decide the spectrum availability in CRNs. In [47], the authors\
    \ used support\nvector machines (SVMs) for joint spectrum sensing and spectrum\
    \ allocation to network\ndynamics-aware IoT devices. The cost-effective and energy-efﬁcient\
    \ spectrum detection of\nreal-time signals in a CRN is performed by using SVM,\
    \ decision tree (DT) and KNN [48].\nDifferent ML and DL techniques and algorithms,\
    \ including decision trees, are used to\npredict human emotions that are positive,\
    \ neutral, or negative from the EEG signals [49].\nDecision tree classiﬁer with\
    \ other ML classiﬁers [50] are used for predicting the free spec-\ntrum. A decision\
    \ tree-based energy efﬁcient protocol has made it possible for decease\ndetection\
    \ in mobile healthcare network [51]. The efﬁciency of health-monitoring systems\n\
    can be increased by the privacy-preserving decision tree (PPDT) classiﬁcation\
    \ scheme [52].\nThree tree-based algorithms—random forest (RF), gradient boosting\
    \ (GB), and extra trees\n(ET)—are used to examine the importance of several aspects\
    \ of medical staff engagement\nin healthcare organizations [53]. A novel segment-based\
    \ cognitive radio vehicle ad hoc\nnetwork (CR-VANET) architecture can solve the\
    \ spectrum scarcity problem by using fuzzy\nand naïve Bayes algorithms [54]. KMeans,\
    \ AND and OR spectrum-sensing techniques are\nused to compare their performance\
    \ in CRNs [55]. Q-learning-based spectrum sensing adap-\ntively allocates the\
    \ multimedia data over multiple spectrum holes [56]. A decentralized\nRL resource\
    \ allocation scheme improves the spectrum utilization [57]. Ref. [58] provides\n\
    the solutions to different spectrum sensing challenges by using different supervised\
    \ and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n6 of 19\nunsupervised machine learning algorithms.\
    \ An intrusion of unauthorized data during co-\noperative spectrum sensing (CSS)\
    \ can be avoided by K-medoids and mean-shift data fusion\nmethods [59]. A comparison\
    \ of several machine learning techniques, including K-nearest\nneighbors, naive\
    \ Bayes, random forest, SVM, etc., for spectrum sensing is presented in [60].\n\
    3. System Model\nA working mechanism of cognitive radio in smart healthcare system\
    \ is shown in\nFigure 3. Different sensing and monitoring nodes are implanted\
    \ on the human body\nto monitor the health condition of different human body parts\
    \ and perform spectrum\nsensing in the designated time slot to share the monitored\
    \ data with other components\nof smart healthcare.\nFigure 3. Working mechanism\
    \ of cognitive radio in the smart healthcare system.\nEach sensing node has an\
    \ equal time frame (T), which is further divided into two time\nslots, i.e., sensing\
    \ (τs) and transmission (τtr) slots. In τs, the slot-sensing nodes perform the\n\
    spectrum sensing of the primary users and when it is declared that the spectrum\
    \ is free\nto use, they transmit their data to the CR base station or fusion center\
    \ in the τtr slot. On\nthe other hand, the CR base station communicates with other\
    \ components of the smart\nhealthcare system to share the data received from the\
    \ sensing nodes. The sensed data of\nsecondary users are classiﬁed by using tree-based\
    \ algorithms (TBAs), and the training and\ntesting accuracy of the spectrum sensing\
    \ is evaluated to decide whether the spectrum is\nfree to use or not. Assume a\
    \ centralized CR-based WBAN for a smart healthcare system\nwhich consists of M\
    \ wireless sensing nodes, hereinafter secondary users (SUs). A binary\nhypothesis\
    \ test can be applied to the received signal to perform the spectrum sensing by\n\
    the SUs, which is expressed as\ny(n) =\n(\nw(n)\nH0\ns(n) + w(n)\nH1,\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ s(n) represents the primary user’s signal with variance σ2\ns and w(n) represents\n\
    additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance σ2\nn. H0 and\
    \ H1\nrepresent the binary hypothesis of the absence and presence of PU, respectively.\
    \ There\nare several methods to perform spectrum sensing, but energy detection\
    \ is the most used\nmethod due to its simplicity and no requirement of prior knowledge\
    \ of the primary signal.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n7 of 19\nIn this paper, we also\
    \ consider the energy detection method. The process of the energy\ndetection-based\
    \ spectrum sensing is shown in Figure 4.\nReceived Signal\nEnergy Detection\n\
    Detection Threshhold\nDecision\nFigure 4. Spectrum sensing by using energy detection\
    \ method.\nProcess shows that SUs collects N number of samples of received signal\
    \ according\nto Equation (1) by continuously scanning the ambient environment.\
    \ After collecting the\nrequired number of samples, the average energy of these\
    \ received samples is calculated by\ntaking the square of the magnitude of each\
    \ sample and averaging the sum of all samples\nwith the total number of received\
    \ samples. A predeﬁned detection threshold needs to be\ncalculated, provided that\
    \ a high target detection probability will be achieved. The average\nenergy of\
    \ the received samples is then compared with a predeﬁned detection threshold.\
    \ In\nthe last step, the decision is made based on the comparison results of the\
    \ average energy of\nthe signal and detection threshold. If the average energy\
    \ becomes greater than the detection\nthreshold, it is decided that the primary\
    \ user is present in the sensed spectrum; otherwise,\nthe spectrum is declared\
    \ free to use for SUs. The average energy of the received samples of\nthe primary\
    \ signal is known as test statistic T , which is used to compare with the detection\n\
    threshold. T can be expressed as\nT = 1\nN\nN\n∑\nn=1\n|y(n)|2.\n(2)\nProbabilities\
    \ of detection (Pd) and false alarm (P f ) are two important parameters\nassociated\
    \ with spectrum sensing and also show the performance of CRNs. For an efﬁcient\n\
    CRN, high (Pd) and low (P f ) are always required. (Pd) actually gives us the\
    \ probability\nof the presence of PU in the given spectrum and (P f ) gives the\
    \ wrong probability of the\npresence of PU in the given spectrum. Therefore, high\
    \ (Pd) is always required so that PUs\ncannot be interfered by SUs. On the other\
    \ hand, (P f ) is a missed opportunity to use the\nfree spectrum, and therefore,\
    \ low (P f ) is needed for efﬁcient CRNs. (Pd) and (P f ) are\nnormally calculated\
    \ by comparing T with the predeﬁned detection threshold λ given that\nprimary\
    \ users are available or not in the spectrum. Pd and P f in terms of T and λ can\
    \ be\ndeﬁned as [61]\nPd = Pr(T > λ|H1),\n(3)\nP f = Pr(T > λ|H0)\n(4)\nThe test\
    \ statistic T has chi-square under hypothesis H0 and non-central chi-square\n\
    distributions under H1, with N degrees of freedom. It is assumed that each SU\
    \ collects a\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n8 of 19\nlarge number of samples (N ); therefore,\
    \ according to the central limit theorem, the PDF of\ny(n) denoted as f(y) can\
    \ be considered to be a Gaussian distribution and is given as [61]\nf(y) =\n(\n\
    N(σ2\nn, σ4n\nN )\nH0\nN((γ + 1)σ2\nn, (2γ+1)σ2n\nN\n)\nH1,\n(5)\nwhere γ expresses\
    \ the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The process of spectrum sensing starts\nby\
    \ converting the received signal into N number of samples according to the requirement.\n\
    (Pd) and (P f ) depend on N . A higher value of N guarantees higher (Pd) and lower\n\
    (P f ). So, (Pd) and (P f ) can be expressed as follows [23]:\nPd = Q\n\x12\x10\
    \ λ\nσ2n\n− γ − 1\n\x11s\nN\n2γ + 1\n\x13\n,\n(6)\nP f = Q\n\x12\x10 λ\nσ2n\n\
    − 1\n\x11√\nN\n\x13\n,\n(7)\nwhere Q(·) is known as the Q-function, which is deﬁned\
    \ by\nQ(x) =\n1\n√\n2π\nZ ∞\nx\nexp\n\x10\n− v2\n2\n\x11\ndv.\n(8)\nIn spectrum\
    \ sensing, a higher target detection probability ( ¯Pd) is assumed such that\n\
    there are fewer chances of missed detections of the presence of PU. The missed\
    \ detection\nof the presence of PU causes interference with PU communication,\
    \ which is undesirable\nin CRNs. Therefore, ¯Pd can be used to obtain such a value\
    \ of λ, which can be helpful to\nachieve higher (Pd) and lower (P f ):\nλ = σ2\n\
    n\n\x10\nγ + 1 +\nr\n2γ + 1\nN\nQ−1( ¯Pd)\n\x11\n.\n(9)\nTherefore, P f related\
    \ to ¯Pd can be computed as [23]\nP f = Q\n\x10p\n2γ + 1Q−1( ¯Pd) + γ\n√\nN\n\x11\
    \n.\n(10)\nOnce the sensing results in the form of Pd and P f are obtained, the\
    \ above-mentioned\ntree-based algorithms are used to train and test the model\
    \ to evaluate the spectrum sensing\nin the CR-based smart healthcare system. The\
    \ ﬂow diagram of the proposed system to\nevaluate the spectrum sensing for both\
    \ theoretical and simulated data is shown in Figure 5.\nIn the given ﬂow diagram,\
    \ the energy detection block shows that a complete energy\ndetection process as\
    \ discussed earlier is applied to the received signal to compare the\naverage\
    \ energy of received signal samples with a pre-deﬁned detection threshold. Based\n\
    on the comparison results in the ﬁrst block, the probabilities of detection and\
    \ false alarm\nare calculated in the next block. The ﬁrst two blocks show the\
    \ conventional method of\nthe spectrum-sensing process. Onward, these block applications\
    \ of ML begin on the data.\nFirst, the values of Pd and P f are labeled with ‘1’\
    \ and ‘0’, respectively. The labeled values\nof Pd and P f are then fed to the\
    \ data set creation block to create a data set of the two\nprobabilities. In the\
    \ data-training block, the model is trained for 70% of the values of the\ndata\
    \ set. After training the model, the remaining 30% of the data set is used to\
    \ test the\nmodel. The results of the spectrum evaluation in the form of training\
    \ and testing accuracies\nof tree-based algorithms (TBAs) are gathered after training\
    \ and testing the model with\nthose TBAs. A theoretical data set is created by\
    \ using the numerical expressions of energy\ndetection, Pd and P f , while the\
    \ simulated data set is created by simulating the Pd and\nP f . Simulation is\
    \ performed by comparing the average energy of randomly generated\nsignal samples\
    \ with a predeﬁned detection threshold. Theoretical and simulated data\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7456\n9 of 19\nsets now consist of theoretical and simulated labeled\
    \ Pd and P f , respectively. Fine tree,\nmedium tree, coarse tree [62], boosted\
    \ tree [63], bagged tree [64], RUSBoosted tree [65,66],\nand optimizable tree\
    \ [67]algorithms are used for classiﬁcation. Tree base algorithms are\neasy to\
    \ translate, fast to predict, and low in memory usage. Optimizable tree classiﬁcation\n\
    performs hyperparameter tuning by default using Bayesian optimization [68]. Training\n\
    and testing accuracies of all algorithms are taken at the end to evaluate the\
    \ spectrum\nsensing. Fine tree, medium tree, coarse tree and optimizable tree\
    \ are types of decision\ntree (DT) classiﬁers of ML. DT is considered a nonparametric\
    \ supervised ML algorithm\nwhich splits the input data (root node) into further\
    \ sub data points known as branches,\ninternal nodes and leaf nodes. The splitting\
    \ of data in this way creates a tree-like shape\nwhich has roots, branches and\
    \ leaves. DT learning uses the divide-and-conquer strategy\nto ﬁnd the optimal\
    \ splitting points in the input data by performing a greedy search. The\nworking\
    \ mechanisms of ﬁne tree, medium tree, coarse tree, and optimizable tree are slightly\n\
    different from each other. The main difference of these classiﬁers is the complexity\
    \ of the\ntree they create by using different numbers of splits. The maximum numbers\
    \ of splits for\nﬁne tree, medium tree, coarse tree, and optimizable tree are\
    \ 100, 20, 4, and 2, respectively.\nAll these classiﬁers employ the Gini diversity\
    \ index to evaluate the accuracy of splits for\nrandom data points. Boosted tree,\
    \ bagged tree, and RUSBoosted tree are types of ensemble\nML methods. Ensemble\
    \ learning combines the multiple decision tree algorithms, which\nshow weak behavior\
    \ in the classiﬁcation of input data. All these classiﬁers use the decision\n\
    tree learner with different numbers of splits. Boosted tree, bagged tree, and\
    \ RUSBoosted\ntree have 20, 199, and 20 maximum number of splits, respectively.\n\

    10 of 19\n4. Results and Discussion\nIn this section, the Matlab simulation results\
    \ are provided to evaluate the performance\nof the proposed system. The necessary\
    \ parameters to perform the spectrum sensing and\nto obtain the theoretical and\
    \ simulated values of Pd and P f are set as fs = 6 MHz, target\ndetection probability\
    \ ( ¯Pd) = 0.9, and SNR (γ) = −15 dB. The analysis of the classiﬁcation\nlearning\
    \ tool in Matlab [69] is used to perform spectrum-sensing data evaluation.In Matlab,\n\
    we create an environment by generating the samples of random noise and primary\
    \ signal.\nIn total, 1000 Monte Carlo simulations are performed to generate noise\
    \ and primary signal\nseparately. In each simulation, the average energy of received\
    \ signal is calculated for both\nnoise only and noise + primary signal. The average\
    \ energy of both scenarios is compared\nwith the predeﬁned energy detection threshold.\
    \ After 1000 simulations, the number of\ntimes that the average energy is greater\
    \ than the threshold under the hypothesis H0 (only\nnoise)) is divided by the\
    \ total number of simulations, and the result is considered P f . In\nthis way,\
    \ 200 values of P f are calculated. Similarly, Pd is calculated by dividing the\
    \ number\nof times that the average energy is greater than the threshold under\
    \ the hypothesis H1\n(noise + primary signal) with the total number of simulations.\
    \ In this way, the simulated\nvalues of Pd and P f are calculated. Theoretical\
    \ values of both probabilities are calculated\nby using their mathematical expressions,\
    \ which are described in the relevant section.\n4.1. Data Modeling\nThere are\
    \ two different data sets created from the spectrum-sensing process. Both\nsimulated\
    \ and theoretical values of the probability of detection (Pd) and probability\
    \ of\nfalse alarm P f are passed through the labeling process. Values of Pd are\
    \ labeled with ‘1’,\nwhile the values of (P f ) are labeled with ‘0’, respectively,\
    \ to create the two data sets of both\nsimulated and theoretical probabilities.\
    \ The default value of cross validation is set as 5. In\ntotal, 70% of the data\
    \ of both the simulated and theoretical data sets is used to train the\nclassiﬁers,\
    \ while the remaining 30% is used for testing purposes.\n4.2. Results of Classiﬁers\n\
    After training and testing in the classification learner, all tree-based models\
    \ are compared\nto evaluate their performance in terms of training (validation)\
    \ and testing accuracy. A com-\nparison of the training and testing accuracies\
    \ of different tree-based classifiers for simulated\ndata for 1000, 1500, 2000,\
    \ and 2500 samples of the received signal is shown in Table 1.\nThe results in\
    \ the table show that the training and testing accuracies of all classiﬁers\n\
    increase with the increase in the number of received signal samples. This is because\n\
    when the number of samples increases, the sensing results also change in the form\
    \ of (Pd)\nand (P f ). The higher number of samples provides high (Pd) and low\
    \ (P f ), which are\nactually the desired results expected from efﬁcient spectrum\
    \ sensing. So when the high\n(Pd) and low (P f ) are labeled with ‘1’ and ‘0’\
    \ respectively, it provides more 1s than 0s\nin the data set. Therefore, classiﬁers\
    \ are trained with the data set which has a maximum\nnumber of the same labels,\
    \ i.e., 1s, and as a result this provides high training and testing\naccuracies.\
    \ Among all classiﬁers, optimizable tree provides better training and testing\n\
    accuracies for each given number of the received signal’s samples. The training\
    \ and testing\naccuracies of optimizable tree are 89.30% and 86.70% for 1000 samples,\
    \ 92.90% and 91.70%\nfor 1500 samples, 96.40% and 96.70% for 2000 samples, and\
    \ 98.60% and 96.70% for 2500\nsamples, respectively.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n\

    \ Error (MCE)\nThe goal of the MCE plot is to reduce the resulting classiﬁcation\
    \ error when attempting\nto classify a new information set. Usually, these classiﬁcations\
    \ use some structure of the\nstatistical model to describe the information. The\
    \ x label shows the number of iterations,\nand the y label shows the minimum classiﬁcation\
    \ error. The minimum classiﬁcation error\nhas the following details [69]:\n•\n\
    Estimated minimum classiﬁcation error: Each blue element corresponds to the sub-\n\
    division error estimate combined with the optimization process when taking into\n\
    account all the parameter value units. Estimation is primarily based on the high\n\
    self-assurance of the current goal model of the divisions.\n•\nMinimum error of\
    \ classiﬁcation: Each circle corresponds to a ﬁxed-phase calculation\nerror that\
    \ is combined over a long distance using a ﬁne-tuning process.\n•\nHyperparameter\
    \ point: The rectangle shows the generation corresponding to the best\npoint hyperparameters.\n\
    •\nError of hyperparameters. The feature indicates an error in the classiﬁcation\
    \ phase.\nFigures 6 and 7 show the minimum classiﬁcation error (MCE) plot of the\
    \ optimizable\ntree of both the simulated and theoretical data sets for 1000 and\
    \ 2500 numbers of received\nsignal samples, respectively. Four different MCE values,\
    \ i.e., estimated minimum classi-\nﬁcation error, observed minimum classiﬁcation\
    \ error, best point hyperparameters, and\nminimum error hyperparameters, are shown\
    \ in each MCE plot. Figure 6a shows the graph\nof the MCE plot of simulated data\
    \ for 1000 samples, with the minimum classiﬁcation error\nshown on the y-axis\
    \ and number of iterations on the x-axis. The estimated MCE value\nis 0.164 at\
    \ the start and becomes constant at 0.108 after the 6th iteration. The observed\n\
    MCE also starts from 0.164 and becomes constant at 0.108 after the 6th iteration.\
    \ Both\nestimated and observed MCEs are almost completely overlapped with each\
    \ other, except\nfor the estimated MCE value of 0.117 at the 5th iteration, which\
    \ shows the success of the\nclassiﬁcation process of optimizable tree. The best\
    \ point hyperparameters and minimum\nerror hyperparameters are 0.108 at the 5th\
    \ iteration, which shows that the optimization of\nthe hyperparameter point in\
    \ the hyperparameter search range exhibits less error to enhance\nthe performance\
    \ of the learning process for optimizable tree. Similarly, in Figure 6b, the\n\

    \ when the number of\nSensors 2023, 23, 7456\n15 of 19\nsamples increases, Pd\
    \ touches the highest value of 1 and P f goes down almost equal to\n0. This results\
    \ in better spectrum sensing, and the classifier obtains the true value of the\n\
    presence of PU, and as a result, it gives higher accuracy values and fewer classification\n\
    errors. It is also observed from the MCE plots of both simulated and theoretical\
    \ data\nsets that the number of samples has a prominent influence on MCE. When\
    \ the number\nof samples increases, the MCE parameters exhibit lower values, which\
    \ shows that the\noptimizable tree performance increases from the lower to higher\
    \ number of samples.\nBoth simulated and theoretical MCE plots show close similarity\
    \ in the values.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart healthcare is one of the hot research\
    \ topics by researchers nowadays, for which\ndifferent on-body and off-body sensors\
    \ and devices monitor and share patients’ data\nwith healthcare personnel and\
    \ hospitals for quick and on-time decisions about patient\nhealth. The smart healthcare\
    \ system has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery,\nmaking it more\
    \ personalized, efﬁcient, and accessible while improving patient outcomes\nand\
    \ the overall quality of care. However, it also requires careful implementation,\
    \ the\nconsideration of ethical concerns, and continuous monitoring to ensure\
    \ its effectiveness\nand security. Cognitive radio (CR) is meant to solve the\
    \ problem of spectrum scarcity\nfor different wireless services and applications.\
    \ CR technology can be useful for smart\nhealthcare systems to send and receive\
    \ the monitoring data through the PU spectrum\nwithout interfering with the PU\
    \ communication. CR-based smart healthcare resolves\ntwo main issues: First, it\
    \ allows monitoring sensors (secondary users) to transmit data\nwirelessly when\
    \ the primary user is inactive in the spectrum according to the spectrum\nsensing\
    \ results. Second, it improves the use of spectrum utilization efﬁciency. In this\n\
    paper, tree-based algorithms (TBAs) are used to evaluate the spectrum sensing\
    \ efﬁciently.\nThe energy detection method is used to decide the availability\
    \ of the spectrum of interest.\nData sets are created based on simulated and theoretical\
    \ values of Pd and P f . Different\nclassiﬁers of machine learning like ﬁne tree,\
    \ coarse tree, ensemble boosted tree, medium\ntree, ensemble bagged tree, ensemble\
    \ RUSBoosted tree, and optimizable tree are used\nto calculate the training and\
    \ testing accuracy-based sensing results. Comparisons of all\nsaid classiﬁers\
    \ are made for both the simulated and theoretical results of Pd and P f . The\n\
    investigation of all classiﬁers for the various number of samples is performed\
    \ in terms of the\ntraining and testing accuracies and the minimum classiﬁcation\
    \ error (MCE) to compare the\neffectiveness of the proposed work for the better\
    \ evaluation of spectrum sensing. Among\nall classiﬁers, optimizable tree provides\
    \ better training and testing accuracies for each given\nnumber of the received\
    \ signal’s samples. The training and testing accuracies of optimizable\ntree are\
    \ 89.30% and 86.70% for 1000 samples, 92.90% and 91.70% for 1500 samples, 96.40%\n\
    and 96.70% for 2000 samples, and 98.60% and 96.70% for 2500 samples, respectively.\

    \ Poland, 5–8 October 2020.\nAbstract: The problem of waveform construction for\
    \ mobile ad hoc networks with cognitive radio\n(MANET-CR) is discussed. This is\
    \ the main limitation to widely use this very attractive technique,\nwhich does\
    \ not need the deployment of expensive communication infrastructure. Two main\
    \ questions\ncorrespond to MANET-CR effectiveness: spectrum sensing and spectrum\
    \ sharing. The paper presents\nthe structure of CR nodes that enables Opportunistic\
    \ Spectrum Sharing. Procedures for advanced\nDynamic Spectrum Management together\
    \ with the concept of policy-based radio and a sensing\nmethod are presented.\
    \ In the proposed system, the basic policy is to avoid interference generated\
    \ by\nother users or jammers. The experiments were performed in a real environment,\
    \ using the elaborated\ntestbed. The results show that the use of sensing and\
    \ cognitive management mechanisms enable\nmore efﬁcient use of the spectrum while\
    \ maintaining reasonable overhead values related to the\nmanagement procedures.\n\
    Keywords: dynamic spectrum management; spectrum sensing; cognitive radio; waveform;\
    \ ad hoc\nnetwork testbed\n1. Introduction\nMobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) are\
    \ gaining growing interest because they enable\ncommunication between radio nodes\
    \ without infrastructure. This technology is used in\nthe case of systems consisting\
    \ of a variety of network elements such as wireless nodes\nincluding vehicular,\
    \ personal, and temporary ﬁxed (but nomadic) platforms, as well as\nwireless sensors.\
    \ All these nodes create a robust and reliable network of networks. Such an\n\
    approach is widely used in military and governmental systems and may be used in\
    \ future\n5G systems working in device-to-device mode.\nThe main goal of this\
    \ paper is to present the developed MANET cognitive waveform\nwith spectral agility,\
    \ enabling mitigation of interferences, improvement of network reliabil-\nity,\
    \ and throughput. The waveform is implemented in a real-time demonstrator to enable\n\
    its validation in a real spectral environment.\nSpectrum scarcity is a basic limitation\
    \ for the extensive use of such networks that are\nthe area of interest for both\
    \ military and civilian applications. Limited spectral resources\nenforce the\
    \ use of complex dynamic spectrum management procedures in which Cognitive\nRadio\
    \ (CR) is the most promising solution.\nCognitive radio is deﬁned as an intelligent\
    \ radio, which is based on Software Deﬁned\nRadio (SDR) technology that is aware\
    \ of its electromagnetic environment and can react\nto input stimuli to perform\
    \ a reliable communication system and maximize spectrum\nutilization [1]. The\
    \ main issue in commercial radio systems is increasing user demand for\nthroughput\
    \ related to a scarcity of available spectrum resources. For this reason, dynamic\n\
    spectrum access mechanisms [2–4] are strongly developed. Military communication\
    \ as\ntactical radio networks, in addition to these issues, must deal with intentional\
    \ jamming\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041052\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 1052\n2 of 21\nand interferences. In this case, different types\
    \ of jammers are used. These are classiﬁed\nin [5]. The most widely known types\
    \ of jammers are spot and barrage jammers. The ﬁrst\none attacks a speciﬁc frequency\
    \ and the second one jams a range of frequencies.\nThe most popular cognitive\
    \ technique to mitigate jamming for small mobile platforms\nwith a single antenna\
    \ is the change in the transmission channel based on spectrum sensing\nresults.\n\
    Conventional transmission techniques, e.g., Frequency Hopping (FH) [6] or Direct\n\
    Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) [7,8], are used to counteract jamming, but without\
    \ spec-\ntrum monitoring, any devices using these techniques are not aware of\
    \ available alternative\nresources.\nRecently, Internet of Things (IoT) devices\
    \ operating in the ISM 2.4 GHz and 900 MHz\nbands are gaining popularity, which\
    \ may pose a threat to the free spectrum access. Addi-\ntionally, in the 2.4 GHz\
    \ band, it is necessary to share spectral resources with numerous\ndevices transmitting\
    \ under the 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard. In most cases, IoT devices transmit\ndata\
    \ using the 802.15.4 standard, which is dedicated to use Carrier Sense Multiple\
    \ Ac-\ncess with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), which prevents collisions with\
    \ other devices.\nHowever, it does not solve the problem of hidden nodes and can\
    \ introduce delays in the\ncase of too many interferences. In 2012, an additional\
    \ Time Slotted Channel Hopping\n(TSCH) [9] mode was introduced as an amendment\
    \ (802.15.4e) to the Medium Access\nControl (MAC) of IEEE 802.15.4. In this mode,\
    \ access to the medium is organized using\nTime Division Multiple Access (TDMA)\
    \ and the Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum\n(FHSS). This allows us to increase\
    \ the efﬁciency of the transmitted data and reduce the\nimpact of fast-fading\
    \ effects on the quality of transmission. In the TSCH, nodes transmit\ndata in\
    \ each time slot, and the center frequency changes them. To avoid interferences\
    \ from\nother systems, this mode provides a list of forbidden channels (blacklist)\
    \ for which the\nQuality of Service (QOS) may be unacceptable. Unfortunately,\
    \ the standard does not deﬁne\nhow to build this list in speciﬁc cases and currently\
    \ it is an open issue [10].\nOn the other hand, in the case of a cluster-based\
    \ MANET with FH, it requires orthogo-\nnal codes and sequence modiﬁcation to assure\
    \ no interferences take place between clusters.\nThis increases the complexity\
    \ of the system and may also lead to collisions. Other issues\nrelated to MANET\
    \ are continuous interferences that can jam the trafﬁc that controls in the\n\
    network. Nodes do not recognize if it is a temporary interference and should stay\
    \ at the\njammed channel for some time, or whether it is intentional interference,\
    \ and they should\nstart the procedure of searching for a new free channel. As\
    \ a result, new synchronization in\nthe network must be performed.\nTo ensure\
    \ effective spectrum access, without collision with other radio systems, it is\n\
    important to have precise and instantaneous knowledge about spectrum usage. Since\
    \ the\nurban environment is very diverse, and, in some cases, signals can be detected\
    \ in one place\nonly to disappear a few meters away, cooperative sensing [11]\
    \ seems to be a good solution\nfor overcoming these issues [12].\nThere are two\
    \ main approaches in cooperative sensing: wideband and narrowband\nsensing. Wideband\
    \ sensing allows us to analyze signals in larger numbers of adjacent chan-\nnels\
    \ at one time, while narrowband sensing allows detection of narrowband signals\
    \ [13].\nThe commonly used energy detector is easy to implement and introduces\
    \ few delays, but it\ndoes not handle signals with low signal-to-noise ratios\
    \ well. Cooperative sensing increases\nthe probability of detection in this case.\n\
    Cooperative sensing can be performed with soft or hard decision making. In the\n\
    case of the ﬁrst one, signal samples are sent to main nodes from every cooperative\
    \ node.\nThis improves the decision algorithm but decreases the throughput in\
    \ the network for\nuser services. A compressive sensing approach [14] can be used\
    \ to overcome these limits.\nHowever, these methods can be computationally complex\
    \ and require high sampling rates\nand high-resolution analog-to-digital converters.\
    \ In the hard decision method, only sensing\nresults (free or busy channel) are\
    \ sent to main nodes. A disadvantage of this method is the\nlack of knowledge\
    \ about the percentage channel occupancy.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052\n3 of 21\nThis\
    \ paper addresses the question of what communications and networking technol-\n\
    ogy can be used to fully realize data exchange by handheld radios in a complex\
    \ radio-\nenvironment in the battleﬁeld. It is an extension of work described\
    \ in [15]. The concept\nof the waveform, which can prevent intentional jamming\
    \ and interferences from other\nsystems, has been demonstrated. This solution\
    \ is based on a cognitive radio network\nwith cooperative sensing, where all nodes\
    \ in the network detect interferences in backup\nchannels and send results to\
    \ the main node in a cluster. The main node, based on these\ndata, sets a list\
    \ of the available backup channels for the cluster. The demonstrated im-\nplementation\
    \ of this waveform consists of a cognitive plane and a Basic Waveform (BW)\nplane.\
    \ BW is based on techniques currently used for MANET solutions corresponding to\n\
    the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation [16] in the physical\n\
    layer and 802.15.4 [17] standard for the MAC layer.\nOur main contributions are:\n\
    •\nadaptation of 802.15.4 MAC frames for cognitive spectrum management,\n•\nproposition\
    \ of multi-channel sensing for devices with one radio frequency interface,\n•\n\
    best channel selection method for optimal spectrum access,\n•\ncreation of a testbed\
    \ for MANET waveform development.\nSection 2 presents the global characterization\
    \ of the CR waveform construction for\nMANET. Proposed sensing methods are presented\
    \ in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the\narchitecture of the implemented cognitive\
    \ waveform on the SDR platform. In Section 5,\nthe authors describe the elaborated\
    \ radio network testbed. Results are shown in Section 6,\nwhile Section 7 presents\
    \ the conclusion and future work.\n2. CR Waveform Construction\n2.1. The Key Challenge\
    \ of CR MANET Implementation\nTwo main questions correspond to CR MANET implementation.\
    \ The ﬁrst one is\nhow to recognize spectrum occupancy and to decide if the frequency\
    \ channel is free\nor not. The sensing process should be accurate in terms of\
    \ the minimal signal level\ndetection and occupancy decision probability and should\
    \ rapidly monitor the possible\nwide spectrum band.\nThe second question concerns\
    \ the network organization and used procedures. Here,\nthe following issues are\
    \ the main key challenge for CR MANET implementation:\n•\nDynamically discover,\
    \ authenticate, and connect\n•\nAutoconﬁguration capabilities with self-organizing\
    \ mechanisms\n•\nRouting exchange compression\n•\nMAC protocols\n•\nNetwork recovery\n\
    •\nSecurity and vulnerability\n2.2. State of the Art Analysis of CR Waveform Implementation\n\
    Below, a short overview of recent work achieved in mentioned challenges is presented.\n\
    It can be stated that references discuss mostly some questions concerning CR MANET\n\
    that could be used for communication supporting highly dynamic military operations,\n\
    where the heterogenous networking system is used (Figure 1), including Wireless\
    \ Sensors\nNetworks (WSN).\nMilitary MANET must meet four general requirements\
    \ [18]: Strong Connectivity, Very\nHigh Bandwidth, Effective Security, and Survivability.\
    \ Such a heterogenous network is\ncreated as a set of clusters with homogeneous\
    \ nodes. The hierarchical management process\nis used in cluster topology (Figure\
    \ 2).\nSuch a network includes three types of nodes: Cluster Head (CH), which\
    \ is responsible\nfor resource management within the cluster, Gateway (GW), which\
    \ provides communi-\ncation between neighboring clusters, and Regular Node (RN).\
    \ Each of them uses one\nspectrum resource, other than the neighboring one. This\
    \ phenomenon corresponds to the\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052\n4 of 21\ncluster coloring.\
    \ Each node can be used as a gateway in multihop transmission between\nclusters.\n\

    \ the authors present\nthe concept of the Weighted Clusterhead Node Election algorithm\
    \ (WCNE) in a MANET.\nIn the algorithm, a CH set is chosen that minimizes the\

    \ the probability of delivering information to\nthe sink. The speciﬁc weight components\
    \ are related to the mobility, battery level, and\nreceived signal-to-noise power\
    \ ratio for each node. Furthermore, energy limitation is also\ndiscussed in [18].\
    \ Here, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol\nand Stable\
    \ Election Protocol (SEP) are compared and the authors propose Advanced SEP\n\
    to improve the lifetime of sensors in MANET. Energy efﬁciency is also the main\
    \ objective\ndiscussed in [16] for OFDM systems, where lifetime and reliability\
    \ are the main criteria\nfor WSN due to the limitation of energy sources. These\
    \ questions are reviewed widely\nin [20,21].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052\n5 of 21\n\
    Due to the network mobility, its structure is variable, and it should be adapted\
    \ ac-\ncording to the results of neighbors’ discovery. For this purpose, HELLO\
    \ messages are\nused, and they can be modiﬁed to enable adaptive network reconﬁguration.\
    \ An enhanced\nsuperframe structure for real time data transmission is proposed\
    \ in [22] for networks based\non the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. This standard is\
    \ suggested in [17] for Dynamic Spectrum\nAccess (DSA) in SDR-based networks.\
    \ Issues concerning modelling and optimization of\nthe IEEE 802.15.4 protocol\
    \ for reliable and timely communications are described in [23],\nand this standard\
    \ network performance and trade-offs are discussed in [24]. In [25], the\nreliable\
    \ communication model based on this standard is assumed for WSNs in a Smart\n\
    Grid. Some adaptations of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard are used in our solution\
    \ and they are\ndescribed in Section 4.\nThe variable structure of the network\
    \ is also challenging for routing. Various routing\nprotocols were recently studied\
    \ and proposed in term of CR MANET. The paper [26]\npresents a performance evaluation\
    \ of IETF MANET routing protocols (DYMO, OLSR, and\nAODV) against a mobility model\
    \ of nodes using the NS2 discrete network simulation tool.\nA wide comparison\
    \ of routing protocols proposed for use in WSN is discussed in [27].\nFor short\
    \ distance CR networks, the Enhancement of Opportunistic Ad-hoc On Demand\nDistance\
    \ Vector (EOAODV) is proposed in [28]. Here, the next hop selection is based\n\
    on the signal level of the neighboring nodes, shortest distance, and the lowest\
    \ Expected\nTransmission Count (ETC).\nThe context-aware routing mechanisms are\
    \ also studied; such a method is proposed\nby [29] for a standalone communication\
    \ system using contextual information as delivery\nprobability and link quality.\
    \ The link quality is a metric often proposed as a criterion used\nin MAC protocols\
    \ which has been discussed in [30]. This paper presents a summarized\nstudy of\
    \ various MANET algorithms and protocols to ﬁnd the best available path and\n\
    travel data along the network to the destination.\nEfﬁcient Dynamic Spectrum Management\
    \ balances the energy consumption problem,\neliminates conﬂicts between the nodes,\
    \ reduces the channel interference, and divides the\ntrafﬁc over different channels\
    \ and time slots. In [31], a new channel management algorithm\nfor Cognitive Radio\
    \ Sensor Networks is proposed, which increases the energy efﬁciency\nusing a hidden\
    \ Markov model (HMM). The proposed algorithm adaptively selects its oper-\nation\
    \ mode among channel sensing, channel switching, and data transmission/reception,\n\
    according to the channel-sensing outcome.\nA review of the state-of-the-art MAC\
    \ protocols focused on CRAHN is presented in [32]\nin the context of free spectrum\
    \ recognition, available resource scheduling, and coordination\nof heterogeneous\
    \ systems and users.\nAnother important issue in CR MANET implementation concerns\
    \ security aspects.\nThis is a multilevel problem connected with the vulnerability\
    \ of any kind of actions\n(including attacks) against communication, information,\
    \ network, nodes, and users. One of\nthe problems is to build a system of trust\
    \ for nodes (users) that cooperate with each other,\nhaving an important inﬂuence\
    \ on the cognitive system behavior. The Distributed Denial-\nof-Service (DDOS)\
    \ is an example of persistent attack that affects the network behavior.\nIn [33],\
    \ a Machine Learning technique is proposed to detect DDOS attack. Another issue\n\
    concerning a comparison of symmetrical key algorithms for IoT devices is discussed\
    \ in [34].\nMilitary CR MANET is designed to handle trafﬁc with very different\
    \ characteristics,\nfrom short, periodically sent messages with Blue Force Tracking\
    \ (BFT) containing position\ndata, up to video transmission with high randomness\
    \ of duration, that requires high\nthroughputs between nodes. Two problems are\
    \ related to trafﬁc. The ﬁrst one is devoted\nto trafﬁc control, and the second\
    \ one relates to trafﬁc models used in evaluation. The\nlatter have a signiﬁcant\
    \ impact on the results of CR network performance. In [35], the\ntrafﬁc analysis\
    \ using MANET in WSN is provided in a context of anonymous routing\nprotocols\
    \ relying on hop-by-hop encryption or redundant trafﬁc. A statistical trafﬁc pattern\n\
    discovery system is proposed. Another proposal for trafﬁc control is presented\
    \ in [36]. This\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052\n6 of 21\nMin-Max Scheduling Load Balancing\
    \ (M2SLB) improves the network throughput, packet\ndelivery ratio, and minimizes\
    \ delay and packet loss.\n2.3. Software Process for CR Waveform Design\nThe development\
    \ of CR consists of two phases: speciﬁcation and validation. In the ﬁrst\nstep,\
    \ the requirements for the CR network are deﬁned and their capabilities are speciﬁed.\n\
    It also concerns the choice of AI procedure implementation with algorithmic Machine\n\
    Learning and statistical decision making. At the beginning, we assumed implementing\n\
    clustered network as better matched to hierarchical command organization [37].\n\
    In the second phase, coded blocks of the waveform are validated during unit tests\n\
    and ﬁnally, global solutions are assessed in integrated tests. In general, each\
    \ node in a\nMANET generates multiple streams of packets that are directed to\
    \ other nodes. These\nstreams relate to user and trafﬁc signaling with different\
    \ quality requirements depending\non their type. Network performance can be measured\
    \ at all layers of the communication\nstack. However, usefulness of speciﬁc metrics,\
    \ cost related to necessary computation effort,\nand consumption of resources\
    \ for results transmission are different.\nA set of speciﬁc metrics was used in\
    \ [35] to assess a MANET WSN performance. This\nevaluation contains characteristics\
    \ of packet drop, throughput, and packet delivery ratio in\ntime showing an impact\
    \ of disturbance on the network. Other parameters were used in [38]\nfor the evaluation\
    \ of various network trafﬁc impacts on characteristics of CR networks\nbased on\
    \ the IEEE 802.22 standard.\nIn our studies, two types of metrics are analyzed:\
    \ metrics for the ongoing evaluation of\ntransmission parameters, showing their\
    \ changes over time, called time-dependent metrics.\nIn addition, average metrics\
    \ are used to evaluate the link parameters, called per stream\nmetrics. The most\
    \ important metrics selected from this set to assess our solution are\ndescribed\
    \ below. The calculation formulas were taken from [39] where the wide set of\n\
    metrics proposed for the evaluation of MANET CR is discussed.\n2.3.1. Time-Dependent\
    \ Metrics\nFor instantaneous evaluation of transmission performance, three metrics\
    \ were cho-\nsen, namely: temporary Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI),\
    \ instantaneous value\nof Packet Error Rate (PER), and instantaneous value of\
    \ throughput–R. The calculation\nformulas are as below:\n•\ntemporary RSSI (RSSI(t))\
    \ of the r-th packet stream sent by the i-th node and registered\nin the j-th\
    \ node [dBm]:\nRSSIr\nij(t) = 10 log10\n Precr\nij(t) [mW]\n1 [mW]\n!\n(1)\nwhere:\
    \ Precr\nij(t)—received signal power, measured in the j-th node at a moment t\
    \ of\npacket reception; for packets belongs to the r-th stream sent by the i-th\
    \ node [mW].\n•\ninstantaneous value of PER (PER(t)) of the r-th stream between\
    \ the i-th and j-th node:\nPERr\nij(t) =\nLr\nij(t)\nDr\nij(t)\n(2)\nwhere: Lr\n\

    \ of Cognitive Radio that enables us to\ndetermine which part of the spectrum\
    \ is unused and which is occupied by other users:\nprimary users and secondary\
    \ users, or which part of the spectrum is jammed. Classical\ntheory shows that\
    \ a matched ﬁlter is optimal to detect known signals. If the signal is\nunknown,\
    \ the Energy Detector (ED) is most often used because of its low computational\n\
    complexity and implementation simplicity [40].\nIn the presented solution, multichannel\
    \ sensing is proposed. Here, the monitored\nfrequency range is divided into a\
    \ set of channels using a ﬁlter bank. Each output of this\nbank is connected with\
    \ ED. A Weighted Overlap-Add (WOLA) ﬁlter bank is proposed\nin [41]. The WOLA\
    \ ﬁlter algorithm realizes calculations for L samples of the signal located\n\
    in the L-length buffer; next, the results of sample multiplication with a ﬁlter\
    \ impulse\nresponse are divided into L/K blocks of K samples; and K-point Fourier\
    \ transform is\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052\n8 of 21\ncomputed using the sum of ordered\
    \ samples from each data block. ED computes the signal\nenergy in the time domain\
    \ using the formula below:\nE = ∑\nN\ni=1|y(i)|2\n(8)\nHere, the output of ED\
    \ can be the minimum energy of a sample from the set speciﬁed\nby the number of\
    \ signal time slots, the maximum energy of the sample from the set speciﬁed\n\
    by the number of signal time slots, the average energy for a single sample, and\
    \ the energy\nfor a certain number of time slots.\nKnowledge of the noise power\
    \ is required to properly set the decision threshold,\nwhich is the main disadvantage\
    \ of the ED, because the channel conditions vary and change\nin each node location,\
    \ so the sensing decision can also vary inside a cluster. To prevent this,\ncooperative\
    \ sensing inside clusters is proposed by the authors [42]. Here, the individual\n\
    measures from nodes are sent to the CH that performs algorithm data fusion, makes\
    \ the\nchannel ranking list, and selects the best channel as a backup. CH decisions\
    \ are then\ndistributed within the cluster. An example of a ranking list is shown\
    \ in Figure 3.\n \nIn the presented solution, multichannel sensing is proposed.\
    \ Here, the monitored fre-\nquency range is divided into a set of channels using\
    \ a filter bank. Each output of this bank \nis connected with ED. A Weighted Overlap-Add\
    \ (WOLA) filter bank is proposed in [41]. \nThe WOLA filter algorithm realizes\
    \ calculations for L samples of the signal located in the \nL-length buffer; next,\
    \ the results of sample multiplication with a filter impulse response \nare divided\
    \ into L/K blocks of K samples; and K-point Fourier transform is computed \nusing\
    \ the sum of ordered samples from each data block. ED computes the signal energy\
    \ \nin the time domain using the formula below: \nE = ෍\n|ݕ(݅)|ଶ\nே\n௜ୀଵ\n  \n\
    (8)\nHere, the output of ED can be the minimum energy of a sample from the set\
    \ specified \nby the number of signal time slots, the maximum energy of the sample\
    \ from the set spec-\nified by the number of signal time slots, the average energy\
    \ for a single sample, and the \nenergy for a certain number of time slots. \n\
    Knowledge of the noise power is required to properly set the decision threshold,\
    \ \nwhich is the main disadvantage of the ED, because the channel conditions vary\
    \ and \nchange in each node location, so the sensing decision can also vary inside\
    \ a cluster. To \nprevent this, cooperative sensing inside clusters is proposed\
    \ by the authors [42]. Here, the \nindividual measures from nodes are sent to\
    \ the CH that performs algorithm data fusion, \nmakes the channel ranking list,\
    \ and selects the best channel as a backup. CH decisions are \nthen distributed\
    \ within the cluster. An example of a ranking list is shown in Figure 3. \n \n\

    \ cognitive blocks are responsible for cooperative spectrum sensing,\nperformed\
    \ in dedicated sensing slots of the TDMA frame, and realization of the proposed\n\
    proactive algorithm, based on the best alternative channel selection by the cluster\
    \ head,\nand its dissemination between cluster members. The algorithm also contains\
    \ a search\nprocedure, enabling fast restoration of the cluster operation in the\
    \ case of jamming.\nThe cognitive manager was implemented in all nodes in the\
    \ network. It can be\nconﬁgured in two modes: RN or CH mode. In the RN mode, CM\
    \ is responsible for\ncollecting information from the sensing module and the basic\
    \ waveform, processing them,\nand preparing results for sending to CH. It also\
    \ reacts to received commands from CH\n(e.g., changing the data channel). CM in\
    \ CH mode collects metrics from all nodes and\nchooses the best channel for transmission.\
    \ Control frames between regular nodes and CH\nare sent via the same channel as\
    \ user data; therefore, each node must monitor its own\nchannel to be sure that\
    \ it is not jammed. For this reason, energy detection is performed on\neach slot.\
    \ Sensing and PER results are sent to CH. Based on these metrics and information\n\
    from the MAC layer, CM can assign the slot to one of three states: no transmission,\
    \ own\ntransmission, the channel is jammed.\nCM changes the data channel in the\
    \ case of two events:\n•\nwhen it detects that its own channel is being jammed,\n\
    •\nwhen the threshold of the average PER calculated for all relations in the network\
    \ is\nexceeded.\nThe monitoring of outband channels was performed by the SM that\
    \ uses the energy\ndetection method, with the WOLA ﬁlter that splits one channel\
    \ into a deﬁned number\nof subchannels. Energy detection is performed for each\
    \ of them. This method increases\ninformation about the degree of channel occupancy\
    \ and allows us to detect narrowband\nsignals.\nThe efﬁciency of the proposed\
    \ method was experimentally veriﬁed, and results are\nincluded in the paper.\n\

    \ was prepared\nto emulate real radio environmental conditions for soldiers equipped\
    \ with mobile radios,\nrealizing speciﬁc scenarios such as patrol, base/convoy\
    \ protection, etc. All tests were\nperformed using a real-time demonstrator consisting\

    \ node conﬁguration was performed by a Scenario Management Station,\nwhich allows\
    \ the user to select the scenario and send conﬁguration ﬁles with waveform\nparameters\
    \ to all nodes (for instance, available channels). During the tests, the components\n\
    were mounted on a vest, dressed by scenario participants, walking according to\

    \ can be observed between network propagation\nand jammer activities. In this\
    \ case, there is no communication between all or some nodes.\nThe CH has to make\
    \ a decision, based on sensing information from all nodes, to stay on the\nnetwork\
    \ channel or to choose a better channel to recover communication in the network.\n\
    During the channel change, the CH sends a packet to all nodes with a request to\
    \ change a\nchannel and all available regular nodes change their channel. If they\
    \ cannot receive packets\ncorrectly from the CH node, they try to ﬁnd communication\
    \ on other channels, starting\nfrom the best channels from channel list.\nThe\
    \ next two graphs show PER and throughput for this relationship. Sometimes, PER\n\
    is equal to 1 (for example between 30 s and 42 s), even though there is no jamming\
    \ signal\non the transmission frequency. This is caused by interference from the\
    \ jammer signal in the\nneighboring channel and the very short distance (about\
    \ 15 m) between the jammer and receiver.\nFigure 16 presents the time of network\
    \ synchronization on the data channel. This time\nis between 2 and 5 s, and it\
    \ mostly equals to approximately 3 s (median value presented by\nthe red line).\
    \ These results are in line with the assumptions. Greater values are associated\n\
    with signal reception problems caused by propagation channel impact or RF fronted\n\
    imperfection. The number of data channel changes by the network depended mainly\
    \ on\nthe jamming activity and other interferences from radio sources not deﬁned\
    \ in the scenario.\nThe shortest time of transmission breaks happens between nodes\
    \ 1 and 2 (Figure 17),\nwhere node 1 transmitted data to node 2. Breaks with durations\
    \ of 2 and 3 s occurred\nﬁve times, which is equal to the number of collisions\
    \ between network transmission and\nthe jamming signal. Longer breaks also occurred\
    \ but they were caused by propagation\nSensors 2021, 21, 1052\n16 of 21\nconditions,\
    \ and nodes needed longer time to recover their synchronization. Short distances\n\
    between these nodes and mostly good propagation channel conditions lead to synchroniza-\n\
    tion between nodes very quickly. The worst situation can be observed for the relationship\n\
    between nodes 4 and 3 where the synchronization time is between 7 and 8 s (Figure\
    \ 18).\nThis is due to two reasons. First, node 4 sent only HELLO messages to\
    \ node 3 every 2.5 s, so\nthis is a minimum time when node 3 can establish a link\
    \ state for this relationship. Second,\nthe propagation conditions are unfavorable\
    \ because the signal from node 4 was received\nat a low RSSI level (Figure 19).\
    \ RSSI was calculated in the OFDM demodulator. It shows\nan impact of the radio\
    \ channel on the received radio signal, even if AGC was enabled to\nimprove performance.\
    \ The scenario was performed in an urban area, where multipath\neffects were expected.\
    \ Additionally, the low power of the transmitted signal resulted in\npower being\

    Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have taken a giant leap in scale, expanding\
    \ their applica-\nbility to a large variety of technological domains and applications,\
    \ ranging from the Internet of things\n(IoT) for smart cities and smart homes\
    \ to wearable technology healthcare applications, underwater,\nagricultural and\
    \ environmental monitoring and many more. This expansion is rapidly growing every\n\
    passing day in terms of the variety, heterogeneity and the number of devices which\
    \ such applications\nsupport. Data collection is commonly the core application\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks, which are\ntypically composed of a large variety of\
    \ devices, some constrained by their resources (e.g., processing,\nstorage, energy)\
    \ and some by highly diverse demands. Many challenges span all the conceptual\n\
    communication layers, from the Physical to the Applicational. Many novel solutions\
    \ devised in the\npast do not scale well with the exponential growth in the population\
    \ of the devices and need to\nbe adapted, revised, or new innovative solutions\
    \ are required to comply with this massive growth.\nFurthermore, recent technological\
    \ advances present new opportunities which can be leveraged in\nthis context.\
    \ This paper provides a cross-layer perspective and review of data gathering in\
    \ WSN and\nIoT networks. We provide some background and essential milestones that\
    \ have laid the foundation\nof many subsequent solutions suggested over the years.\
    \ We mainly concentrate on recent state-of-\nthe-art research, which facilitates\
    \ the scalable, energy-efﬁcient, cost-effective, and human-friendly\nfunctionality\
    \ of WSNs and the novel applications in the years to come.\nKeywords: wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs); Internet of things (IoT); data gathering; wearables;\n\
    compressed sensing; network coding; mobile sink; energy harvesting\n1. Introduction\n\
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are data measurement and gathering networks\nbased\
    \ on small hardware (HW) units capable of sensing, monitoring, or measuring their\n\
    surroundings. The sensed data are transmitted directly or by relay via other sensors\
    \ to\nsome sink or server or a base station. The ultimate objective of such a\
    \ conﬁguration is to\nprovide control or exploration capabilities over an area\
    \ where the network is deployed.\nWSN characteristics can vary substantially:\
    \ they can be composed of a few to hundreds of\nthousands of sensors; the monitored\
    \ terrain can range from a small coverage area (e.g., the\nhuman body) to a vast\
    \ realm (e.g., a forest area for ﬁre detection); the sensed variables of\ninterest\
    \ of the surroundings are diverse (e.g., weather or health parameters, acceleration,\n\
    pollution); and the sensors can have different characteristics (e.g., size, computational\n\
    power, energy source).\nThe Internet of things (IoT) aims to improve day-to-day\
    \ life. The concept includes\nsmart cities, smart homes, pervasive health care,\
    \ assisted living, environmental monitoring,\nsurveillance, and so on. The IoT\
    \ paradigm relies on interconnecting a large number of\ndevices (things) linked\
    \ by the Internet via heterogeneous access networks through which\nthey can exchange\
    \ information with one or more Internet gateways that can process the\ndata, take\
    \ action, and forward them to another destination if needed. Since many IoT\n\
    devices are expected to be wireless, and since sensing is one of the main tasks\
    \ and tools\nutilized by the IoT paradigm, IoT systems will rely extensively on\
    \ WSN technology. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22072650\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n2 of 44\nscale of\
    \ scenarios where WSN are deployed nowadays is vast. Traditionally, WSN were\n\
    classiﬁed based on their placement (e.g., terrestrial, underground, multimedia)\
    \ [1]. Since\nWSNs are closely associated with IoT, contemporary classiﬁcation\
    \ tends to re-attribute the\nnotions of the WSN domain to the IoT domain [2] and\
    \ classify them based on their primary\nobjectives, such as smart cities [3,4],\
    \ healthcare [5], retail and leisure [6], utilities (e.g., smart\nhome energy\
    \ control, water metering and leak detection, and other general infrastructure\n\
    monitoring networks) [7], agriculture and environmental safety (e.g., smart farming\
    \ and\nharvesting, pest control [8–10], seismology monitoring [11,12], oceanology\
    \ [13]), and more.\nAs previously explained, one of the main tasks of both WSN\
    \ and IoT systems is\ndata collection and dissemination. Reports are collected\
    \ from the devices, and updates\nand operational assignments are distributed.\
    \ Maintenance and functional assessments\nare also collected and disseminated.\
    \ Data collection and dissemination in very dense\nnetworks such as WSNs and IoT\
    \ networks which span heterogeneous devices, a signiﬁcant\npercentage of which\
    \ are expected to be small, with very constrained processing, storage,\nand energy\
    \ resources and with minimal network capabilities, is challenging and draws\n\
    signiﬁcant attention both by the industrial and academic communities. Some of\
    \ these\nchallenges include: (i) Information management — the amount of information\
    \ collected or\nneeding to be disseminated to the relevant entities is enormous,\
    \ and some is expected to be\nredundant, both in terms of the information sent\
    \ by each device, which can be compressed,\nand in terms of same information received\
    \ by different entities. Accordingly, innovative\ntechniques are required for\
    \ data compression to reduce transmitted data over wireless\nchannels and aggregation\
    \ techniques that exploit the redundancy between information sent\nby the different\
    \ entities. (ii) Data analysis and reaction — the expected vast data exchange\n\
    and the low latency requirement (at least for some of the information collected)\
    \ require\nprocessing and analysis of data in real-time or near real-time, to\
    \ enable timely decision\nmaking and instantaneous action-taking.\nThe ability\
    \ to successfully transmit and gather vast streams of data incoming from an\n\
    enormous number of devices and sensors and ﬁnally to successfully analyze them,\
    \ in order\nto automatically control a much larger scope of everyday life systems,\
    \ directly couples\nthe process of data gathering with Big Data related challenges\
    \ (e.g., [14–17]). Furthermore,\nleveraging Cloud Computing platforms offers signiﬁcant\
    \ advances in data analytical abil-\nities (e.g., [18–20]). It provides new horizons\
    \ to further develop and increase the size of\nWSN/IoT networks both in the sense\
    \ of the number of sensing units and in the sense of\nthe amount of the acquired\
    \ data (e.g., [21–23]). (iii) Connectivity — collecting and dissem-\ninating data\
    \ from and to many devices, potentially through vast, dense, heterogeneous\nnetworks,\
    \ will be one of the biggest challenges of the future of IoT; accordingly, novel\n\
    MAC protocols and coding schemes should be devised to comply with this challenge.\
    \ With\nthis respect, air time utilization and energy efﬁciency are of primary\
    \ importance for the\nMAC layer protocol design. Any MAC layer protocol should\
    \ ensure that devices utilize the\nwireless channel frugally and with minimum\
    \ energy consumption. (iv) Security and Pri-\nvacy — Connecting enormous numbers\
    \ of devices to the Internet exposes the IoT network\nto serious security vulnerabilities.\
    \ All the more so since the relevant entities are limited.\nAccordingly, issues\
    \ such as authenticity, data encryption, and vulnerability to attacks (e.g.,\n\
    device impersonation) are critical for the IoT paradigm’s continuous growth (e.g.,\
    \ [24]).\nIn addition, since the information transmitted over the WSN and IoT\
    \ networks can be\nhighly conﬁdential (e.g., health reports, device tracking),\
    \ the collection and dissemination\nof this information create signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ related to data protection and privacy.\nThis survey will explore the state-of-the-art\
    \ of data collection and dissemination as-\npects in WSNs and IoT environments\
    \ mentioned above. We will review essential milestones\nyet mainly focus on recent\

    \ included mainly Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and our university’s library\ndatabases,\
    \ utilizing the keywords of this paper. We also used important references from\n\
    the bilbiography of the initial papers and ones that cited them. Data collection\
    \ spans all the\nnetworking layers, from the physical implementation of transmitting\
    \ bits across a commu-\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n3 of 44\nnication medium to the\
    \ application layer. Due to the wide-ranging scope of the topic, we\nwill not\
    \ be able to cover all its aspects (for example, in this paper, we will not discuss\
    \ the\ncritical topic of security and privacy). Some of the issues will be covered\
    \ more thoroughly\nthan others. However, since some of the topics we discussed\
    \ rely on the general wireless\ncommunication technology and on broad setup protocols\
    \ which are not data-gathering ori-\nented per se, on some of the topics, we will\
    \ provide a more comprehensive background and\ndescribe protocols that are aimed\
    \ at a broader domain than data-gathering. For example,\nmany medium access control\
    \ (MAC) and wireless routing protocols are designed for a\nwide range of topologies,\
    \ trafﬁc patterns, quality of service requirements, etc. Even though\nthey can\
    \ be applied, they are not explicitly designed for data gathering. We will include\n\
    some more general yet essential studies in our survey. To grasp the whole picture\
    \ and to\nbetter understand some data-gathering-related issues, in some cases,\
    \ we will delve into the\npertinent background and stray into some peripheral\
    \ topics. We will cover topics related to\nall layers of the protocol stack. Sometimes\
    \ classiﬁcation based on a stack is not clear-cut, as\nsome of the issues involve\
    \ multiple stacks.\nIn particular, the survey comprises the following topics:\n\
    The device’s platform, which accommodates the sensing unit, can highly impact\
    \ the\nperformance of the application utilizing it and speciﬁcally the data-gathering\
    \ application,\nand vice versa, the application (e.g., data gathering) can impact\
    \ the platform architecture\nwhen designed in application-oriented manner or when\
    \ some of the essential features and\nrequirements are taken into account in the\
    \ platform design process. The same mutual\neffect also applies to the WSN infrastructure\
    \ and the network architecture (e.g., topology,\nsystem organization). We start\
    \ with reviewing studies pertaining to the general device’s\nplatform and infrastructure-related\
    \ novelties (Section 2). We cover new domains which\nwere only recently exposed\
    \ to WSN and IoT networks and introduced new opportunities for\nalgorithm design\
    \ in such networks. Some of these novel technologies have revolutionized\nthe\
    \ way applications can utilize each particular device as well as the shared network\
    \ and\nhave enabled new algorithm opportunities and design challenges across the\
    \ entire protocol\nstack which we describe throughout this survey.\nNext follows\
    \ Section 3 which provides a focused summary of recent advances in\ncompressed\
    \ sensing—a signal processing technique that can take advantage of sparsity\n\
    and redundancy of the data. In the context of data gathering procedures, compressed\n\
    sensing is utilized to reduce report payload at several levels, which include\
    \ reduction of\nthe sensed data size and the transmitted report size, by pruning\
    \ the devices that need to\nsend reports and by compressing the combined relayed\
    \ data before forwarding it toward\nits destination (the sink). We provide a basic\
    \ compressed sensing background and review\nthe state-of-the-art in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\nSection 4 considers the medium access control (MAC)\
    \ sublayer. In wireless communi-\ncation, channel utilization is critical and\
    \ broadly inﬂuences several performance aspects\nsuch as throughput, latency,\
    \ power utilization, delivery ratio, and more. Over the years,\nnumerous algorithms\
    \ and protocols have been suggested for wireless channel access in\ngeneral, and\
    \ WSNs with their speciﬁc characterization in particular. In Section 4, we review\n\
    only a small fraction of the countless MAC protocols that have been designed for\
    \ WSNs.\nWe mainly concentrate on protocols that highlight a conceptual approach\
    \ or trend and\nreview some of the more recent MAC protocols in data gathering\
    \ in WSN and IoT networks,\nwhich address new challenges such as highly dense\
    \ networks, congested channels, and\nvery limited resources.\nWe ascend the protocol\
    \ stack and in Section 5 we address routing aspects. As with the\nMAC sublayer,\
    \ routing protocols in multi-hop wireless networks have also been extensively\n\
    studied. We start by providing several milestones in the context of data gathering\
    \ in\nWSNs. We continue with more recent studies which mainly include enhancements\
    \ to the\naforementioned protocol, taking into account new challenges such as\
    \ scalability demands\nand energy-related advances which present new opportunities\
    \ yet impose new constraints.\nWe continue with studies that leverage the multi-hop\
    \ topology to realize a network-coding\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n4 of 44\nmechanism.\
    \ Finally, we discuss a new paradigm that extends the traditional setup in which\n\
    the sensed data need to be routed toward a static central monitoring station (sink),\
    \ and\nutilize a mobile sink (or sinks) that traverse the terrain and can help\
    \ in collecting the devices’\nreports. We review several state-of-the-art schemes\
    \ in this mobile sink paradigm.\nThe ﬁnal section of this survey is dedicated\
    \ to wearable technology in the form of\nsmart devices that are attached to the\
    \ human body to monitor the user and their envi-\nronment. Wearable technology\
    \ involves challenges in all the aspects discussed in the\nprevious sections,\
    \ yet they introduce new opportunities for high-demand applications with\nunique\
    \ performance requirements and constraints. Even though we do not attempt to\n\
    provide a comprehensive review of the numerous applications suggested over the\
    \ years, we\nemphasize this prominent application layer and discuss several applications\
    \ in Section 6.\nAs previously explained, we roughly partitioned the topics covered\
    \ in this survey\nbased on the communication layers and organized the sections\
    \ accordingly. We note\nthat this partition is somehow artiﬁcial, as many innovations\
    \ in data-gathering involve\nmore than one layer. Furthermore, many technological\
    \ advances and research areas affect\nmultiple domains in different layers and\
    \ are visited in more than one section. Figure 1\ndepicts the schematic structure\
    \ of the paper. In the ﬁgure, the ovals represent the main\nresearch domains covered\
    \ in the paper. The hexagons represent the most prominent\nresearch tool innovations\
    \ and techniques utilized by data-gathering, which are covered in\nthe paper.\
    \ The arrows represent the inter-relation between them. For example, technologies\n\
    such as energy harvesting (EH) or Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    (AI) are utilized by innovations in all the layers starting from the platform\
    \ hardware to\nthe application layer. However, network coding is mainly utilized\
    \ by the network layer.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is leveraged by both the\

    \ Concepts\nOur primary focus in this survey is data gathering in the context\
    \ of wireless commu-\nnication networks. The units that generate the data (typically\
    \ sensors) are application-\ndependent and can serve a large variety of realms,\
    \ e.g., health, environmental, activity\nmonitoring, etc. Even though the sensing\
    \ unit is the essence, we will not cover it thor-\noughly, and we will only skim\
    \ through it sporadically when discussing applications and\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n5 of 44\ntheir speciﬁc requirements. Nonetheless, the term “sensor” typically\
    \ refers to the whole\nplatform or device in which the sensing unit is only one\
    \ component out of many, such as\nprocessing unit, transceiver unit, power unit,\
    \ antenna, and more, several of which can be\nintegrated into the device according\
    \ to the particular application needs. The sensing unit\nitself has its own requirements\
    \ and constraints, and in many situations cannot be altered.\nIn addition, the\
    \ integrated unit architecture and the platform design can be subject to\nvarious\
    \ stringent constraints. For example, size requirements can impose a strict constraint\n\
    on the device design; low power consumption, low production cost, and self-operation\
    \ can\nrepresent additional constraints. Accordingly, the device architecture\
    \ is fundamental and\naffects many other factors in the system. For example, power\
    \ supply affects the life span\n(or the time needed to replace the batteries);\
    \ it also affects transmission range, memory,\nand processing unit, which in turn\
    \ can affect the algorithms that can be executed on the\ndevice, etc.\nExtensive\
    \ research has been conducted on the design and architecture of the end\ndevice\
    \ and the infrastructure. We leave a detailed description of the basic components\
    \ such\nas the sensing unit, transceiver, antenna, processing unit, etc., as well\
    \ as the underlying\nhardware beyond the scope of this survey. To this end, the\
    \ objective of the rest of this section\nrefers to how data-gathering objectives\
    \ may impact both the design of speciﬁc sensors\nand the WSN infrastructure. By\
    \ the latter, we mean topology, system organization used to\ngather the data,\
    \ and algorithms to implement the data gathering. It is noteworthy that the\n\
    sensors’ characteristics also dictate the topology and, consequently, the data\
    \ aggregation\nalgorithms. In the sequel, we mention several platform architecture\
    \ designs as well as\nseveral network-wide architectures, mostly from recent years.\
    \ Additional similar studies\nappear throughout the survey, yet they are organized\
    \ in chapters according to the area in\nwhich they propose the most signiﬁcant\
    \ novelty. Figure 2 presents a schematic description\nof the section. Since several\
    \ papers presented in this section cover more than one topic, and\nsince, as previously\
    \ mentioned, this section is not presumed to provide an exhaustive list\nof all\
    \ papers or topics covered by the scope of WSN architecture, and some of the topics\
    \ are\nnot covered at all or covered by only a few representative papers, the\
    \ description is broad\nand only highlights the main topics covered in the section.\n\

    \ topics covered in the section.\n2.1. Application-Oriented\nMany sensor platforms\
    \ are application-oriented. Occasionally, their suggested ar-\nchitecture can\
    \ be applied to other applications; however, their design and evaluation are\n\
    typically aimed at a speciﬁc one. Hence, in many cases, both hardware and software\n\
    technological developments are introduced for effective functioning. One of the\
    \ most\ncommon tasks of WSN is the obvious one of monitoring a terrain. There\
    \ are many variants\nof WSN monitoring. For example, the requirement can be to\
    \ monitor every point in the\nField of Interest (FoI) vs. monitoring a limited\
    \ number of speciﬁc locations or targets (aka\ntarget coverage) vs. just monitoring\
    \ a border of a region to detect intruders (aka barrier\ncoverage). The coverage\
    \ problem typically involves selecting a subset of sensors that fulﬁll\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n6 of 44\nthe monitoring objective while maintaining network\
    \ connectivity. The sensors’ capabilities\nand the monitoring objective determine\
    \ the network topology.\nWe present several recent examples that mainly concentrate\
    \ on connectivity and data\ngathering under the constraints of the monitoring\
    \ objective. Biswas et al. [25] focus on\nenergy-efﬁcient data gathering in target\
    \ coverage problem, in which an n sensor WSN\nneeds to monitor T speciﬁc targets,\
    \ and there exists a route (multi-hop) from each source to\nthe sink. The paper\
    \ assumes that the source nodes that sense the targets and initiate data\npackets\
    \ into the network are known, and deals with the forwarding of these packets to\n\
    the sink. The paper proposes a distributed data gathering algorithm in which after\
    \ each\nnode discovers its neighbors and their hop-count to the sink, it will\
    \ forward data packets\n(when required) to its neighbor with maximum remaining\
    \ energy and a lower hop count\nto the sink (the remaining energy is assumed to\
    \ be known). Ammari [26] focuses on the\nk-coverage problem in which each point\
    \ in the FoI is required to be covered by at least k\nsensors at any time, and\
    \ each active sensor participating in the monitoring task is required\nto be connected\
    \ to the sink (possibly via a multi-hop route). The paper assumes that the\nsensors\
    \ are heterogeneous (they do not have the same characteristics) and mobile, hence\n\
    the sensors can move toward any region of interest in the deployment ﬁeld to participate\
    \ in\nany deﬁcient k-coverage area and can also act as mobile proxy sinks that\
    \ collect sensed data\nfrom the sensors and deliver them to the sink. Ammari [26]\
    \ partitions the problem into\ntwo problems which are solved sequentially. Namely,\
    \ the mobile k-coverage problem, which\nselects a minimum subset of active sensors\
    \ that solve the k-coverage problem and the data\ngathering problem, and devise\
    \ a forwarding scheme from the active sensors to the sink such\nthat the energy\
    \ consumption due to sensor mobility and communication is minimized.\nMdemaya\
    \ and Bomgni [27] utilize mobile sensors to achieve area coverage. These\nmobile\
    \ sensors can be moved and relocated to cover holes after the random deployment.\n\
    The authors suggest a two-phase approach. According to the ﬁrst one, the monitoring\n\
    area after the initial random deployment is identiﬁed (by the BS), and mobile\
    \ nodes are\nrelocated to cover the monitoring holes detected after the initial\
    \ deployment, trying to\nensure full coverage of the AoI by the static and relocated\
    \ sensors. At the second stage, the\nproposed algorithm schedules the sensors’\
    \ activity (awakening and transmission times)\nthat minimizes the energy consumption\
    \ of the nodes while collecting and sending data\nto the base station. To this\
    \ end, the paper distinguishes between “normal” nodes and\ncluster heads. A survey\
    \ that reviews algorithms and techniques related to the connectivity-\ncoverage\
    \ issues in WSN can be found in Boukerche and Sun [28].\nOccasionally, WSN architectures\
    \ and designs are more application-oriented. For\nexample, Cerchecci et al. [29]\
    \ propose a sensor node topology that uses low-cost and low-\npower components\
    \ for energy-efﬁcient waste management in the context of smart cities.\nThe architecture\
    \ described in [29] suggests a node architecture for measuring the ﬁlling\nlevel\
    \ of trash bins and utilizes LoRa LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) technology\n\
    for real-time data transmission to collect the measured data in a remote data\
    \ collection\ncenter. The design of a sensor node that can detect the presence\
    \ of water on home ﬂoors and\nprovide early warning of water leaks is suggested\
    \ by Teixidó et al. [30]. The paper presents\nand deploys both hardware and software\
    \ of the network components (ﬂood sensing nodes,\nactuator nodes, and a control\
    \ central); communication within the sensor network relies\non the IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard. Borrero and Zabalo [31] present a low-cost agriculture-\noriented\
    \ system. The suggested system is based on LoRa technology and can collect various\n\
    measurements, such as humidity, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and temperature,\n\
    and enables a farmer to access all of the information necessary to achieve efﬁcient\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement of crops in real time. The developed wireless sensor\
    \ node has been optimized\nboth in hardware and software and exhibits very low\
    \ power consumption.\n2.2. Energy-Harvesting (EH)\nOne of the main concerns of\
    \ the sensor platform’s design is the source of energy.\nTypically, the energy\
    \ source is a battery attached to the sensor platform. It is utilized to\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n7 of 44\nprovide power to all the required operations, e.g.,\
    \ wireless transmission, computation,\nmemory, etc. The battery properties (e.g.,\
    \ technology used and size) can determine its\nlifespan as well as several other\
    \ properties, e.g., transmission range. In many systems,\nthe battery is a burden,\
    \ as it increases the cost of the system, constrains the platform size,\nand most\
    \ importantly, requires to be replaced occasionally. The challenge of saving power\n\
    spans all the protocol stack; energy considerations show up in each part of this\
    \ survey. As\nwith the other layers, PHY layer innovations have also been suggested\
    \ as to how to utilize\nbattery power efﬁciently.\nAn alternative approach to\
    \ overcome the battery hurdle is to embed a mechanism\nthat harvests energy. Such\
    \ a mechanism can be embedded alongside the battery to ex-\ntend its lifespan,\
    \ or more commonly, it can completely replace the battery so that all the\nfunctions\
    \ rely on it. Batteryless WSNs that rely solely on energy-harvesting (EH)-WSN\n\
    can compromise performance; for example, their transmission range can be shorter,\
    \ the\navailable energy can constrain their awake time, and so on. One of the\
    \ main challenges is to\nlocate the ambient resource from which the energy can\
    \ be harvested. Many studies have ex-\nplored different energy sources that can\
    \ supplement energy, such as solar, vibration, wind,\nmotion, electromagnetic,\
    \ and more. Numerous comprehensive technological overviews\nwith their advantages\
    \ and limitations, energy harvesting modeling, challenge expectations,\nand prospects\
    \ can be found in, for example, Refs. [32–37]. A more recent system design\nreview\
    \ on battery-free and energy-aware WSNs, which utilize ambient energy or wireless\n\
    energy transmission, is given in [38]. It addresses energy supply strategies and\
    \ provides\ninsight into energy management methods and possibilities for energy\
    \ saving at the node\nand network levels.\nKhalid et al. [39] suggest a zero-power\
    \ wireless sensor architecture that consists of\na capacitive sensor (a sensor\
    \ that associates the parameter of interest with the change in\nthe capacitance),\
    \ an RFID chip, a circulator (allows power ﬂow between three deﬁned\nports), and\
    \ an antenna (batteryless). The conceptual idea is that the sensor reﬂects the\n\
    signal received from the RFID, with a change in phase, which is relative to the\
    \ sensed value.\nDesign and implementation of an energetically autonomous WSN\
    \ platform for ambient\nmonitoring in indoor environments are suggested by Abella\
    \ et al. [40]. The proposed self-\npowered autonomous sensor node platform relies\
    \ on embedded photo-voltaic (PV) panels\nto harvest the energy, a microcontroller\
    \ and an RF transceiver with an attached antenna.\nThe suggested architecture\
    \ was prototyped and validated experimentally. Lee et al. [41]\npropose a ﬂoating\
    \ wireless device with energy harvesting capability. The ﬂoating device is\nenergetically\
    \ self-sustaining for extended operational hours. It supports long-range com-\n\
    munication between wireless sensor nodes and a gateway relying on the LoRa technology\n\
    while deployed over a water surface. The ﬂoating device can be used as an environmental\n\
    monitoring station to remotely collect weather and water quality information.\
    \ Ref. [42]\npresent the design of a wireless sensor node, powered by solar energy,\
    \ that collects en-\nvironmental data and can transmit it across vast distances\
    \ (directly to the cloud). The\narchitecture presented therein relies on low-power\
    \ wide-area network (LPWAN) protocols\nthat provide a long-range communication\
    \ system with limited data to transmit and high\nenergy efﬁciency. The authors\
    \ utilize Sigfox technology in their proof-of-concept design.\nAs previously mentioned\
    \ in numerous papers, surveys and tutorials exploring dif-\nferent aspects of\
    \ energy harvesting in WSN exist (a sliver of which we present herein).\nWe will\
    \ revisit EH when we discuss various aspects of data aggregation, such as routing\n\
    enhancement for EH-WSN (under EH constraints), on which we elaborate in Section\
    \ 5.2 or\nwhen discussing wearables in Section 6.\n2.3. Topology\nThroughout the\
    \ survey, the interaction of WSN and IoT will arise in multiple contexts.\nWhile\
    \ this survey mainly deals with data gathering by means of wireless units, an\
    \ IoT unit\npresumes a more high-level entity for localized data gathering. To\
    \ assess the connection\nbetween these two concepts, the reader is advised to\
    \ refer to the most recent work by\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n8 of 44\nDevadas et\
    \ al. [43], for example, where the authors enumerate the IoT data management\n\
    frameworks, challenges and issues. The chapter focuses on three layers of data\
    \ management\nin IoT networks, communication, storage and processing. In addition,\
    \ deployment of IoT\nData management for smart home and smart city is described.\n\
    It is essential to distinguish between a one-directional WSN platform, where sensors\n\
    merely gather the data and activate a speciﬁc infrastructure and set of technologies\
    \ to further\nsend it to a sink, and a bi-directional WSN platform, where the\
    \ sensors are expected to be\nable to act according to control messages received\
    \ from a sink. In the latter case, the sink\nmight be a higher-level entity (e.g.,\
    \ a cloud-based server). While the general data-gathering\ntechniques are usually\
    \ agnostic of the control direction, additional constraints might be\nimposed.\
    \ Delay of the responses, latency, BW usage efﬁciency, security, and privacy are\n\
    some of the demands to consider. Another example of a bi-directional platform\
    \ can be\nseen in social sensor clouds (SSC), which connect a social network with\
    \ a sensor network\nvia a cloud infrastructure. See, for example, Zhu et al. [44],\
    \ which presents a scenario of a\nsmart village and provides discussion on various\
    \ aspects including green planning, energy\nconcerns, and speed of data gathering\
    \ and sharing. In Dinh and Kim [45], an on-demand\nWSN platform is designed. The\
    \ authors suggest a data-gathering protocol that addresses\nbandwidth consumption\
    \ and delivery latency and minimizes the number of requests\nto save resources.\
    \ An infrastructure where sensors form groups belonging to private\nowners constitutes\
    \ a special case. This may be the case in a smart city environment; this\nmeans\
    \ that privacy and/or security considerations should be prioritized. This is the\
    \ topic\naddressed by Zhu et al. [46]. The authors provide a trust-assisted cloud\
    \ for WSN but have\nthroughput issues in mind. Kuo et al. [47] suggest a WSN-based\
    \ IoT platform that provides\na reliable connection between sensors in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the database on the Internet. The\nproposed platform is based on the IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4e time-slotted channel-hopping protocol\nwith resource-constrained devices\
    \ supporting heterogeneous applications. The paper\nsuggests a scheme that compensates\
    \ the clock drift for every timeslot to maintain the clock\nsynchronization required\
    \ for the time-slotted channel-hopping protocol.\nEdge computing, as discussed\
    \ by Satyanarayanan [48], allows distributing the data\ngathering burden across\
    \ multiple cloudlets, which might be highly beneﬁcial for large\nWSN. This platform\
    \ paradigm aims to improve many important aspects: reduced latency\nof data delivery,\
    \ increased bandwidth, scalability, resilience to possible cloud outages,\nand\
    \ privacy control. However, the platform presumes an initial capital investment\
    \ and\nlater maintenance.\nA virtual sensor network was proposed by Abdelwahab\
    \ et al. [49]. Once a user-\ninitiated sensing request is dispatched to a cloud,\
    \ a suitable set of sensors is found for\nthe task. The decision is made according\
    \ to the cost function, which depends on the\nspeciﬁc (e.g., monetary) cost of\
    \ using sensors from the designated set, the beneﬁt that\ncan be received from\
    \ using these sensors, and their effectiveness in distances and delays\n(calculated,\
    \ e.g., in number of hops from sensor to a sink/gateway), also expressed as\n\
    virtual links. The cost might be customized, while a general virtualization problem\
    \ is\nformulated and the algorithm is provided.\nIntegration of unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) and WSN for crop monitoring in\nprecision agriculture is described\
    \ by Popescu et al. [50]. The authors suggest a down-up\nscheme, where the collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level to the\ncluster head\
    \ (CH) level, then collected by the UAV level and ﬁnally delivered to the cloud\n\
    for analysis and possible feedback. Particular emphasis is put on outlying measurements\n\
    from speciﬁc sensors, as they can indicate either a possible sensor failure or\
    \ an upcoming\nunusual event inside the agricultural ﬁeld. The measured data were\
    \ processed through a\nconsensus algorithm. Concurrently, it suppressed outlier\
    \ values left for further examination\nfor the cloud-based analysis. In addition,\
    \ this study focused on the UAV trajectory planning\nto collect the data observed\
    \ by the WSN. Actual deployment with several tens of sensors\nand several CHs\
    \ is provided and analyzed. Note that we dedicate Section 5.4 to data\ngathering\
    \ assisted by a mobile unit.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n9 of 44\nAn implementation\
    \ of a ubiquitous consumer data service for transmitting short mes-\nsages to\
    \ any computing platform is provided by Datta et al. [51]. The authors demonstrate\n\
    a data cycle model that allows any device with sensor(s) to report data encoded\
    \ in short\nmessages. The raw data reaches a central or distributed computing\
    \ platform, where it\nundergoes transformation and evolves into rich and structured\
    \ valuable information for\nhigher-layer applications. The proposed data cycle\
    \ model and DataTweet architecture are\naimed at smart city and large-scale crowd-sensing-based\
    \ IoT scenarios.\n2.4. Application-Oriented Network Architecture\nWe continue\
    \ by covering special types of WSN platforms for data gathering and\nspecialized\
    \ application-driven architecture types. Ayele et al. [52] suggest an IoT network\n\
    architecture for wildlife monitoring systems (WMS) for scenarios in which animals\
    \ exhibit\nsparse mobility, which results in sporadic wireless links. In addition,\
    \ they suggest a\ndata forwarding enhancement that adopts the ﬂood-store-carry-and-forward\
    \ paradigm\nsuggested in the seminal ZebraNet study by Juang et al. [53], in which\
    \ in order to send data\nto the sink, the nodes disseminate it among themselves\
    \ until it reaches the sink. Speciﬁcally,\neach node stores the data needing to\
    \ be conveyed, waits for connectivity with other nodes,\nand distributes the data\
    \ to them, and they repeat the same process. Accordingly, the data is\nspread\
    \ throughout the entire network (i.e., ﬂooding) and will eventually be received\
    \ by the\nsink. The authors in [52] suggest leveraging locally available routing\
    \ parameters to improve\nopportunistic data forwarding algorithms by managing\
    \ the data replication decision.\nSaleh et al. [54] suggest extending the lifetime\
    \ of a wireless sensor network used in\nmobile healthcare applications by increasing\
    \ the number of bits transmitted per symbol, and\nspeciﬁcally to rely on a quaternary\
    \ interconnect scheme in which each transmitted symbol\nmodulates two bits. A\
    \ complementary neural network, static RAM-based architecture is\nsuggested to\
    \ reduce energy consumption in storage and transmissions during the data\ndissemination\
    \ process. A WSN dedicated to home deployment for elderly healthcare and\nearly\
    \ health emergency alarm is discussed by Alsina-Pagès et al. [55]. The authors\
    \ ﬁrst raise\nprivacy concerns related to the monitoring, and accordingly, advocate\
    \ that only sound-\nbased surveillance aimed to merely indicate alarming situations\
    \ is appropriate. In order\nto further conform to the privacy demands, they focus\
    \ on distributed architecture (rather\nthan on a centralized one), where each\
    \ of the WSN sensors sends encrypted identiﬁers of\ntheir measurement. The identiﬁcation\
    \ of events is built on feature extraction. This is done\non the frequency domain\
    \ by ﬁrst dividing the incoming signal into blocks with Hamming\nsliding window,\
    \ then transforming into the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier\nTransform\
    \ (DFT) to evaluate the contribution of every band of the spectrum. The ﬁnal\n\
    coefﬁcients are obtained after Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The conclusive\
    \ parts of the\nproposed algorithm classify the coefﬁcients, feeding them into\
    \ Support Vector Machines\nwhich classiﬁes the estimated audio event. The authors\
    \ assert that the classiﬁcation results\ncould be further improved by incorporating\
    \ a deep artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) into\ntheir system.\nIn AbeBer et al.\
    \ [56], a similar method was implemented for urban noise monitoring.\nNamely,\
    \ while STFT was utilized for the noise preprocessing, the classiﬁcation of noise\n\
    levels and events was performed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors\n\
    used several previously published networks; see references therein. Similar methods\
    \ for\nnoise monitoring WSN were introduced by Siamwala et al. [57]. The frequency-domain\n\
    analysis was performed. Then, classiﬁcation by statistical methods was accomplished\n\
    (Gaussian mixture model was used). In addition, the authors in [57] provide an\
    \ elaborate\nWSN architecture, where energy-harvesting solar panels augment the\
    \ sensors’ lifetime and\nthe sensors’ state-of-charge is transmitted and tracked\
    \ by central, more powerful nodes.\n3. Compressed Sensing\nMany data-gathering\
    \ applications rely on numerous self-powered smart devices to\ncollect real-time\
    \ data and convey it via a wireless medium to a central entity or entities\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n10 of 44\n(e.g., the cloud) to further process it and act upon\
    \ it. Such devices are expected to perform\ntwo basic operations—sensing and wireless\
    \ connectivity. Two important hindering aspects\nthat derive from these operations\
    \ inﬂuence the performance and need to be considered\nare: (i) energy consumption\
    \ associated with these two operations, especially when many of\nthese devices\
    \ are typically simple with limited computation abilities and battery lifetime\n\
    (ii) airtime utilization, which can also degrade the performance causing high\
    \ delays, jitter,\nbattery consumption, etc. Accordingly, one of the main challenges\
    \ in combating these\nlimitations is reducing the report payload, which affects\
    \ each report’s transmission time\nand channel utilization. Reducing the payload\
    \ of the sensed data can be accomplished at\ndifferent levels; it can be done\
    \ in the sensing stage by reducing the size of the sensed data, as\nwell as in\
    \ the report preparing stage by compressing the report size, and in the transmission\n\
    stage, by selecting which devices need to send reports, thus limiting redundant\
    \ information.\nWhen the reports need to travel multiple hops before reaching\
    \ their destination, this can\nbe done at the relay stage by pruning, unifying,\
    \ and compressing reports. In the sequel,\nwe discuss Compressed Sensing (CS).\
    \ This novel paradigm can reduce report payload at\nseveral levels mentioned above,\
    \ hence lowering the sensing operation’s transmission time\nand energy consumption.\n\
    Compressed sensing is a signal-processing technique that is most advantageous\
    \ when\nthe subject signal is sparse in some domain, such that a minimal non-zero\
    \ vector of coefﬁ-\ncients can represent it. The signal sparsity enables a high-quality\
    \ reconstruction, which is\nattained by ﬁnding the solution to an under-determined\
    \ linear system of equations with\nthe smallest possible number of non-zero values.\
    \ Thus, a convex minimization problem\nneeds to be solved to perform the recovery.\
    \ Note that the CS technique performs non-\nuniform sampling of the data signal\
    \ with an average sample rate usually smaller than\nthe minimal rate mandated\
    \ by the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. A detailed view\nof the technique can\
    \ be found in Balouchestani et al. [58] and Donoho [59]. Various net-\nworking\
    \ domains can utilize compressed sensing, for example, Feizi et al. [60] depict\
    \ some\napplications of CS over networks and elucidate the connection between\
    \ CS and traditional\ninformation-theoretic techniques in source coding and channel\
    \ coding. Particularly, CS is\nhighly suitable for sensed data gathering in wireless\
    \ sensor networks (e.g., physical phe-\nnomena or a scenery), as it can leverage\
    \ the expected high spatial and temporal correlation\nbetween sensing reports\
    \ sent by neighboring sensors at different times in order to acquire\nthe CS paradigm’s\
    \ desired sparsity. In the following, we review several such data-gathering\n\
    schemes that utilize CS.\nLuo et al. [61,62] consider a densely deployed monitoring\
    \ sensor network in which\nreports traverse multiple hops before reaching their\
    \ destination, a sink. These studies\nrely on the concept that sensors’ readings\
    \ are spatially correlated; hence, there exists a\ntransform domain in which the\
    \ sensed signals can be sparsely represented. Both propose\na compressive data-gathering\
    \ (CDG) procedure in which sensors distributively encode\ntheir reports by projecting\
    \ them on a random space basis using random coefﬁcients. These\nencoded reports\
    \ can be decoded at the sink using compressive sensing techniques. Specif-\nically,\
    \ CDG is designed for multi-hop networks where messages need to travel multiple\n\
    hops before reaching their destination. The sampling process that characterizes\
    \ the CS\ncompression process is performed individually at each sensor by simple\
    \ multiplications\nand additions. Particularly, CDG suggests that rather than\
    \ forwarding individual sensor\nreadings, each sensor uses each of its reports\
    \ (measurements) to construct and send M\ndifferent messages, each comprising\
    \ a weighted sum of the sensor’s own report with other\nsensors’ reports traversing\
    \ it (relaying). Formally, denote by vector d = [d1, d2, . . . , dN]T\nthe measurements\
    \ (readings) obtained by all the sensors, where N is the number of nodes in\n\
    the WSN and di denotes the measurement (reading) obtained by sensor si. The sink\
    \ obtains\nM messages (weighted sums) represented by the vector y = Φd = φ1d1,\
    \ φ2d2, . . . , φNdN,\nwhere Φ is an M × N (M << N) matrix comprising the series\
    \ of coefﬁcients generated\nby the sensors, and in particular, φi is the i-th\
    \ column vector of Φ, which denotes the\nrandom coefﬁcients selected by sensor\
    \ i. Luo et al. [61] suggest that the measurement\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n11\
    \ of 44\nmatrix (coefﬁcients matrix) Φ should be a full random matrix with its\
    \ entries being i.i.d.\nGaussian random numbers drawn according to N (0, 1\nM).\
    \ The paper suggests that each\nweighted sum coefﬁcient be chosen pseudo-randomly\
    \ based on each sensor’s ID in order\nto avoid the burden and high overhead required\
    \ to collect these coefﬁcients by the sink\nif they are chosen randomly. Ref.\
    \ [62] extends the random coefﬁcient selection suggested\nin [61] to an only partly\
    \ random matrix in which the entries of a sub-matrix are still drawn\naccording\
    \ to N (0, 1\nM). Yet, for the rest of the matrix, two options are suggested,\
    \ either an\nupper triangular matrix with non-zero entries drawn according to\
    \ N (0, 1\nM), or the identity\nmatrix. CDG exploits the compressive sampling\
    \ theory and shows that when the sensor\nreadings are compressible, the sink will\
    \ be able to accurately recover the reports even when\nthe number of weighted\
    \ sums (messages) each sensor generates for each report (M) is\nmuch lower than\
    \ the number of reporting sensors (N). For example, on a route comprising\nN sensors,\
    \ the sink needs to collect only M << N messages to encode the information sent\n\
    by all the N sensors.\nSeveral studies further explore the sparsity of the sensed\
    \ signal and its projection\nmatrix, as well as the number of messages (M) that\
    \ should be delivered to the sink. For\nexample, Wang et al. [63] argue that most\
    \ natural signals are nonstationary and ordinarily\nvariable in the temporal and\
    \ spatial domains. In CS, these directly inﬂuence the recon-\nstruction process\
    \ and the number of required measurements; consequently, setting a ﬁxed\nnumber\
    \ of measurements with a ﬁxed transform basis (coefﬁcient matrix Φ) can result\n\
    in poor performance (inaccurate measurement reconstruction). Accordingly, Ref.\
    \ [63]\nsuggests an adaptive data-gathering scheme based on CS, which utilizes\
    \ an autoregressive\n(AR) model to exploit the local spatial correlation between\
    \ sensed data of neighboring\nsensor nodes. The suggested reconstruction scheme\
    \ adapts to the variation of sensed data\nby adjusting the AR parameters. The\
    \ number of measurements is adjusted adaptively\nwith the sensed data by evaluating\
    \ the recovery result and approximating the number of\nmeasurements required to\
    \ satisfy the accuracy demand.\nTo reduce the transmission overhead, Xu et al.\
    \ [64] propose the compressed sparse\nfunction (CSF) scheme. The basic concept\
    \ of CSF is, rather than encode the sensed data\nby projecting it on a basis on\
    \ which it can be represented sparsely, as in typical CS-based\nschemes, to compress\
    \ the sensed data in the form of sparse functions, which are sent to the\nsource.\
    \ The source can recover the function using techniques from polynomial approxi-\n\
    mation/interpolation theory and use them to compute data values that were not\
    \ reported.\nSpeciﬁcally, CSF ﬁnds a function that maps the sensors’ identiﬁers\
    \ and their readings, which\ncan be expressed in a very sparse way, and only communicates\
    \ this function to the sink.\nAfter the sink recovers the function, it can recover\
    \ all the N sensor readings. Xu et al. [64]\nshow that the CSF approach can provide\
    \ good recovery accuracy (better than the CDG\nscheme suggested by [61]) while\
    \ substantially reducing the message overhead (mainly in\ntree-structured networks).\
    \ Li et al. [65] present a general CS framework for WSNs and IoT\nand show how\
    \ the proposed framework can be utilized to reconstruct the compressible\ninformation.\
    \ The suggested framework comprises three phases: (i) information sensing\nto\
    \ detect and compressively sample event signals; (ii) compressed sampling, in\
    \ which the\nsystem samples information traversing the networks; and (iii) reconstruction\
    \ algorithms, in\nwhich the system accurately reconstructs the original signal\
    \ from the compressed samples.\nDifferent studies tackle the sampling issue and\
    \ suggest different approaches to reduce\nthe number of reports sent such that\
    \ only a subset of the sensors sense the object or\nphenomenon at a time. Several\
    \ studies explore how sensed data is conveyed to the sink\nwith the insight that\
    \ the compression is at least attained along the path to the sink, and is\ntherefore\
    \ affected by it. For example, Dhanapala et al. [66] show that a random-walk-based\n\
    sampling, rather than the conventional uniform-sampling-based CS for function\
    \ recovery,\ncan be used for phenomena awareness either at a sink or at other\
    \ sensors without a sink,\nwith minimal additional sampling. As the distribution\
    \ of the samples has a signiﬁcant effect\non the recovery, Ref. [66] suggests\
    \ an upper bound for the probability of successful recovery\nwith a given error\
    \ percentage. The derived bound provides an approximate number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n12 of 44\nsamples required to recover a function under a selected\
    \ basis and a sampling scheme.\nZheng et al. [67] further argue that random walk\
    \ provides a more practical approach for\nthe data-gathering application in WSNs\
    \ and explores the sparsity of collecting non-uniform\nmeasurements while sampling\
    \ along multiple random paths. The paper suggests that\nthe M × N measurement\
    \ matrix will be characterized by M independent random walks.\nSpeciﬁcally, each\
    \ of the M matrix rows corresponds to the set of vertices visited by the\nrespective\
    \ random walk. The paper analyzes the required number of random walks (M)\nand\
    \ their corresponding lengths (how many entries on each row are non-zero) under\
    \ the\nproposed random walk algorithm.\nZheng et al. [68] suggest a cluster-based\
    \ data-gathering mechanism, in which the\nterrain is divided into cells; in each\
    \ cell, a node is randomly selected as the cell head,\nwhich collects the data\
    \ from the cell members and forwards it to the sink. Zheng et al. [68]\nsuggest\
    \ two forwarding mechanisms, one relying on centrally deﬁned tree-based for-\n\
    warding, and another that is a gossip-based approach. The projection process is\
    \ similar\nto Luo et al. [61,62], being based on random coefﬁcients. Another clustering-based\
    \ hi-\nerarchical data aggregation protocol that relies on CS, termed HDACS, is\
    \ suggested by\nXu et al. [69]. Speciﬁcally, HDACS constructs a multilevel hierarchical\
    \ structure and adap-\ntively sets multiple compression thresholds based on cluster\
    \ sizes at different levels of the\ndata aggregation tree to optimize the amount\
    \ of transmitted data. The encoding procedure\nis adapted from [62], where each\
    \ cluster-head recovers (decodes) all received messages\nfrom its descendants\
    \ (retrieves the original data) before compressing and sending it to its\nparent\
    \ cluster-head.\nMotivated by reducing power consumption, Lan and Wei [70] also\
    \ suggest a\ncompressibility-based clustering algorithm for hierarchical compressive\
    \ data gathering. In\nthis study, the network is decomposed into a logical chain,\
    \ and sensor nodes are grouped\nbased on the compressibility of their readings\
    \ instead of by a random clustering approach.\nThis clustering approach strives\
    \ to minimize the average compression ratio of all clusters by\ngreedily selecting\
    \ the set of nodes based on the compression ratio. It then tries to maximize\n\
    the number of compressible clusters so as to determine the suitable transmission\
    \ mode\nfor each cluster using a mode threshold that is a function of the number\
    \ of nodes and the\nnumber of hops from a cluster-head to a sink.\nTo reduce the\
    \ number of sensors involved in each CS measurement, Wu et al. [71]\npropose a\
    \ sparsest random scheduling scheme for compressive data gathering in large-\n\
    scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs), leveraging the spatial-temporal properties\
    \ in the\nsensory data. The central theme of this study is that the measurement\
    \ matrix is designed\nbased on the representation basis and sensory data and according\
    \ to the sensor network\nrequirements rather than the network environment. By\
    \ combining compressed sensing\nand network coding in the data-gathering scheme,\
    \ Yin et al. [72] introduce a multi-hop\ntopology in which the sink node adaptively\
    \ adjusts the measurement formation according\nto the reconstruction of received\
    \ measurements at each data-gathering epoch. The sink\nnode dictates the data\
    \ aggregation performed to balance the energy consumption among\nsensor nodes.\n\
    Xu et al. [73] exploit the CS paradigm for network tomography. Speciﬁcally, Ref.\
    \ [73]\nleverages the fact that, typically, only a small fraction of network entities\
    \ such as links or\nnodes are responsible for anomalies or degradation in network\
    \ performance, as a limited\nnumber of congested links can be responsible for\
    \ signiﬁcant delays or high packet drop\nrates, and suggests utilizing CS theory\
    \ in order to identify these few entities based on end-\nto-end measurements.\
    \ Zheng et al. [74] provide an analysis of the capacity and delay of\ndata gathering\
    \ with compressive sensing in wireless sensor networks. The paper considers\n\
    a random topology where sensor nodes are randomly deployed in a region, for both\n\
    single-sink and multi-sink scenarios, and characterizes the capacity and delay\
    \ performance\nimprovement that the CS paradigm can achieve for data gathering.\
    \ In particular, for\nthe single sink, a simple routing scheme for data gathering\
    \ with CS is suggested, and\na tight capacity in the order sense is presented.\
    \ In particular, the suggested routing\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n13 of 44\nscheme\
    \ with pipelining scheduling algorithm for data gathering shows that the proposed\n\
    single-sink scheme can achieve a capacity gain of Θ( n\nM) over the baseline transmission\n\
    scheme, and the delay can be reduced by a factor of Θ(\n√\nnlogn\nM\n), where\
    \ M is the number\nof random projections required for reconstructing a snapshot,\
    \ and n is the number of\nrandomly deployed nodes. For the multi-sink case, their\
    \ architecture shows that the per-\nsession capacity of data gathering with CS\
    \ is Θ(\nn√nW\nMnd\n√\nnslogn), and the per-session delay is\nΘ(M\nq\nn\nlogn),\
    \ where W is the data rate. The number of sinks present in the network is nd,\n\
    and the number of randomly selected source nodes is ns. They validate the theoretical\n\
    results with simulations for the scaling laws of the capacity in both single-sink\
    \ and multi-\nsink networks.\n4. Medium Access Control (MAC)\nNext, we move to\
    \ the Data-Link layer and speciﬁcally to the medium access control\n(MAC) mechanism,\
    \ which highly affects the performance of data gathering protocols, as\nit inﬂuences\
    \ several performance aspects, such as reliability, latency, channel utilization,\n\
    power utilization (which impact the lifespan of a sensor in particular and the\
    \ network in\ngeneral), etc. Even though many access protocols were suggested\
    \ over the years for shared-\nchannel networks, wired and wireless, due to their\
    \ unique properties and requirements,\nextensive research has been conducted on\
    \ MAC protocols targeted to WSN. Many WSN\nMAC protocols were designed to comply\
    \ with various trafﬁc patterns. Accordingly, in the\nsequel, we provide a short\
    \ WSN-MAC protocol overview for ones that can support yet\nare not necessarily\
    \ particular to data-gathering. We review a fraction of the vast literature\n\
    on the topic and the numerous MAC protocols devised over the years. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ a\nschematic partition of the papers discussed throughout this section according\
    \ to the main\nMAC classes.\nMAC\nSection 4\nSynchronous \nTransmitter-Initiated\
    \ \nReceiver-Initiated \nAsynchronous \nOthers\nSection 4.2\nDuty-Cycle\nSection\
    \ 4.1\nFigure 3. Schematic description highlighting the main MAC classes covered\
    \ in the section.\nEnergy consumption is one of the main concerns of WSN, and\
    \ as previously explained,\nit needs to be considered in the design of protocols\
    \ and algorithms in all the layers of the\nprotocol stack. The highest energy\
    \ consumer of a sensor or an IoT device is its transceiver,\nwhich consumes energy\
    \ regardless of whether it is transmitting or only awake listening to\nongoing\
    \ trafﬁc (e.g., [75]). One of the more prevalent solutions to save power is to\
    \ embrace\na duty-cycle mechanism in which the device is asleep most of the time\
    \ (its transceiver is in\nlow power mode), and is awake for transmitting or receiving\
    \ data only a small fraction\nof the time. Another important aspect of wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSN) is channel\nutilization, that is, in a typical WSN, when\
    \ multiple devices are trying to send reports\nsimultaneously, air time is a crucial\
    \ network resource. Particularly when the network is\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    14 of 44\ndense with multiple devices in the same neighborhood, issues such as\
    \ coordinating between\nthe users to avoid collisions and preventing users from\
    \ occupying the channel for long\ntime intervals are fundamental. Note that such\
    \ issues can highly affect the performance in\na dense network topology even when\
    \ reports are not frequent. Accordingly, utilizing the\nchannel (air time) efﬁciently\
    \ is a crucial component for any such system’s operation and\nperformance. These\
    \ two highly vital aspects justify the signiﬁcance given to the design of\nmedium\
    \ access control (MAC) protocols that are particular to WSNs. Numerous protocols\n\
    have been suggested to cope with different WSN objectives and demands (e.g., [76,77]).\n\
    This paper focuses on MAC protocols for WSNs, particularly on duty-cycled-based\
    \ ones.\n4.1. Duty-Cycle MAC Protocols\nTraditionally, duty-cycle MAC protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed as either synchronous or\nasynchronous. In synchronous protocols\
    \ the awake time interval is synchronized such that\nall devices are awake (or\
    \ asleep) at the same time intervals (e.g., S-MAC [78], T-MAC [79]).\nSince the\
    \ awake time intervals are quite limited, they can be highly congested and prone\n\
    to collisions. Several synchronous protocols have devised mechanisms to attenuate\
    \ this\ncongestion and to allow more devices to transmit in each cycle, for example,\
    \ DW-MAC [80],\nwhich allocates the awake time for transmission reservations that\
    \ will be executed during\nthe sleep interval.\nIn asynchronous protocols, each\
    \ device has its own wake-up schedule. Accordingly,\nthe main challenge is setting\
    \ a rendezvous time when both the sender and the receiver are\nawake and devising\
    \ a signaling mechanism that informs both that they are awake and can\ncommunicate.\
    \ Asynchronous MAC protocols can further be divided into two categories,\ntransmitter-\
    \ or receiver-initiated. In transmitter-initiated protocols, the transmitter initiates\n\
    the transmission by capturing the channel waiting for its designated receiver\
    \ to wake\nup. For instance, in B-MAC [81], the transmitter transmits a long preamble\
    \ capturing the\nchannel prior to the data transmission, waiting for its intended\
    \ receiver to wake up and\nreply. In X-MAC [82], the transmitter transmits a sequence\
    \ of short preambles allowing\nthe intended receiver to interrupt, notifying the\
    \ receiver that it is awake. In WiseMAC [83],\nthe transmitter learns the wake-up\
    \ time of its intended receiver and starts the preamble\ntransmission just prior\
    \ to this wake-up time.\nThe second approach, the receiver-initiated paradigm,\
    \ relies on the receiver, whenever\nawake and ready to receive data, to initiate\
    \ the data exchange. The basic receiver-initiated\nMAC concept was introduced\
    \ in RI-MAC [84], in which whenever the receiver wakes up,\nit transmits a predeﬁned\
    \ preamble, signaling to its potential transmitters that it is awake\nand ready\
    \ to receive data. Several protocols took up the RI-MAC paradigm and suggested\n\
    modiﬁcations and enhancements. Some protocols strived to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    while a sender stays awake, waiting for its intended receiver to wake up. For\
    \ instance,\nPW-MAC [85] and AP-MAC [86] suggested that each transmitter will\
    \ learn its receiver’s\nexpected wake-up time, and instead of staying awake waiting\
    \ for its designated receiver to\nwake up, will wake up just before its intended\
    \ receiver’s wake-up instance.\nAnother receiver-initiated enhancement is suggested\
    \ by A-MAC [87], which aims to\nreduce the time in which a receiver and, consequently,\
    \ its potential transmitters stay awake,\nby trying to determine whether there\
    \ are pending packets for transmission and if it needs\nto stay awake or if it\
    \ can go back to sleep after probing the channel. The enhancement\nrelies on an\
    \ additional frame, termed “auto-ack”, sent by pending transmitters, which\nfollows\
    \ the receiver’s probe packet and proceeds with the data transmission. The “auto-ack”\n\
    frame is such that the receiver can decode a superposition of several such frames\
    \ and\ndetermine whether there is trafﬁc being sent. Even though the energy saved\
    \ per cycle is\nnegligible, the cumulative savings per day can be signiﬁcant due\
    \ to the numerous times\na device wakes up probing the channel. RIVER-MAC [88]\
    \ suggests two enhancements,\none aiming at reducing the awake time a sender is\
    \ waiting for its intended receiver to\nwake up, and one that aims at improving\
    \ the RI-MAC collision resolution mechanism by\nletting an active receiver keep\
    \ controlling the channel after invoking the collision resolution\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n15 of 44\nmechanism, and speciﬁcally during the silent backoff interval.\
    \ MAR-RiMAC [89] suggested\nan amendment to the receiver-initiated approach, and\
    \ in particular RI-MAC, to cope with\nthe perpetual collisions, common in dense\
    \ networks and heavy trafﬁc loads, in which\nmany devices are trying to transmit\
    \ to the same entity (sink or relay). MAR-RiMAC relies\non a reservation-based\
    \ mechanism in which the reservations are short signals that can\nbe transmitted\
    \ simultaneously. After the designated receiver decodes the identity of the\n\
    devices, it sends a transmission request and polls them sequentially, with no\
    \ idle intervals.\nAs mentioned in Section 2, relying on EH requires adaptations\
    \ that typically relate\nto the harvested energy source. For example, how to balance\
    \ the harvested energy and\nthe energy consumption can be a crucial factor in\
    \ whether or not a scheme or protocol\ncan be adopted by a network that relies\
    \ on EH, and can be the primary factor impacting\ntheir performance. Adaptation\
    \ requirements to support EH-based sensors span the whole\nnetwork stack, including\
    \ the MAC sublayer. Adaptation of receiver-initiated duty-cycle\nMAC protocol\
    \ for energy-harvesting-powered wireless sensor networks, in which besides\nthe\
    \ usual MAC challenges, both transmitter and receiver need to have sufﬁcient power\
    \ for\nsuccessful transmission, is given by Liu et al. [90].\n4.2. MAC Protocols\
    \ for Other Setups\nNext, we review some MAC protocols and MAC adaptations for\
    \ various setups,\nsuch as multi-channel, multi-radio, busy-tone utilization,\
    \ or different from the duty-cycle\napproach. DURI-MAC [91] adopts the traditional\
    \ busy-tone scheme and allocates a sub-\nchannel for control such that while receiving\
    \ data on the data channel, a busy signal\nis transmitted on the control channel,\
    \ which notiﬁes neighboring nodes of the ongoing\ntransmission, and therefore\
    \ helps avoid interference from hidden terminals. EM-MAC [92]\nutilizes multiple\
    \ orthogonal radio channels and allows devices to dynamically select the\nchannels\
    \ for their transmissions based on the channel conditions they sense without the\n\
    utilization of a control channel. Accordingly, EM-MAC can avoid using channels\
    \ that are\ncurrently heavily loaded, inferior due to interference, or jammed.\
    \ Typically, the trafﬁc\nload sent by a node is spatially and temporally variable.\
    \ Different nodes need to send\ndifferent trafﬁc loads due to their tasks, topological\
    \ location, and the amount of trafﬁc they\nneed to relay. Furthermore, the same\
    \ node can experience different loads at different time\nintervals due to events\
    \ or requests triggering different trafﬁc loads. Accordingly, several\nstudies\
    \ have explored an adaptive duty-cycle approach. For example, Ye and Zhang [93]\n\
    have developed a reinforcement-learning-based self-adaptive sleep/wake-up scheduling\n\
    approach. In the proposed method, each node (device) divides the time into time-slots,\n\
    which are not necessarily synchronized between neighboring nodes. Each node decides\n\
    whether to sleep or wake up in each time slot, and while awake, it decides whether\
    \ to listen\nor transmit. The decision is based on its current situation and its\
    \ estimation of its neighbors’\nsituations and is attained via Q-learning.\nGamm\
    \ et al. [94] devise an alternative approach to duty-cycle, which utilizes two\n\
    radios: the primary radio transceiver and an additional wake-up radio (WuR). The\
    \ wake-up\nradio is a low-power receiver triggered by an external event and can\
    \ turn on the main\ntransceiver when required. Oller et al. [95] provide a detailed\
    \ characterization of a speciﬁc\nWuR, the SubCarrier Modulation WuR (SCM-WuR),\
    \ through physical experiments and\nmeasurements, evaluating it for different\
    \ performance metrics and comparing it to other\nwake-up radio-based systems.\
    \ The authors of [95] model and simulate their own designed\nWuR hardware platform,\
    \ which is compared to four widely employed MAC protocols for\nWSN under three\
    \ real-world network deployments [96]. Spenza et al. [97] further design\nand\
    \ prototype a very-low-power-consumption (<1.3 µW), high-sensitivity (up to −55\
    \ dBm),\nfast-reactivity (wake-up time of 130 µs), and selective-addressing wake-up\
    \ receiver (WRx)\nand describe its integration to a wireless sensor node. The\
    \ authors leverage their WRx and\npresent ALBA-WUR, a cross-layer solution for\
    \ data gathering in wireless sensing systems.\nSimilar to duty-cycled MAC protocols,\
    \ wake-up radio-based protocols also distinguish\nbetween transmitter-initiated\
    \ WuR (TI-WuR) protocols in which the transmitter wakes up\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 2650\n16 of 44\nits potential receivers (e.g., [98,99]) vs. receiver-initiated\
    \ WuR (RI-WuR) that adopt the\nRI-MAC paradigm such that when a receiving node\
    \ is ready to collect data, it wakes up all\nthe nodes in its neighborhood by\
    \ broadcasting a wake-up call (e.g., [100,101]).\nAn energy-harvesting-based MAC\
    \ protocol for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is\nsuggested by Hawa et al. [102],\
    \ in which the secondary users (SUs) utilize the transmis-\nsions by primary users\
    \ (PUs) to harvest energy. Accordingly, the suggested protocol\ninterlaces SUs’\
    \ data transmissions within these PUs’ transmission holes. The proposed\nenergy-harvesting/data-transmission\
    \ schedule considers the imbalance between the small\namount of energy collected\
    \ per PU’s transmission and the energy required by an SU\ndata transmission.\n\
    Next, we mention several WSN MAC protocols that were specially designed for\n\
    particular data-gathering setups in WSN and IoT networks, exploiting the special\
    \ associ-\nated attributes (e.g., that the trafﬁc patterns are always from sensors\
    \ to the sink, or that\nthere exists a set of predeﬁned messages that need to\
    \ be sent). Cohen et al. [103] design\nand analyze a data collection protocol\
    \ based on information theoretic principles. In the\nsuggested protocol, each\
    \ sensor needs to convey one out of a bank of known messages\nto a sink. The protocol\
    \ assumes a large population of sensors and devises a scheme in\nwhich a sink\
    \ (or relay) can simultaneously collect messages from up to K sensors, without\n\
    knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without requiring any synchroniza-\n\
    tion, coordination, or management overhead. D-3 [104] exploits the fact that the\
    \ trafﬁc in\ndata-gathering applications ﬂows in a certain direction (toward a\
    \ single or multiple sinks)\nto devise a wake-up that can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ end-to-end delay. Speciﬁcally, D-3 lays\nout the awake schedule of communicating\
    \ nodes such that a packet can be forwarded\ntoward its destination sequentially,\
    \ without the need for a node to wait for its next-hop\nrelay to wake up (i.e.,\
    \ the wake-up schedule is such that a relay wakes up in time to receive\na packet\
    \ just received by its predecessor).\n5. Routing for Data Gathering in WSN\nWe\
    \ keep climbing the layers, and in this section we address issues related to the\n\
    Network layer. We start with a short review of WSN routing protocols. We note\
    \ that\nrouting-related aspects were also referred to in other sections of this\
    \ survey. We mainly\nfocus on the prominent and more recent protocols. We do not\
    \ provide a comprehensive\nreview of routing protocols in multihop WSNs and mainly\
    \ explore routing protocols\nsuitable for data gathering. Figure 4 provides a\
    \ schematic distribution of the discussed\npapers into main topics. As with the\
    \ schematic partition in the other sections, in order\nnot to have too many, the\
    \ topics are chosen such that the theme on each one encompasses\nseveral papers.\
    \ The papers’ partition is rough: some papers can appear in more than one\ntopic\
    \ while others are only related to the topic.\nWe start with general WSN settings\
    \ and then continue with routing protocols under\nenergy harvesting constraints.\
    \ Then we explore the utilization of network coding for data\ngathering, which\
    \ leverages the multi-hop routing, allowing relays (intermediate nodes)\nto code\
    \ the incoming packets before forwarding them toward the sink. We conclude this\n\
    section by examining a different paradigm. Rather than utilizing the traditional\
    \ approach of\nforwarding the sensed data via multiple relay nodes before reaching\
    \ the sink, this paradigm\nrelies on a Mobile Sink (MS) that traverses the network\
    \ and collects the sensed data from\nthe sensors it passes through.\n5.1. Common\
    \ WSN Routing Protocols for Data Gathering\nThe common setup for a data collection\
    \ network comprises a set of devices (e.g.,\nsensors) and one or multiple sinks\
    \ that collect the reports. In many such scenarios, the\nsensors are unevenly\
    \ dispersed over the terrain and in some cases can be mobile, can have\na different\
    \ distance to the sink(s), and the data needs to traverse multiple hops before\n\
    reaching the sink, in which commonly the sensors themselves serve as relays toward\n\
    the sink. Consequently, the performance experienced by different sensors (e.g.,\
    \ energy\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n17 of 44\nconsumption, latency, reliability)\
    \ can be markedly diverse. Various solutions, including\nenergy-aware routing,\
    \ compressed sensing, efﬁcient MAC novelties and architectural\ninnovations, have\
    \ been suggested to try to improve the overall performance and to balance\nits\
    \ variability; many are scattered throughout this survey under different subjects\
    \ (e.g.,\nSections 3, 4 and 6). In the sequel, we provide a brief review of routing\
    \ protocols for WSN\nin general and data gathering in particular.\nRouting\nSection\

    \ Cluster-Based Routing Protocols\nA signiﬁcant milestone in WSN routing protocols\
    \ is the low-energy adaptive clustering\nhierarchy (LEACH) protocol [105]. The\
    \ basic LEACH protocol is an adaptive clustering-\nbased protocol that dynamically\
    \ selects sensor nodes as cluster-heads. Each cluster-head\naggregates data from\
    \ its cluster members and relays it to the sink. In order to distribute\nthe high\
    \ energy consumption imposed on cluster-heads between all the sensor nodes,\n\
    the cluster-heads are dynamically selected according to a predeﬁned probability\
    \ that\ndepends on the number of desired clusters. The resulting protocol causes\
    \ continuous\nclustering hierarchy reelection, which facilitates energy balancing.\
    \ The original version\npresented by Heinzelman et al. [105] considers a setup\
    \ in which all sensor nodes can\ndirectly communicate with the sink; hence, each\
    \ cluster-head can directly relay the collected\ninformation from its cluster\
    \ members to the sink. However, as described in the paper,\nLEACH can be easily\
    \ extended to a hierarchical cluster setup in which the cluster-head\nnodes of\
    \ each tier are also organized in clusters such that each cluster-head relays\
    \ its\naggregated data to its higher-layer cluster-head, and so on up to the top\
    \ layer of the\nhierarchy, at which point the data are sent to the sink.\nSince\
    \ its publication in 2000, numerous protocols have relied on LEACH’s clustering\n\
    paradigm, suggesting enhancements and improvements for various setups and require-\n\
    ments. For instance, EE-LEACH [106,107] aims at improving the energy efﬁciency\
    \ of\nLEACH by considering the sensor’s residual energy throughout the stages\
    \ of the proto-\ncol. Speciﬁcally, EE-LEACH assumes that node deployment is implemented\
    \ according\nto a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. It forms clusters and\
    \ selects their respective\ncluster-heads based on the residual energy of neighboring\
    \ nodes. The relay nodes that\nforward the data aggregated by cluster-heads to\
    \ the sink are selected based on their residual\nenergy. A clustering procedure\
    \ based on recursive rectangular partitioning of the network\ngrid following the\
    \ k-d tree algorithm is demonstrated by Anzola et al. [108]. The authors\nadjust\
    \ a protocol that combines their clustering methods and report that it performs\
    \ better\nthan LEACH. Several surveys have summarized the successors of the LEACH\
    \ protocol\n(e.g., [107]).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n18 of 44\nPEGASIS [109] was\
    \ designed to address the overhead resulting from the cluster\nformation in LEACH.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, PEGASIS replaces the clusters with a node-chain in which\neach\
    \ node receives the data from its predecessor and transmits it to its successor\
    \ in the chain.\nThe data is gathered while getting fused along the chain until\
    \ eventually, a designated\nnode transmits it to the sink. PEGASIS relies on nodes\
    \ having global knowledge of the\nnetwork and shows that a simple greedy algorithm\
    \ for the forwarding chain construction,\nin which nodes select their closest\
    \ neighbors as the next hops in the chain, is sufﬁcient to\nsigniﬁcantly reduce\
    \ energy consumption. Similar to LEACH, and in order to balance the\nenergy depletion\
    \ in the network, different nodes transmit the fused data to the sink on\neach\
    \ data-gathering round. P-LEACH [110] offers a hybrid between LEACH and PEGASIS\n\
    that relies on cluster formation where cluster-heads collect and forward trafﬁc.\
    \ Rather\nthan forward the trafﬁc directly to the sink, or create a hierarchical\
    \ cluster setup in which\ncluster-heads are also grouped into clusters with another\
    \ cluster-head, P-LEACH adopts\nchain-based forwarding such that the cluster-heads\
    \ are arranged in a chain along which\nthe collected data is forwarded, as suggested\
    \ by PEGASIS.\nSeveral LEACH enhancements have relied on bio-inspired algorithms.\
    \ For example,\nSiew et al. [111] utilize adaptive particle swarm optimization\
    \ (APSO). This widely used\nswarm intelligence method mimics swarming behavior\
    \ in bird ﬂocking and ﬁsh schooling\nto guide its members to search for globally\
    \ optimal solutions for cluster-head location\nselection. Tam et al. [112] extend\
    \ LEACH to a 3D setting by employing a method based on\nfuzzy clustering and particle\
    \ swarm optimization (PSO). Cui et al. [113] suggest a variant\nof the bat algorithm,\
    \ which simulates bat prey echolocation behavior, to optimize the\ncluster-head\
    \ selection for LEACH protocol. A routing path selection using an ant colony\n\
    optimization algorithm is presented by Jiang and Zheng [114]. Clustering by mimicking\n\
    groups of yellow goatﬁsh is discussed by Rodríguez et al. [115]. The authors claim\
    \ that\nthe presented meta-heuristic is more efﬁcient in avoiding local minima.\
    \ An extension of\nLEACH for an IoT-designated industrial environment is presented\
    \ by Karunanithy and\nVelusamy [116]. This work provides uniform CH selection,\
    \ uniform CH dispersion over\nthe industrial grid of IoT-based sensors, and tree-based\
    \ routing selection that promises to\nbe more energy efﬁcient than known counterparts.\
    \ The energy exploitation is claimed to be\nequal among nodes.\nMehmood et al.\
    \ [117] devise a dynamic-size cluster-based routing protocol for WSN\ncomprising\
    \ a large number of sensors that are spread over a large area (the paper suggests\n\
    pollution monitoring as a candidate application). The primary objective of the\
    \ presented\nscheme is to effectively select CHs to be responsible for the main\
    \ communication with BS\nand additionally deﬁned chief nodes (CNs). Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the sensor topology is divided\ninto groups, where CNs collect the updated energy\
    \ indications of other sensors within a\ngroup. There are also border nodes responsible\
    \ for communication between groups. If\ntheir energy value drops below a threshold,\
    \ the CNs can be reelected. The candidates for\nCNs and CHs are provided by an\
    \ artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which takes as inputs\nremaining energy, neighboring\
    \ node count, the amount of outstanding data, signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR), distances\
    \ between nodes, CHs, CNs and the BS, trafﬁc load, and so\non. The simulations\
    \ show a better lifetime than other selected known protocols; hence,\nthe scheme\
    \ is a better ﬁt for pollution monitoring. Clustering and routing for a wind\n\
    turbine system monitored by WSN are introduced by Durairaj and Selvaraj [118].\
    \ The\ndiscussed environment is unique because sensors placed at wind turbines\
    \ can have their\nenergy replenished by the turbine itself; hence, these sensors\
    \ are always assumed to be\ncharged. However, the distances between turbines and\
    \ the BS are too large, and the\ngrid is augmented by ground sensors that relay\
    \ the measurements. In many cases, these\nground sensors have to act as CHs. The\
    \ authors propose system partitioning and clustering\nmethods that may be hierarchical\
    \ to speciﬁcally address this scenario. An interesting\nalgorithm that also employs\
    \ partitioning, by hierarchical grouping of sensors based on\nearly knowledge\
    \ of geographical transmission patterns in mobile WSN, is presented by\nShifrin\
    \ and Cidon [119].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n19 of 44\n5.1.2. Opportunistic Routing\n\
    The opportunistic routing approach, which was designed for wireless networks,\
    \ dy-\nnamically chooses paths toward the destination on a per-transmission basis,\
    \ Biswas and\nMorris [120], Ye and Hua [121]. Opportunistic routing exploits the\
    \ broadcast nature of\nwireless communication jointly with the spatial diversity\
    \ of distributed nodes in a given\nroute such that multiple nodes overhear each\
    \ packet transmitted by a node. The node that\nreceives the packet successfully\
    \ and can serve as the best relay toward the destination (e.g.,\nclosest to the\
    \ destination) becomes the next transmitting node. Harnessing opportunistic\n\
    routing to duty-cycle MAC protocols encounters several obstacles. In synchronous\
    \ duty-\ncycle MAC protocols (Section 4), the short time duration in which all\
    \ nodes are awake (and\nspeciﬁcally, all the potential relays are awake and trying\
    \ to forward the same packet) can\nlead to artiﬁcial congestion and poor wake-time\
    \ utilization. In asynchronous duty-cycle\nMAC protocols, since not all nodes\
    \ are awake simultaneously, the use of overhearing, which\nopportunistic routing\
    \ relies on, is limited and requires adaptations such that the transmitter\nwill\
    \ transmit to multiple relays upon its wake-up (e.g., [122]) or delay its transmission,\n\
    choosing its relay opportunistically based on channel condition (e.g., [123]).\n\
    In a dense WSN, even under asynchronous duty-cycle MAC protocol, several potential\n\
    relays can be awake simultaneously, which poses additional challenges when utilizing\n\
    opportunistic routing. In addition to the relay selection problem—whether a transmitter\n\
    should wait for the best relay to wake up or compromise on a less preferable relay,\
    \ reducing\nits awake period and how long it should wait—it also encounters the\
    \ collision avoidance\nproblem between simultaneously awake nodes. Liu et al.\
    \ [124] suggest a slotted contention-\nbased scheme in which, following a probe\
    \ sent by the transmitter, the awakened potential\nrelays contend and transmit\
    \ feedback concerning the routing progress they can offer. The\ntransmitter selects\
    \ the best possible relay out of the ones that replied, taking into account\n\
    not only the metric chosen to evaluate the different relays, but also the waiting\
    \ time of\nthe link-layer transmissions. Under a similar set-up of dense asynchronous\
    \ duty-cycle\nMAC protocol with multiple potential relays awake simultaneously,\
    \ Hawbani et al. [125]\ntry to control the number of potential forwarders, which\
    \ inﬂuences both the transmitter\nwaiting time and the number of packet duplications.\
    \ The suggested solution relies on\na two-step mechanism. First, each transmitter\
    \ determines a candidate zone such that all\nnodes within the candidate zone are\
    \ potential forwarders. Second, the candidates within\nthe candidate zone are\
    \ prioritized based on a combination of metrics that considers residual\nenergy,\
    \ transmitting direction, distance, and link quality.\n5.1.3. Routing Protocol\
    \ for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)\nA routing protocol for low-power and\
    \ lossy networks (RPL) is a routing protocol\nthat was speciﬁcally designed for\
    \ networks composed of constrained nodes, which are\ninterconnected via unstable\
    \ and lossy links with relatively low packet delivery rates and\ntypically only\
    \ support low data rates (hence, low-power and lossy networks (LLNs)).\nSpeciﬁcally,\
    \ RPL is a distance-vector proactive routing protocol designed for IPv6 low-\n\
    power devices with limited energy, processing, and memory resources (Winter et\
    \ al. [126]).\nRPL constructs a tree routing topology termed the destination-oriented\
    \ directed acyclic\ngraph (DODAG), rooted at one or more sink nodes. The routing\
    \ tree (graph), along\nwhich the trafﬁc traverses, is constructed according to\
    \ an objective function (OF) that can\nutilize a set of metrics such as energy\
    \ consumption, latency, and hop count. The most\ncommon ones are OF0, which ﬁnds\
    \ the shortest path (the path with the minimal hop-count)\nto the sink (Thubert\
    \ et al. [127]), and minimum rank with hysteresis objective function\n(MRHOF),\
    \ which ﬁnds the routes that minimize the link cost associated with the routes\n\
    (Gnawali and Levis [128]). The cost is deﬁned as the latency metric allowing RPL\
    \ to ﬁnd\nstable minimum-latency paths from each node to the sink, or it can be\
    \ associated with the\nexpected transmission count (ETX) metric, which allows\
    \ RPL to ﬁnd the stable minimum-\nETX paths from the nodes to the sink (the default\
    \ metric). In order to achieve stability,\nMRHOF also ensures that a route is\
    \ changed (a node exchanges its preferred parent in\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    20 of 44\nthe routing tree) only if the cost of the improved route is better than\
    \ the current route by\nat least a predeﬁned threshold. RPL is the de-facto IPv6-based\
    \ routing protocol for the\nIoT. Accordingly, several OFs and possible enhancements\
    \ have emerged during recent\nyears, and several performance evaluations and comparisons\
    \ have been presented. In the\nfollowing, we discuss some of these OFs.\nAbdel\
    \ Hakeem et al. [129] analyze the performance of RPL in collecting smart meter\n\
    readings over smart grid (SG) networks via Java-based simulations and IoT-LAB\
    \ testbed ex-\nperiments. Speciﬁcally, Ref. [129] evaluates the RPL performance\
    \ under the two prominent\nobjective functions Hop Count and ETX, in terms of\
    \ packet delivery ratio, network latency,\ncontrol trafﬁc overhead, and power\
    \ consumption. Barnawi et al. [130] utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to examine\
    \ the performance of RPL under duty-cycle MAC protocol.\nSpeciﬁcally, Ref. [130]\
    \ simulates RPL over the classical XMAC protocol and its derivative\nContikiMac,\
    \ where, rather than using a long preamble waiting for the receiver to wake up,\n\
    the sender repeatedly sends the same packet until a link layer acknowledgment\
    \ is received.\nAs a baseline, Ref. [130] uses NullRDC, an always-awake node.\
    \ As expected, the results\nshow that NullRDC is better in terms of latency, while\
    \ ContikiMac outperforms the others\nin terms of power consumption. Al-Shargabi\
    \ and Aleswid [131] also utilize the Cooja\nnetwork simulator to evaluate which\
    \ OF is more suitable for a WSN in healthcare scenarios.\nOF0 and ETX are examined\
    \ in various network topologies, such as the grid and random\ntopology, under\
    \ diverse densities. They conclude that the OF0 is more efﬁcient with respect\n\
    to packet delivery ratio (PDR) and power consumption in the random topology setup.\n\
    Sousa et al. [132] propose an energy-efﬁcient and path-reliability-aware objective\n\
    function (ERAOF). The OF suggested by ERAOF linearly combines energy consumption\n\
    and link quality (in terms of ETX) routing metrics. Even though the selected routes\
    \ are\nnot optimal in either one of the objective metrics, they provide a balance\
    \ between energy\nefﬁciency and reliability. Rafea and Kadhim [133] suggest an\
    \ energy threshold RPL (ETRPL),\nwhich, in addition to the ETX metric, incorporates\
    \ in its objective function the remaining\nenergy of the preferred forwarding\
    \ (parent) node. ETRPL performance is evaluated via\nCooja simulator. Sharma et\
    \ al. [134] suggest another MRHOF-based objective function that\ntakes into account\
    \ three routing metrics: ETX, energy, and delay. Energy consumption,\nin order\
    \ to increase the lifespan of the network, is also considered by Sankar et al.\
    \ [135],\nwhich suggests cluster-tree-based routing protocol to maximize the lifetime\
    \ of IoT (CT-\nRPL). As the name suggests, CT-RPL is a cluster-based routing protocol\
    \ that involves three\nprocesses: cluster formation, cluster-head selection, and\
    \ route establishment. CT-RPL ﬁrst\nscans the nodes and group (cluster) nodes\
    \ whose Euclidean distance from their centroid\npoint is bounded, adding one node\
    \ at a time. Next, each cluster selects its cluster-head\n(CH), utilizing a game-theoretic\
    \ approach in which the node with the maximum payoff\n“p” value—which considers\
    \ parameters such as residual energy, sensing energy, receiving\nenergy, aggregation\
    \ energy, and transmission energy—is selected as the CH node for each\nround.\
    \ Finally, the route is established using the metrics residual energy ratio (RER),\
    \ queue\nutilization (QU), and expected transmission count (ETX).\nAnother RPL\
    \ enhancement termed weighted random forward RPL (WRF-RPL) is\nproposed by Acevedo\
    \ et al. [136]. WRF-RPL suggests a load balancing over RPL mechanism,\nwhich distributes\
    \ the trafﬁc between multiple transmission paths, trying to avoid one\npreferred\
    \ parent’s congestions. WRF-RPL OF relies on the composition of two metrics, the\n\
    remaining energy and the count of parent nodes, where the latter aims at prioritizing\
    \ parent\nnodes with more optional paths to the destination. Forwarding decisions\
    \ are probabilistic\naccording to the deﬁned metric, such that nodes with a higher\
    \ number of parents or hops\nare more likely to be selected than others. The authors\
    \ utilize the Cooja simulator for\nevaluation. Rojas et al. [137] leverage a wired\
    \ data center network labeling protocol to\nsuggest IoTorii, a routing protocol\
    \ for LLNs. IoTorii supports multiple paths between\nsender and receiver, and\
    \ requires fewer table entries and control messages, with similar\nperformance\
    \ compared to the standard RPL.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n21 of 44\nMolnár [138]\
    \ provides a graph-theoretic solution to the general problem of QoS-\nconstrained\
    \ routing in WSN that relies on RPL. The authors stress the difference between\n\
    multi-objective optimization and multi-constrained problem setting. Vera-Pérez\
    \ et al. [139]\nexamine the integration of RPL to IEEE 802.15.4e with time-slotted\
    \ channel-hopping (TSCH)\nmedium access mechanism. In particular, Ref. [139] characterizes\
    \ the long deployment\ndelays required for such networks to become operational\
    \ and able to start exchanging data\nmessages. The article proposes an analytical\
    \ model that estimates the average time that the\nsynchronization process can\
    \ take for a new node to join a TSCH-based network, as well as\nan estimation\
    \ of the maximum time required for the formation of a complete network of\nthis\
    \ kind, and the additional time required to set the RPL-based routes. The paper\
    \ validates\nthe analytical model via simulations. A recent comprehensive survey\
    \ on routing protocols\nfor LLN networks in IoT (not exclusive to RPL) can be\
    \ found in [140].\n5.2. Data Aggregation Routing Protocols for Energy Harvesting\
    \ WSN\nAs discussed in Section 2, an alternative for relying on batteries as the\
    \ source of energy,\nwith their imposed constraints (e.g., size, replacement,\
    \ etc.), is to embrace energy-harvesting\n(EH) technology. However, as mentioned\
    \ earlier, relying on EH imposes different con-\nstraints and limitations. Such\
    \ constraints can make battery-reliant schemes impractical\nwhen devising data\
    \ collection procedures. When battery-reliant schemes are applied to\nEH-based\
    \ platforms, performance can be highly degraded. Speciﬁcally, relying on EH can\n\
    induce high diversity between the different nodes, as different nodes can have\
    \ different\nattributes, such as energy depletion and charging rates, which affect\
    \ the nodes’ availability;\nin addition, different nodes can have different roles,\
    \ such as different reporting rates or\ndifferent report importance, requiring\
    \ more energy usage, which eventually also affects the\nnodes’ availability. When\
    \ a sensor is expected to transmit or receive a report, it needs to\nhave sufﬁcient\
    \ energy to complete the transaction; therefore, reliance on EH needs to be\n\
    considered when designing a scheduling protocol. For example, a data collection\
    \ scheme\nthat relies on EH should adapt the report rate to energy availability;\
    \ it can compromise\nthe rate of less important reports coming from the sensors\
    \ to leave them sufﬁcient energy\nfor emergency reports. It can prioritize sensors\
    \ with more energy over those with lower\nenergy, especially when there is some\
    \ redundancy in the reports received by different\nsensors. This is especially\
    \ so when dealing with multi-hop routing, where many of the\nnodes serve as relays\
    \ and have the burden to stay awake longer, to receive and transmit\nmore, which\
    \ escalates the heterogeneity of the nodes and accentuates the difference in\n\
    importance between the different nodes. Furthermore, if on a single-hop network,\
    \ we\ncould rely on the receiver (sink) to have unlimited power (connected to\
    \ a power source), in\nmulti-hop topologies also, the receivers rely on EH; hence,\
    \ when scheduling a transmission,\nwe need to ensure that both transmitter and\
    \ receiver have sufﬁcient power to complete the\ntransaction. In the following,\
    \ we present several routing protocol adaptations for EH-WSN\nin the context of\
    \ data aggregation.\nThe typical setup considers that each node (sensor) encompasses\
    \ an energy har-\nvester and an energy storage device and is solely powered by\
    \ the renewable energy\navailable to it by its energy storage device. A multi-hop\
    \ topology is considered such\nthat the data from many of the sensors need to\
    \ traverse multiple links before reaching the\nsink. Jeong et al. [141] propose\
    \ an adaptive data aggregation scheme for energy-harvesting\nWSNs. The suggested\
    \ scheme relies on two residual-energy thresholds, lower and upper.\nEach node\
    \ periodically estimates its residual energy level to determine whether or not\
    \ to\ntransmit data. When the node’s residual energy is either above the upper\
    \ threshold or\nbelow the lower threshold, the node transmits its aggregated data.\
    \ If its energy is below\nthe lower threshold, the node enters energy-saving mode\
    \ after transmitting the data. Its\nradio is turned off, and it waits to regain\
    \ sufﬁcient energy before turning its radio back\non. In normal operation mode,\
    \ where the residual energy is between the two thresholds,\nthe node only aggregates\
    \ data received from other nodes and collects its own sensed data.\nIf a node’s\
    \ aggregated data in normal mode exceeds its storage limit, the node transmits\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n22 of 44\nthe data regardless of its residual energy.\
    \ While this scheme is clear and straightforward\nto implement, it lacks latency\
    \ evaluation and a discussion about rendezvous between a\ntransmitter and a receiver.\n\
    Chen et al. [142] experimentally show that in energy-harvesting-based wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks (EH-WSNs), the required nodes’ charging time to be ready to\
    \ receive or send a\npacket is much greater than the time required for the contention\
    \ resolution mechanism and\ndominates the data aggregation latency. In addition\
    \ to the common collision deﬁnitions, the\npaper deﬁnes an “energy-collision”,\
    \ which occurs due to battery level constraint and not\ndue to simultaneous transmissions.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, energy-collision occurs when a transmitter-\nreceiver tuple is\
    \ scheduled for transmission, but the transmission cannot take place because\n\
    at least one of the two nodes has insufﬁcient energy to transmit or receive the\
    \ packet due\nto recent activity (insufﬁcient time has elapsed since its last\
    \ transmission or reception to\nharvest enough energy for the subsequent scheduled\
    \ transmission). An adaptable data\naggregation tree is constructed, which considers\
    \ each node’s residual and harvested energy,\nand three energy-collision-aware\
    \ data aggregation algorithms are proposed.\n5.2.1. Cluster-Based Routing Protocol\
    \ That Relies on EH\nSeveral studies have suggested various adaptations for LEACH\
    \ WSN cluster-based\nrouting protocol (e.g., [106]) for EH-based WSN (EH-WSN).\
    \ Recall that LEACH’s cluster-\nhead selection mechanism randomly selects sensor\
    \ nodes as cluster-heads to distribute\nthe energy consumption between them evenly,\
    \ which can seemingly cope with the EH\nconstraints. However, note that even when\
    \ the nodes’ platform is exactly the same, the\npotential of different nodes to\
    \ harvest energy, dependent on their speciﬁc ambient con-\nditions, can be very\
    \ different. Furthermore, the node’s location with respect to the sink\ncan highly\
    \ inﬂuence the amount of data it needs to relay toward the sink, causing high\n\
    discrepancies between the energy utilized by various nodes. To cope with these\
    \ discrepan-\ncies, Xiao et al. [143] modify LEACH’s cluster-head selection mechanism\
    \ and deﬁne a new\nmetric termed “energy potential function” to measure each node’s\
    \ capability to harvest\nenergy. The paper devises a cluster-head selection strategy\
    \ that prioritizes nodes with\nhigher expected stored energy (based on the currently\
    \ available energy and their potential\nenergy) to become cluster-heads, regardless\
    \ of the number of instances that the node was\nselected as cluster-head in the\
    \ past.\nTo address the imbalance between the energy expected to be consumed by\
    \ cluster-\nheads (CHs) that are closer to the sink and are expected to spend\
    \ more energy on relaying\npackets from farther clusters, and CHs that are further\
    \ from the sink and expected to relay\nless trafﬁc, Wu et al. [144] suggest an\
    \ unbalanced clustering mechanism. In particular,\ncluster sizes are determined\
    \ according to the distance (hop count) to the sink to balance the\nenergy consumption\
    \ of the CHs. Accordingly, clusters closer to the sink, which are expected\nto\
    \ relay more inter-cluster trafﬁc, will be smaller, so that they collect less\
    \ intra-cluster\ntrafﬁc; clusters further away from the sink and expected to relay\
    \ less inter-cluster trafﬁc\nwill comprise more nodes, so that they collect more\
    \ intra-cluster trafﬁc. The mechanism\nsuggested to attain this balance is partitioning\
    \ the network conceptually into concentric\nrings around the sink with linearly\
    \ increasing radii. Each ring comprises nodes with\nthe same hop distance to the\
    \ sink. Clusters within the same ring will have the same\nsize. CH selection is\
    \ designed to balance the loads of each ring considering the available\nnodes’\
    \ energy, which is evaluated based on the EH rate. Following a similar approach,\n\
    Yang et al. [145] assume a highly symmetric circular sensor network in which the\
    \ sink\n(BS) is located at the center, and the sensors are distributed evenly\
    \ in a disc around it.\nAs with [144], the sensor ﬁeld is divided into concentric\
    \ rings; however, in this study,\nthe rings are determined to have an equal area\
    \ such that the number of sensors in each\nring is expected to be the same. Under\
    \ the given model, Ref. [145] analyzes the energy\nconsumption of intra- and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmission and derives the energy neutrality\nconstraints, which guarantee\
    \ that each node consumes less energy than the amount of\nenergy it has harvested.\
    \ The authors further devise a constraint formula of the number of\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 2650\n23 of 44\nclusters required in each layer (ring) that balances the\
    \ average energy consumption of nodes\nin different layers. The energy neutrality\
    \ constraints and the cluster parameters are used to\nobtain the parameters (number\
    \ of rings, number of clusters in each ring, and minimum\nnetwork data transmission\
    \ cycle) that minimize the data transmission cycle. Based on the\nattained parameters,\
    \ the cluster-based routing protocol is derived. The protocol consists\nof an\
    \ initialization phase and repeated cycles divided into topology formation and\
    \ data-\ngathering phases. Bahbahani and Alsusa [146] suggest two separate enhancements.\
    \ The\nﬁrst, termed cooperative transmission strategy, enables nodes to serve\
    \ as relays to relay\nundelivered packets from cluster members to CHs and from\
    \ CHs to the sink node. The\nsecond mechanism, termed cluster-head duty-cycle,\
    \ regulates the frequency at which a node\ncan become a CH based on duty-cycling\
    \ that adapts to the node’s energy-harvesting rate.\nTo conserve the energy of\
    \ nodes that are more susceptible to energy depletion,\nBozorgi et al. [147] select\
    \ CHs, taking into account their residual energy, expected har-\nvest energy,\
    \ distance from the sink, number of neighbors, and, similar to LEACH, the\nnumber\
    \ of times a node has already served as a CH in the past. The proposed approach,\n\
    which combines centralized and distributed mechanisms, relies on a signal transmitted\n\
    by the sink that can be received by all the nodes, which allows them to estimate\
    \ their\ngeographic distance from the sink. The network is partitioned by the\
    \ sink into four layers\nbased on distance. The sink further computes the individual\
    \ coverage radius of each node\n(potential CH) based on distance (nodes closer\
    \ to the sink, which are therefore expected\nto relay trafﬁc coming from more\
    \ distant clusters, will have a smaller radius, and thus\nless intra-cluster trafﬁc;\
    \ on the other hand, nodes farther away from the sink, which are\ntherefore expected\
    \ to have less inter-cluster trafﬁc to relay, are assigned a longer radius,\n\
    and therefore more intra-cluster trafﬁc). The paper suggests a distributed contention-based\n\
    mechanism for selecting the CHs in which the contention window takes into account\
    \ the\nparameters mentioned above. Another cluster-based routing for EH-WSN is\
    \ proposed by\nRen and Yao [148]. The proposed routing scheme is divided into\
    \ cluster establishment and\ndata collection. It is suggested that besides the\
    \ typical cluster members (CMs) and cluster-\nhead (CH), a new entity be devised,\
    \ termed in the paper scheduling node (SN), which is\ndifferent from the CH. The\
    \ main task of the SN is to monitor the energy of all the cluster\nmembers during\
    \ the data collection stage and select a CH based on the monitored residual\n\
    energy of the cluster members. The transmission range of nodes can also be adjusted\
    \ based\non their residual energy. The data collection stage, which adapts a round-based\
    \ scheme\nsimilar to LEACH, is divided into the data transmission and CH selection\
    \ stages.\nSinde et al. [149] aim to improve the network efﬁciency by three means:\
    \ (i) clusteriza-\ntion mechanism that takes into account energy consumption during\
    \ the data aggregation\nphase, (ii) duty cycle adaptation of each node such that\
    \ each sensor node determines its\nmode of operation, and (iii) routing mechanism\
    \ based on ant colony optimization that\nchooses the path between the source and\
    \ the sink node that reduces the delay incurred.\nOverall, while the paper jointly\
    \ addresses several topics in WSN, including those connected\nto energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data gathering, its main contribution is the detailed NS3 simulation.\n5.2.2.\
    \ Mobile Charger\nToday’s technology enables dedicated wireless charging equipment\
    \ (WCE) to recharge\nthe nodes’ batteries, prolonging the lifetime of wireless\
    \ rechargeable sensor networks.\nA model in which, in addition to the sink (base\
    \ station), a mobile station will navigate\nthrough the WSN to collect data and\
    \ charge sensor nodes is considered by Liu et al. [150].\nThe paper suggests a\
    \ joint routing and charging strategy. The joint problem is decomposed\ninto two\
    \ sub-optimization problems: routing tree optimization and charging path optimiza-\n\
    tion. Heuristic algorithms based on simulated annealing algorithms were applied\
    \ to solve\nthese sub-optimization problems.\nA joint charging and routing algorithm\
    \ with WCE-assisted data gathering is also\nsuggested by Lu et al. [151]. The\
    \ model suggested therein assumes that the BS (sink) can\nget the information\
    \ of each node at any time, including node location, residual energy,\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n24 of 44\nand energy consumption rate. The suggested approach\
    \ relates to data routing and energy\nsupplement to undercharged nodes. The data\
    \ routing algorithm considers several factors:\nsensor buffer occupancy, load,\
    \ and energy. To ﬁnd the route for the mobile recharging\nunit to traverse, they\
    \ rely on Du [152] to seek the shortest Hamiltonian cycle between the\nnodes that\
    \ urgently need energy replenishment traversed by the mobile recharging unit.\n\
    Additional nodes along the traversed path can also be charged. Furthermore, the\
    \ mobile\nrecharging unit can also gather data from sensors with a critical buffer\
    \ occupancy during\nits recharging cycle.\nIn the following section, we discuss\
    \ network coding (NC) and, in particular, linear\nnetwork coding in the context\
    \ of data gathering in WSN.\n5.3. Network Coding (NC)\nNetwork coding leverages\
    \ the routing protocols and the ability to construct multi-path\nrouting between\
    \ sources and their destination (the sink) to enable intermediate nodes to\nperform\
    \ coding on the incoming packets before forwarding them. In the following section,\n\
    we discuss network-coding-related works.\nLinear network coding was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ by Celebiler and Stette [153] and evolved in\nthe seminal paper by Ahlswede\
    \ et al. [154] as a means to improve the network’s throughput,\nefﬁciency, and\
    \ scalability, which can also be leveraged to improve the network resilience\n\
    to attacks and eavesdropping. Linear network coding allows the network’s intermediate\n\
    nodes (e.g., relays) to accumulate arriving messages and forward a newly encoded\
    \ message,\nwhich is a linear combination of the accumulated packets, multiplying\
    \ them by coefﬁcients\nchosen from a ﬁnite ﬁeld. The manner in which nodes encode\
    \ and decode messages de-\npends on the selected coding scheme. Network coding\
    \ (NC) over wireless communication\ncan reduce the number of transmissions by\
    \ leveraging the fact that a single transmission is\noverheard by multiple nodes\
    \ in the transmitter’s vicinity, and can therefore be utilized by\neach of these\
    \ nodes, which will forward a coded packet with unique coefﬁcients comprising\n\
    its own message and the messages it overheard (e.g., [155]).\nIn WSNs, NC can\
    \ be utilized for various trafﬁc patterns, including data dissemination\n(one-to-many\
    \ communication) and data gathering. Works on energy-efﬁcient NC-based\ndissemination\
    \ can be followed in the survey [156], with multi-hop routing being empha-\nsized.\
    \ In data dissemination in which the base station/sink distributes information\
    \ to\nthe sensor nodes, NC is beneﬁcial mainly for distributing control messages\
    \ (broadcast or\nmulticast trafﬁc) or, in case of unicast trafﬁc, for recovering\
    \ lost packets (retransmissions).\nThe latter utilization relies on the fact that\
    \ different nodes heard or did not hear different\npackets. Accordingly, nodes\
    \ store packets they overheard, even if not destined to them-\nselves. The transmitter\
    \ (e.g., access-point) accumulates several packets that need to be\nretransmitted,\
    \ each for a different receiver. It transmits a coded packet that is a composite\n\
    of these accumulated packets. Each receiver can decode a missing packet by utilizing\
    \ its\nstored overheard packets (e.g., [157–162], where the last two mainly focus\
    \ on data dis-\nsemination of control management messages. It is noteworthy that\
    \ Cohen et al. [157] also\npresent a successful real HW radio deployment of their\
    \ scheme. XOR-CoW [163] exploits\nthe same concept to design an IoT protocol in\
    \ which relays transmit coded packets that\nmix downlink and uplink trafﬁc. Similar\
    \ to other previously mentioned studies, the coding\nscheme by Swamy et al. [163]\
    \ is over ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld of size 2 (GF(2)) (i.e., XORing the\ncoded packets).\n\
    Network coding is widely explored for data-gathering schemes. Typically, an NC-\n\
    based protocol involves both the coding scheme and the multi-path routing. It\
    \ relies on\nthe relay nodes to overhear packets and perform the coding, and on\
    \ the sink (or multiple\nsinks) to collect sufﬁcient coded packets (combinations)\
    \ to encode the sent information.\nThe limited ability of the sensors constrains\
    \ NC over WSN (e.g., limited storage to store\noverheard packets, limited computation\
    \ power to perform sophisticated operations, limited\nawake time for packet overhearing,\
    \ etc.). The utilized coding scheme inﬂuences the\nperformance of the NC algorithm\
    \ in several aspects such as the throughput, algorithm\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    25 of 44\ncomplexity, encoding complexity, decoding complexity, packet overhead\
    \ (bits), required\nfeedback, and so on. Note that many of these metrics are directly\
    \ translated to air time\nand energy consumption, which must be considered in\
    \ WSN. The random linear network\ncoding (RLNC) encoding scheme (e.g., [164])\
    \ is widely used because, despite its simplicity,\nit can attain throughput that\
    \ is close to the optimal one using a decentralized algorithm.\nIn RLNC, relays\
    \ transmit random linear combinations of the packets they receive, with\nrandomly\
    \ chosen coefﬁcients from a ﬁnite Galois ﬁeld (GF). The receiver must obtain a\n\
    sufﬁcient number of linearly independent combinations (packets) to decode the\
    \ original\npackets. If the GF size is sufﬁciently large, the probability that\
    \ the randomly generated\ncombinations will be linearly independent is high. However,\
    \ the receiver needs to know the\ncoefﬁcient used in each combination; hence,\
    \ it needs to be sent as overhead piggybacked on\neach traversed packet. The larger\
    \ the GF size, the higher the overhead. RLNC scheme with\ndistributed encoding\
    \ was utilized by Stefanovi´c et al. [165] for a perimeter data-gathering\nobjective,\
    \ in which the data should reach the perimeter nodes that are located on the\n\
    boundary of the covered area. The proposed scheme does not deploy routing algorithms\
    \ or\nmaintain routing information and relies on random walks.\nOne disadvantage\
    \ of RLNC is its decoding complexity in the order of O(n3), where n\ndenotes the\
    \ number of original packets. Sparse end-to-end erasure-correcting codes can\n\
    reduce the decoding load on the receiver at the cost of introducing an additional,\
    \ non-\nnegligible delay. Feizi et al. [166] suggest a tunable sparse network\
    \ coding (TSNC) scheme\nthat tunes the level of sparsity as the transmission process\
    \ evolves. This tuning process\ncan reduce the delay overhead by using denser\
    \ codes towards the end of the transmission\nwhile maintaining the complexity\
    \ advantages of a sparse code. Prior et al. [167] propose\ntwo network coding\
    \ schemes for information gathering, which are based on tunable sparse\ncodes,\
    \ with and without explicit feedback from the sink. The suggested schemes are\n\
    designed for meter readings in a smart grid. Nistor et al. [168] further exploit\
    \ RLNC and\nTSNC for data gathering and derived analytical bounds for a multi-hop\
    \ line network using\na ﬂuid model, which is valid for any ﬁeld size and various\
    \ sparsity levels, and has two\ndifferent feedback mechanisms.\nSenseCode [169]\
    \ adopts the NC paradigm, aspiring to balance energy efﬁciency and\nend-to-end\
    \ packet error rate. SenseCode relies on nodes transmitting both uncoded and\n\
    coded packets. Each node stores only a small portion of the packets it overhears,\
    \ which can\nbe attained by letting the node wake up sporadically within its duty\
    \ cycle and stay awake\nfor a short time interval each time it wakes up, storing\
    \ overheard packets. Accordingly,\neach coded packet comprises only a small subset\
    \ of the packets the node could have\npotentially overheard and coded. NetCoDer\
    \ [170] concentrates on a star topology in\nwhich the star-head can be a sink\
    \ or a relay that collects information from its neighbors.\nNetCoDer opportunistically\
    \ selects, based on network conditions, a set of relays that, in\naddition to\
    \ the data sent by the nodes, send additional coded packets with packets they\n\
    overheard, which helps the star-head recover lost packets. To reduce the overhead,\
    \ the\nrelays use LNC coefﬁcients based on the addresses of the sensor nodes.\
    \ A similar idea\nthat also does not rely on feedback was presented in SR-Code\
    \ [171] in which nodes and\nrelays send redundant coded messages to help the sink\
    \ recover lost messages. SR-Code\nutilizes the XOR operator (GF(2)). Similar to\
    \ NetCoDer, SR-Code reduces the overhead\nby using a bitmap to identify the coded\
    \ packets rather than the address of the sending\nnode. Al-Hawri et al. [172]\
    \ assume a data-gathering setup with single or multiple gateways\n(sinks) that\
    \ can collaborate (exchange information via accessible shared distributed storage\n\
    system). The paper distinguishes between traditional relays, which forward packets\
    \ they\nreceive as-is, and encoding relays, which perform network-coding on the\
    \ packets they\nreceive before forwarding them. The authors suggest a mathematical\
    \ model and a heuristic\nalgorithm to determine the number of network-encoding\
    \ nodes and their location, which\nis insufﬁcient for the aggregate received data\
    \ at the gateway/gateways to be decodable,\ntaking into account link failure scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n26 of 44\nProtocols that utilize NC in WSN need to balance\
    \ achieving the NC expedience and\ndiverse performance criteria. On the one hand,\
    \ the motivation is to send only coded packets,\nas sending uncoded packets degrades\
    \ the NC gain. On the other hand, a strategy in which\na relay waits for packets\
    \ to arrive in order to code them can yield unacceptable delays.\nFurthermore,\
    \ storing arriving packets while waiting for additional packets to arrive before\n\
    coding them can result in a buffer overﬂow and packet loss. To overcome these\
    \ drawbacks,\nChen et al. [173] suggest an opportunistic network coding (ONC)\
    \ approach in which the\nrelay can transmit either coded or uncoded packets. Each\
    \ relay determines whether to\ntransmit a coded or uncoded packet according to\
    \ its queue state at each transmission\nopportunity. For the simple topology of\
    \ a relay interconnecting two nodes that communi-\ncate with one another, Ref.\
    \ [173] presents an ONC strategy that can achieve the optimal\ndelay/power tradeoff.\
    \ Mirani et al. [174] adopt the ONC paradigm for data dissemination\nin vehicular\
    \ ad hoc networks (VANETs), for which the mobile nodes (vehicles) employ a\ndecode-and-forward\
    \ scheme with subjective timers determined according to their distance\nfrom the\
    \ source. In Tan et al. [175], an opportunistic routing protocol with opportunistic\n\
    network coding is proposed for correlated data gathering.\nNext, we provide more\
    \ recent works that utilize NC in WSNs and related networks\nthat are not particular\
    \ to data-gathering applications. Marques et al. [176] propose to use\nNC in a\
    \ fog computing scenario, since in the fog computing system architecture, the\
    \ data\nmeasured on a node should be delivered to many other destination nodes.\
    \ The authors\ndesign a protocol for encoding and decoding and provide a design\
    \ to incorporate it on\nthe MAC level. Uwitonze et al. [177] consider a setup\
    \ in which a WSN has been split into\nmultiple disjoint partitions and suggests\
    \ a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm based on\nspace network coding termed\
    \ relay placement using space network coding (i.e., rather than\nsend additional\
    \ coded data, additional relay nodes are deployed) for ﬁnding the optimal\nnumber\
    \ and positions to place relay nodes for restoring the network connectivity.\n\
    A network coding backpressure routing scheme for data aggregation in large-scale\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) networks is explored by Malathy et al. [178]. The proposed\
    \ routing\nscheme exploits network coding for the data aggregation process, which\
    \ improves the\nthroughput of the network by eliminating redundant packets. The\
    \ paper relies on cluster-\nbased routing that selects the cluster-heads (CH)\
    \ based on the available energy and distance,\nwhich helps to minimize trafﬁc\
    \ congestion and provide efﬁcient data transmission.\n5.4. Data Collection Utilizing\
    \ Mobile Sink and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nA different paradigm for the\
    \ traditional setup of data gathering in WSN, which\nrelies on a single or multiple\
    \ static sink(s) towards which all trafﬁc needs to travel, is\nthe utilization\
    \ of one or multiple mobile sinks (MSs) that traverse the terrain and collect\n\
    the reports from the devices. Such mobile sink(s) can be the trafﬁc’s ﬁnal destination\
    \ or\njust an accessory that collects the data and transmits it to the sink. Note\
    \ that in the latter\ncase, the ﬁnal destination is not necessarily located within\
    \ the wireless network realm\nand can be located outside it (e.g., within the\
    \ Internet or the cloud). Since these mobile\nsinks are unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ in many cases, these systems are sometimes called\nunmanned aerial vehicle-wireless\
    \ sensor networks (UAV–WSNs). This section reviews\nseveral state-of-the-art developments\
    \ in mobile sink(s). Since sometimes the MS routing\nchallenges are interleaved\
    \ with the MAC layer’s challenges, the solution suggested in some\npapers, and\
    \ accordingly their description, incorporated both layers.\nTypically, data-gathering\
    \ protocols that utilize moving sink(s) aim at optimizing some\nperformance metrics,\
    \ such as overall power consumption, average or worst latency of the\ndata, trajectory\
    \ traversed by the mobile sink, awake time of the sensors, maximizing the\nlife\
    \ cycle of the network, and so on. There are different options to classify these\
    \ protocols:\nthey can be classiﬁed according to this aforementioned performance\
    \ objective, or other\ncategories, such as characteristics of the moving sink,\
    \ its speed and constraints, network\nmodel, communication standard utilized,\
    \ and so on. In this section, we will classify the\nprotocol into two classes:\
    \ protocols that solely rely on the moving sink with no intra-trafﬁc\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2650\n27 of 44\nbetween the nodes (all the trafﬁc is directly transmitted\
    \ to the moving sink), and protocols\nthat combine routing between the nodes and\
    \ trafﬁc forwarding to the sink. This latter\nclass will mostly include cluster-based\
    \ protocols in which the nodes are clustered and\ncluster-heads (CHs) are selected,\
    \ but rather than the CHs routing the trafﬁc towards the\nsink, they forward the\
    \ trafﬁc directly to the mobile sink.\n5.4.1. Routing Directly to the Mobile Sink(s)\
    \ with No Intra-Node Data Forwarding\nIn this section, we review papers in which\
    \ the only data trafﬁc is between the nodes\nand the mobile sink, and no data\
    \ is forwarded between the nodes.\nZhan et al. [179] consider a general fading\
    \ channel model and suggest an efﬁcient\nsub-optimal solution that minimizes the\
    \ energy consumption of all sensor nodes (SNs)\nwhile ensuring that data is collected\
    \ reliably from all SNs with bounded outage probability.\nThe suggested solution\
    \ decouples the joint optimization problem, which considers both\nthe SNs’ wake-up\
    \ schedule and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV’s) trajectory, into two\nseparate\
    \ optimization problems, ensuring that the amount of data collected from each\
    \ SN\nreliably exceeds a threshold. One of the formulated optimization problems\
    \ is non-convex\ndue to non-convex constraints, and therefore it needs to be relaxed.\
    \ The two problems are\nsolved iteratively to obtain an approximate solution.\
    \ A ﬂight time minimization problem\nfor a UAV that collects data from a set of\
    \ energy-constrained ground sensors is studied by\nGong et al. [180]. The sensors\
    \ are assumed to be located on a line (one dimension). Each\nsensor has a certain\
    \ amount of data to upload. The UAV can collect data either while\nﬂying or while\
    \ hovering, and only from a single sensor at a time. Accordingly, the UAV’s\n\
    trajectory is divided into non-overlapping data collection intervals, each dedicated\
    \ to\ncollecting data from a single sensor. The objective is to minimize the total\
    \ ﬂight time of the\nUAV from an initial point to a destination by jointly optimizing\
    \ the division of intervals, the\nUAV’s speed, as well as the sensors’ transmission\
    \ power. The ﬂight time minimization is\nformulated as a dynamic programming (DP)\
    \ problem, where each DP stage considers ﬂight\ntime minimization for a single-sensor\
    \ data collection scenario. The algorithm for the single-\nsensor case is used\
    \ to ﬁnd the UAV’s optimal speed and the sensor’s transmission power.\nIt is shown\
    \ that the UAV’s optimal speed is proportional to the given energy of the sensors\n\
    and the inter-sensor distance but is inversely proportional to the data upload\
    \ requirements.\nThe metric addressed by Liu et al. [181] is the age of the information.\
    \ In particular,\nRef. [181] utilizes UAV, and suggests two age-optimal trajectories\
    \ for it to collect the\ndata from the ground SNs, one that minimizes the age\
    \ of the ‘oldest’ sensed information\namong the sensors, and another that minimizes\
    \ the average age of the information sensed\nby all sensors. It is shown that\
    \ both age-optimal trajectories correspond to the shortest\nHamiltonian path in\
    \ the wireless sensor network, in which the distance between any\ntwo sensors\
    \ is represented by the amount of inter-visit time. The authors adopt dynamic\n\
    programming and genetic algorithm to ﬁnd the two different age-optimal trajectories.\n\
    Liu et al. [182] also utilize a UAV to collect the data from the ground sensors.\
    \ The model\nsuggested therein assumes that the sensors (nodes) are randomly distributed\
    \ over a square\narea. The area is partitioned into small square cells. The UAV\
    \ ﬂying above the cells\nhovers above each cell to collect all the data of the\
    \ sensors within the cell. The paper\nstudies the amount of data per unit time\
    \ that the UAV can collect from the ground nodes\nas a function of the number\
    \ of cells, the height of the UAV, the number of sensors, and\nthe energy capacity\
    \ of the UAV. The paper suggests a similar analysis when multiple\nUAVs are utilized.\
    \ It seeks the optimal number of cells to maximize the per-node capacity\nunder\
    \ the suggested model and shows that under the suggested data collection network,\n\
    multiple UAVs can signiﬁcantly improve the per-node capacity attained by a single\
    \ UAV.\nThe balanced network communication protocol (BNCP) that utilizes UAV as\
    \ a mobile\nsink is suggested by Qin et al. [183]. There is no inter-sensor routing\
    \ in BNCP, and all\nsensors’ communication energy is spent on the sensor-UAV transmission\
    \ links. BNCP is\nimplemented and evaluated.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n28 of 44\n\
    5.4.2. Cluster-Based Data Forwarding\nRather than the mobile sink node traversing\
    \ the network between all the sensors, a\ndifferent approach groups the sensors\
    \ into clusters and selects cluster-heads (CH), which\ncollect the data from all\
    \ cluster members, thus decreasing the traverse of the mobile sink.\nIn general,\
    \ data gathering in a clustered WSN imposes a tradeoff between the energy\nconsumed\
    \ during data collection within each cluster and the energy consumed by the\n\
    mobile sink. On the one hand, the higher the number of clusters (smaller clusters),\
    \ the\nless energy is consumed during data collection by the cluster-heads (CH);\
    \ on the other\nhand, it follows that the UAV will have to access more CHs on\
    \ its route, and consequently,\nthe energy spent by the UAV will be higher in\
    \ that case. This trade-off is one of the main\nchallenges in addressing the joint\
    \ problem of clusterization and CH selection, jointly with\nﬁnding the path traversed\
    \ by the UAV, as reﬂected in several papers discussed below.\nNajjar-Ghabel et\
    \ al. [184] propose a two-phase algorithm, termed DGOB, for data\ngathering in\
    \ WSNs in an environment impaired by obstacles, which utilizes a mobile sink\n\
    that traverses the network and collects the data. Both phases, node clusterization\
    \ and\nMS trajectory construction, exploit artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) schemes.\
    \ Tazibt et al. [185]\nutilize a small-scale drone to gather the data from scattered\
    \ sensors. Like in several other\npapers that rely on UAV to collect data from\
    \ cluster-heads, the challenge in [185] is two-fold:\n(i) clusterization and CH\
    \ selection (in contrast with other papers, this paper allows multi-\nhop clusters,\
    \ such that cluster members are up to a predeﬁned number of hops from their\n\
    CH); and (ii) plan of the drone trajectory for traversing through all CHs with\
    \ minimum\nenergy consumption (e.g., minimum path length). Even though the two\
    \ problems are\nrelated, the authors solve the two issues sequentially. They ﬁrst\
    \ solve the CH selection\nby formulating an optimization problem that seeks the\
    \ minimal set of cluster-heads that\nguarantee that all nodes are at most h hops\
    \ from a CH in the set. After determining the CH\nset via linear programing, they\
    \ utilize the 2-opt heuristic, which relies on a simple local\nsearch algorithm\
    \ for solving the traveling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the optimal\ntravel\
    \ trajectory for the drone between the selected CHs.\nKumar and Dash [186] also\
    \ suggest a data-gathering-by-mobile-sink scheme in WSN.\nThe model in [186] assumes\
    \ that the mobile sink is moving along a pre-speciﬁed path with\nconstant speed\
    \ and can collect data while traveling. The paper denotes all the sensors\nthat\
    \ are in transmission range from the mobile-sink traversed path, and can therefore\n\
    relay trafﬁc to it, as sub-sinks. All other nodes need to forward their data to\
    \ these sub-\nsinks, possibly through multi-hop communication, in order for them\
    \ to relay the data\nto the mobile sink. The paper suggests two different models:\
    \ the ﬁrst assumes that the\nmobile sink can receive data from only one sensor\
    \ at a time, while the second assumes that\nthe mobile sink can receive data from\
    \ multiple sensors simultaneously. Both suggested\nalgorithms comprise three phases:\
    \ (i) identify the relay nodes (sub-sinks) that are within\ntransmission range\
    \ from the mobile sink trajectory (unit disk graph model), and partition\nthe\
    \ path into segments that are the union of all the transmission disks of all the\
    \ sub-sinks;\n(ii) determine the communication time each sub-sink can have with\
    \ the mobile sink, and\naccordingly, the amount of data it can transmit; (iii)\
    \ utilize a network ﬂow approach to\ndetermine which sub-sink transmits to the\
    \ mobile sink in each of the mobile sink’s path\nsegments. Ebrahimi et al. [187]\
    \ aim to optimize total transmission power between WSN\ncluster-heads in an IoT\
    \ network. The problem is split into subproblems, which include\nCH assignment,\
    \ building of the forwarding tree within each cluster, and optimal UAV\ntrajectory\
    \ calculation. The data transmitted by CH to UAV is pre-processed by a specialized\n\
    optimized compression. A genetic algorithm for energy-efﬁcient CH selection is\
    \ employed\nby Wu et al. [188].\nThe focus of Zahra et al. [189] is on MS that\
    \ traverses a WSN that relies on a cluster-\nbased data collection protocol in\
    \ which cluster-heads are responsible for collecting and\ntransmitting the cluster\
    \ members’ sensed data to the MS. The paper examines a scenario in\nwhich the\
    \ MS is constantly moving in a predeﬁned trajectory, regardless of whether the\n\
    data transfer was completed or not. Accordingly, when the cluster aggregate data\
    \ is too\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n29 of 44\nlarge, the CH cannot complete the\
    \ transaction. The authors suggest a mechanism in which,\nin case the CH cannot\
    \ complete the transaction, it can use different cluster members as\nrelays to\
    \ continue the transaction after the MS has moved out of the transmission range\n\
    of the CH. Likewise, Zhang et al. [190] also suggest a hybrid approach that combines\
    \ the\nMS with hierarchical routing-based protocol relying on node clusterization.\
    \ In order to\nimprove the efﬁciency of the MS data collection, Ref. [190] suggests\
    \ utilizing virtual heads\n(VHs) that lie on the MS trajectory on the cluster\
    \ boundaries that also transmit collected\ndata to the MS. The channel access\
    \ relies on a random access mechanism.\nThe UAV can be of different physical structures.\
    \ While some machines are able to slow\ndown and even to hover, others, especially\
    \ the winged UAVs, can only ﬂy with a constant\nvelocity. This limitation poses\
    \ an additional challenge; see Say et al. [191] for a possible\nsolution. To address\
    \ the velocity limitation, the grid topology of the UAV’s coverage is\ndivided\
    \ into frames, and the most distant frames get the highest priority. The priority-based\n\
    transmissions from sensors to the moving UAV are incorporated into a MAC layer,\
    \ by\nintroducing a priority-based contention window adjustment scheme. A smaller\
    \ contention\nwindow is assigned to the frame where sensors send packets from\
    \ the rear side of the UAV,\nand should therefore have a higher transmission priority.\
    \ This results in a low packet loss\nwhen the UAV ﬂies forward. On top of this\
    \ architecture, a frame-selection-based routing\nprotocol is formulated.\n6. Wearables\
    \ and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN)\nNumerous applications rely on data gathering\
    \ and report collection in WSN and IoT,\nand some are mentioned throughout the\
    \ paper. There is no doubt that the essence of WSN\nis the applications that utilize\
    \ the infrastructure discussed throughout this paper. Providing\na thorough review\
    \ of such applications can encompass several surveys. Since wearables\nare becoming\
    \ highly popular and a ubiquitous application which imposes new challenges\nin\
    \ the context of data gathering, we discuss several recent results and related\
    \ challenges in\nthe context of wearables. Figure 5 depicts the main topics discussed\
    \ in this section.\nWearables and WBAN\nSection 6\nEnergy Harvesting (EH)\nSection\
    \ 6.1\nTechnological Advances\nSection 6.2\nTransmission Protocols\nSection 6.3\n\
    WBAN Applications\nSection 6.4\nFigure 5. The main topics in the context of wearables\
    \ covered in the section, and a rough partition of\nthe papers covered by these\
    \ topics.\nWearable technology refers to smart devices attached to the human body\
    \ or apparel\nto monitor the user and their environment. Wearables are designed\
    \ to detect, analyze,\nand transmit information, which allows continuous monitoring\
    \ of the subject. In some\ncases (e.g., healthcare applications), feedback is\
    \ returned to the wearer with strict perfor-\nmance constraints (e.g., reliability,\
    \ latency bounds). Such applications can necessitate the\nmonitoring of both bodily\
    \ conditions, such as blood pressure, blood glucose level (e.g.,\nin conjunction\
    \ with an insulin pump), ECG, EMG, body temperature, accelerometer, and\ngyroscope,\
    \ as well as environmental conditions that might inﬂuence the user, such as\n\
    temperature, humidity, CO2 level, dust level, and location.\nSensing essential\
    \ human physiological parameters led to the innovation of wireless\nbody area\
    \ networks (WBANs). WBAN typically relates to a small area network that spans\n\
    the whole human body. It comprises devices (wearables) located in the apparel,\
    \ on the\nbody, or under the skin, and are wirelessly connected. Even though tracking\
    \ physical\nconditions applies to diverse domains, including medical, social,\
    \ and economic ones, each\nwith its particular implications and extensive research\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the speciﬁc challenges\nof acquiring data in WBANs necessitated\
    \ new solutions designed for WBAN. Speciﬁcally,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n30 of\
    \ 44\nsince the sensors in WBANS are designed to be located close to the monitored\
    \ individual,\nthey impose particular challenges related to their speciﬁc structural,\
    \ functional, and size-\nrelated constraints. In the sequel, we dwell on some\
    \ of the most critical challenges and\nrecent promising results on WBANS. The\
    \ main objective of this survey is to understand the\ndata-gathering challenges.\
    \ In the special case of WBANS, we also elaborate on the sensors’\nphysical and\
    \ mechanical structure, which directly impact the data acquisition process.\n\
    Many of the challenges pertaining to WSN in general, which are described throughout\n\
    this survey, also apply to wearables. However, some of these challenges are exaggerated\n\
    when applied to wearables due to their unique characteristics. For example, energy-related\n\
    challenges that are essential to address and substantially inﬂuence any WSN design\
    \ and\nperformance, open a different perspective on wearables. Speciﬁcally, due\
    \ to their sensing\ndevices’ tiny size, the energy storing capacities are limited.\
    \ Yet, many wearable applications,\nparticularly healthcare ones, employ continuous\
    \ sampling and communication tasks that\nconstantly consume energy and deplete\
    \ the device’s battery. Frequent battery replacement,\nwhich can be a burden in\
    \ any WSN, can be even more cumbersome in wearables and can\nhinder the adoption\
    \ of these technologies (e.g., when the wearables are implants, battery\nreplacement\
    \ can involve an invasive medical intervention). Accordingly, energy-efﬁcient\n\
    approaches designed for wearable sensor networks are important for disseminating\
    \ the\ntechnology into additional domains. An inclusive review of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ approaches\ndesigned for human context recognition (HCR) based on wearable sensor\
    \ networks is\ngiven by [192]. This paper classiﬁes energy-efﬁcient mechanisms\
    \ for health-related HCR\napplications, based on the task that the mechanism is\
    \ aimed at to reduce its energy con-\nsumption (e.g., sensing, communication,\
    \ computation). The paper reviews the related\nworks according to the classiﬁcation.\n\
    6.1. Energy Harvesting (EH)\nEnergy harvesting as a battery alternative has been\
    \ discussed in Section 5.2. However,\nEH in the context of wearables encounters\
    \ new challenges, such as critical reliability level,\nexpected tiny size and\
    \ position in/on the human body, limited exposure to energy sources\nsuch as solar\
    \ energy, and so on. Accordingly, we revisit EH and review some EH studies\nin\
    \ the context of wearables. The three most prominent techniques include photovoltaic\n\
    cells attached to a wearable (energy is accumulated from environmental illumination),\n\
    thermoelectric nanogenerators (the energy source is the heat produced by the human\
    \ body),\nand kinetic energy harvesters (energy is created by natural body motion).\
    \ All energy\nharvesting cases pose a fundamental challenge of effective energy\
    \ management, which\ninvolves continuous decision making regarding how much energy\
    \ to spend on sensing,\nmeasurements, on-board classiﬁcation, and transmission\
    \ (see also Section 5.2).\nWe present examples for each of the techniques mentioned\
    \ above in the context\nof wearables. Thermoelectric energy-harvesting units exploiting\
    \ self-generated human\nheat are suggested to be fabricated straight into the\
    \ textile of the garments [193]. Energy\nharvesting for activity-aware wearables\
    \ is designed by Khalifa et al. [194]. The idea is to\nremove the accelerometers,\
    \ which consume about 80% of the battery. Instead, the authors\npropose to employ\
    \ kinetic energy harvesters, which will convert human motion into\nelectrical\
    \ power. Additionally, to compensate for the accelerometers’ removal, the input\
    \ and\noutput of the kinetic energy harvester would be analyzed by a specialized\
    \ activity classiﬁer\nto track and identify the human activity (i.e., to perform\
    \ the primary task of the wearable).\nLight-based energy-harvesting wearables\
    \ are discussed by Park et al. [195]. It is noteworthy\nthat as the available\
    \ luminosity can be highly unpredictable, the overall functioning, data-\ngathering,\
    \ and transmission process would imply an optimization problem. Henceforth,\n\
    the same authors suggest a protocol to optimize the number and accuracy of interpretation\n\
    of human gestures by an energy-harvesting wearable device under an energy budget,\n\
    Park et al. [196]. To this end, they constructed an analytical model that characterizes\n\
    energy consumption based on experimental data and formulized the optimization\
    \ problem.\nEsteves et al. [197] suggest incorporating energy harvesting as part\
    \ of MAC 802.15.6. The\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n31 of 44\nproposed MAC modiﬁcation\
    \ includes the usage of some body sensors as relays. The\nmanaging part at a hub\
    \ (e.g., a smartphone) sets the optimal relay charging times to\nperform the data\
    \ transmission by relay effectively. A source and the relays send their\nenergy-harvesting\
    \ updates within the request for cooperation (RFC) packets. The charging\ntimes\
    \ are calculated according to the amount of energy at the source and relays and\
    \ are\nupdated in accordance with previous packet transmission success or failure.\n\
    6.2. Technological Advances\nWBAN utilization is penetrating new domains, spanning\
    \ a wide variety of sensors,\neach providing a different aspect of the monitored\
    \ subject. For example, healthcare ap-\nplications are expected to provide a wide\
    \ span of indicators from various physiological\nparameters. Speciﬁcally, to provide\
    \ a comprehensive status of the examinee, it requires, in\naddition to the standard\
    \ indicators such as heart rate and physical activity that many of us\nalready\
    \ have integrated in our watch, information at a deeper level and molecular level\n\
    insight into the dynamics of the wearer.\nTo cope with the growing popularity\
    \ of wearables and their expansion to a broader\nscope of applications, especially\
    \ in healthcare systems, with the increasing demand to\nimprove quality of service\
    \ (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE), a new generation of\nwearables has emerged.\
    \ This generation relies on several technological advances in both\nthe device\
    \ and cloud realms. The novel device technology utilizes new soft-sensing tech-\n\
    nologies, including innovative wearable materials such as conducting polymers,\
    \ rigid\nforms of hydrogel, gold and silver nanowires (to create nanowired tattoos\
    \ as stretchable\nsensors), carbon nanotubes, liquid metals, ionic liquids, and\
    \ others. These materials give\nrise to novel sensor families, such as electro-physiological\
    \ (acting on the electric potential\ndifference) physical and chemical sensors.\
    \ See the latest advances in the following related\nworks [198–200]. For example,\
    \ besides reviewing the key developments in sweat-sensing\ntechnology, Bariya\
    \ et al. [198] examine the requirements of the underlying components\nembedded\
    \ in sweat-based wearable sensors and discuss challenges for integrating wearable\n\
    sweat sensors in the development of personalized healthcare. Sweat-sensing technology\n\
    has been described earlier; see, for example, Salvo et al. [201], where a device\
    \ containing\ntwo humidity sensors located at different heights from the skin\
    \ is designed in a way that\nallows one to measure the sweat rate by the difference\
    \ in readings of these two sensing\nsub-units. Thermal comfort control by calculating\
    \ the relation between the vapor pres-\nsure and the temperature is designed into\
    \ watch-type sweat sensors by Sim et al. [202].\nSweat measurement by sweat biomarkers\
    \ (in particular, pH and Na+) is implemented\nby Song et al. [203]. In short,\
    \ the biomarkers cause a change in electric potential near the\nmeasuring device,\
    \ allowing for accurate sweat measurement during physical activity. The\nauthors\
    \ also note that the change in electrical potential allows for energy harvesting,\
    \ which\ncan be effectively managed to self-power the device and thus allow for\
    \ a battery-free design.\nIn general, the material imprinted into the working\
    \ reacting electrode determines which\nsubstance (i.e., a chemical component present\
    \ in the sweat) it will react with. For example,\nan application of electrochemical\
    \ differential pulse voltammetry to sense the sweat to\nmeasure the level of caffeine\
    \ is devised by Tai et al. [204].\nThe main challenge in the devices is to implement\
    \ capabilities of effective data gath-\nering, ﬁltering, and transmission within\
    \ microscopic computing units. Some biometric\nsensing (especially made by speciﬁc\
    \ conﬁgurations of adjacent sensor sets) produces large\namounts of data (as in\
    \ ECG sensing) that should undergo an appropriate local density\nreduction. To\
    \ ensure conformity with the sensing devices, paper lithium batteries are\nproposed\
    \ (see, e.g., [205]). In addition, many sensors are conﬁgured only to transmit\n\
    following special hazards. For example, ECG sensors should trigger an alarm in\
    \ case the\nheartbeat is abnormal. This local data processing is a preliminary\
    \ phase that facilitates\nthe more intensive data analyses in the intermediate\
    \ data collection unit (the smartphone),\nand ﬁnally, the destination server.\
    \ To treat noisiness and variability (if the sensor sampling\nfrequency is too\
    \ high) of raw data from an accelerometer or gyroscope or loss of data (if the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2650\n32 of 44\nsensor sampling frequency is too low), variable\
    \ sampling is proposed by Li et al. [206]. The\nofﬂine ML classiﬁcation algorithm\
    \ is used to identify and predict the physical activity.\nThe recent development\
    \ of miniature sensors combined with minimization of battery\nsize and energy\
    \ harvesting advances is sometimes referred to as a new paradigm, known as\nWearables\
    \ 2. For example, Ling et al. [207] provide a detailed description of various\
    \ types\nof sensors, means of attaching them to the human body, multiple parameters\
    \ the sensors\nare capable of measuring, and techniques to communicate and process\
    \ the measured data.\n6.3. Transmission Protocols\nWe note that while many of\
    \ the works mentioned above employ a smartphone device\nwith an application that\
    \ is presumably tailored to receive data from the wearables, having\na dedicated\
    \ hardware device that would ofﬂoad some of the networking burden (e.g.,\npotential\
    \ simpliﬁcation of the packetizing process) of the sensors would be more effective\n\
    and reliable. Indeed, in Pathak et al. [208], a central processing hub allows\
    \ one to circumvent\nthe cumbersome processes of sensor identiﬁcation, sensor\
    \ joining, and reconﬁguration\nby providing a designated interface. The authors\
    \ provide real hardware implementation,\nexplore various performance metrics,\
    \ and provide energy measurements.\nSeveral available protocols for data transmission\
    \ are suitable for WBAN. We mention\nhere the low Bluetooth energy (BLE; see,\
    \ e.g., Townsend et al. [209] for a detailed protocol\nstack description and Gomez\
    \ et al. [210] for performance evaluation and comparison with\nordinary Bluetooth\
    \ and other protocols). For distances of several centimeters, near-ﬁeld\ncommunication\
    \ (NFC) protocol (see Coskun et al. [211] for the theory and Kim et al. [212]\n\
    for a description of possible device designs and applications). Details of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.6\nstandard, which covers WBAN, can be found in, for example, Kwak\
    \ et al. [213]. One sees\ntherein how the human body communications PHY layer\
    \ in particular is deﬁned.\n6.4. WBAN Applications\nEven though, as stated earlier,\
    \ there is no intention to provide a thorough review of\nWBAN applications, we\
    \ mention several interesting ones. Monitoring of workers involved\nin extreme\
    \ conditions or whose activity can be potentially dangerous (e.g., Lee et al.\
    \ [214])\nsuggest wearable sensors for monitoring miners or construction professionals.\
    \ This study\nevaluates integrated wearable sensors for measuring construction\
    \ workers’ personal level\nof workload, individual factors, and physiological\
    \ reactions during rooﬁng activities. A\nfatigue detection system for car drivers\
    \ by Chang et al. [215] includes smart glasses, which\nare able to identify possible\
    \ drowsiness by an IR detector aimed at the driver’s eyes,\nequipped with BLE\
    \ transmitter. A small processor embedded into the glasses gathers and\npre-analyzes\
    \ the data and then transmits them to the on-board computer in the car. The\n\
    latter makes a decision about whether to issue a fatigue warning and sends it\
    \ to the cloud.\nWearables can be attached to a human body in order to sense the\
    \ environment for the safety\nof the carrier, as in Wu et al. [216]. The data\
    \ (humidity and temperature) is then transmitted\nto a mobile unit, where it can\
    \ be analyzed locally or further transmitted to the cloud in order\nto issue timely\
    \ warnings. Classiﬁcation of sports activity is implemented and validated by\n\
    experiments by Qi et al. [217], where the activity is identiﬁed from accelerometer\
    \ and ECG\nmeasurements done by chest and wrist sensors. The measurements are\
    \ transmitted to a\nsmartphone, which performs the data processing. SVM is employed\
    \ for the classiﬁcation.\nYou et al. [218] suggest a real-time wireless body sensor\
    \ networks (WBSNs) scheme\nfor welfare assessment and disease monitoring, prevention,\
    \ and treatment. The suggested\nscheme is composed of three components: sensing,\
    \ communication, and management.\nSensing attains a set of physiological parameters,\
    \ such as heart rate, body temperature,\nECG, temperature, blood pressure, blood\
    \ glucose, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, from\ndesignated sensors embedded\
    \ on a smart shirt worn by the monitored user. Communi-\ncation handles the processes\
    \ of delivering the sensed physiological data and controlling\ninstructions to\
    \ a backend server through wireless networks. The transmission protocols\ncan\
    \ be divided into two segments: the transfer of information from the sensors to\
    \ a central\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n33 of 44\nterminal located at a smartphone\
    \ and the transfer of information between the smartphone\nand the designated server,\
    \ which is located on the healthcare cloud. The communication\nrelies on multiple\
    \ communication protocols including Bluetooth, WiFi, and 3G/4G (which\ncan be\
    \ replaced by 5G where available). Management is responsible for collecting, classify-\n\
    ing, and monitoring the physiological data, and furthermore, being able to issue\
    \ warning\nmessages to medical professionals or caregivers whenever the physiological\
    \ data are ab-\nnormal. Additional applications utilizing data gathering can be\
    \ found in the following\nsurvey [219].\nWe conclude by emphasizing that the beneﬁts\
    \ of WBANs have not run their course\nyet. The development of data gathering will\
    \ jointly progress with the ongoing advances\nin sensor construction and manufacturing\
    \ capability, development, and standardization\nof Wearables 2 and beyond. Development\
    \ of specialized post-processing platforms poses\na specialized challenge, and\
    \ the urge to make progress in this area is acute. To illustrate\nthis, on account\
    \ of an ever-growing population, specialized platforms for elderly care\nare needed;\
    \ see, for example, the recent papers [220,221] about wearables designated for\n\
    elderly patients and references therein.\nFinally, wearables have been recently\
    \ harnessed for combating the COVID-19 disease.\nEarly identiﬁcation of COVID-19\
    \ symptoms by evaluating the resting heart rate during the\nasymptomatic (presumably\
    \ infectious) period and analysis by a deep learning framework\nis evaluated by\
    \ Bogu and Snyder [222]. While the precision of such a tool is clearly inferior\n\
    to the standard medical assays, it may be useful to provide a preliminary alert\
    \ for the\nearly onset of the disease for people in risk groups. Hassantabar et\
    \ al. [223] suggest a\nframework termed CovidDeep that combines commercially available\
    \ wearable physiolog-\nical feature sensors (WMSs) and a simple yes/no questionnaire\
    \ with efﬁcient DNNs for\npervasive large-scale monitoring of disease onset and\
    \ health condition. The automatically\nextracted raw data and medical background\
    \ and symptom responses are combined with\nsynthetically generated data to train\
    \ the DNN architecture. Grow-and-prune synthesis is\nused to generate accurate\
    \ and computationally efﬁcient models that can be deployed for\nCOVID-19 inference.\n\
    Since viruses can spread between people who are in close contact with an infected\n\
    person, and since infected people may be asymptomatic, the pandemic taught us\
    \ that it\nis best to keep a safe distance from others (see, for example, Cortellessa\
    \ et al. [224] for\nclose-proximity risk assessment for COVID infection). Accordingly,\
    \ most health institutions\nrecommend keeping physical distance between people\
    \ in public places (commonly termed\nas ”social distancing”) in order to stop\
    \ the pandemic from spreading. Furthermore, people\nwho were in the proximity\
    \ of an infected person (tested positive for COVID) are encouraged\nto be examined,\
    \ and several governmental regulations even require such people to stay in\nquarantine.\
    \ Several recent studies have suggested leveraging wearables for contact tracing\n\
    in order to identify the hazard from close proximity. For example, Ng et al. [225]\
    \ focus on\nBluetooth low energy and discuss the different data ﬂow approaches\
    \ and the accuracy of\nsmartphone vs. smartwatch applications in proximity detection.\
    \ Bian et al. [226] utilize\nwearables to monitor social distancing as recommended\
    \ for preventing COVID-19 spread.\nIn particular, the authors design compact potentially\
    \ wearable oscillating-magnetic-ﬁeld-\nbased proximity-sensing prototype systems\
    \ suitable for the relevant safety distance and able\nto track social distancing\
    \ much more reliably than the current Bluetooth-based smartphone\ntechnology.\
    \ Shubina et al. [227] provide a brief technical overview of the main contact-\n\
    tracing approaches and the challenges they impose on wearable technology. The\
    \ paper\nalso provides a short overview of the existing solutions deployed for\
    \ contact tracing and a\ndiscussion on the potential effect of wearables in tackling\
    \ the spread of a highly contagious\nvirus. More works from the past year discuss\
    \ the use of wearables for remote management\nand automated assessment of COVID-19.\
    \ Amft et al. [228] provide an overview of insti-\ntutional initiatives and alternative,\
    \ more accurate technologies for detection of infection\nsymptoms and possible\
    \ contact with infected individuals. Channa et al. [229] is a system-\nSensors\

    \ sensors and their clinical utilization\nin screening and contact tracing.\n\
    7. Concluding Remarks\nData gathering in modern WSN and IoT networks encompasses\
    \ many challenges,\nwhich span the entire communication stack. Many techniques,\
    \ protocols, and solutions\nhave been proposed over the years, but as technology\
    \ advances, new challenges and new\nopportunities arise. In this survey, we reviewed\
    \ these main challenges and opportunities, as\nwell as recent advances, and related\
    \ them to speciﬁc data-gathering research domains. We\nprovided a comprehensive\
    \ state-of-the-art data-gathering literature review in modern WSN\nnetworks, distinguishing\
    \ between the communication layers and the research domain.\nWe ﬁrst summarized\
    \ general architectural novelties and emerging architectures. We\nreviewed several\
    \ new technological advances and their inﬂuence on sensing device design,\nthe\
    \ platform carrying it, and the transceiver. We reviewed the effect of these architectural\n\
    advantages on speciﬁc applications, such as agriculture, smart cities, smart homes.\
    \ We\nshowed how cloud computing drives new WSN types, which introduces new directions,\n\
    and discussed how WSN can coexist within social network domains. Compressed sensing\n\
    was summarized next. We provided an overview of this important scheme and reviewed\n\
    its utilization in WSNs. We proceeded with the MAC layer. Since the performance\
    \ of many\ninnovations in the higher layers rely on the underlay MAC protocol\
    \ and since many data\ngathering schemes utilize traditional WSN MAC protocols,\
    \ we provided an overview of\nthese traditional protocols and mentioned state-of-the-art\
    \ works in WSN and IoT. These\nworks devise new MAC approaches for data gathering.\
    \ Next, we covered the recent\nadvances in routing. Similarly, we opened with\
    \ an overview of the traditional routing\nprotocols utilized for data-gathering\
    \ and reviewed several recent enhancements. We\nreviewed the utilization of network\
    \ coding for data gathering and explored the facilitation\nof UAV and mobile-sink\
    \ in collecting the data from the sensors. Lastly, we turned our\nattention to\
    \ the area of wearables which opens new research horizons for human health and\n\
    activity surveillance and discussed the new paradigm of Wireless Body Area Networks.\
    \ In\nthe spirit of the times, we concluded with several studies that utilize\
    \ some of the techniques\ndiscussed in this survey to aid in combating the COVID\
    \ pandemic.\nWhile we provided the general background to the research areas we\
    \ covered, we\nmainly focused on cutting-edge research works. Yet we note that\
    \ even seemingly exhausted\ntopics, such as MAC and Routing protocols, provide\
    \ new technological developments and\npresent opportunities for new research domains.\n\
    As implied throughout this survey, there are several research areas that attract\
    \ a\nlot of attention and anticipation for future developments. For example, technological\n\
    innovations in manufacturing more compact sensing units with yet superior transmission,\n\
    reception and processing capabilities are extremely in demand in several disciplines\
    \ which\ninclude wearables, smart homes, IoT-related domains and others. All the\
    \ more so, this\nis relevant when dealing with healthcare applications and implants.\
    \ Such technological\ninnovations will require in turn enhancements to other domains\
    \ across the communication\nstack in order to adjust to the new opportunities\
    \ and limitations. Energy acquisition is\nstill a fruitful research domain. In\
    \ this respect, ﬁnding new sources of energy harvesting\n(EH), better utilization\
    \ of existing energy resources and energy storage are still challenging\nresearch\
    \ ﬁelds. Similarly, new EH methods impose multiple new challenges on the entire\n\
    protocol stack, which are correlated with the EH method, e.g., different EH methods\
    \ dictate\nconstraints on the MAC design, which in turn, impact the routing protocol\
    \ which affects\nthe performance end eventually the application utilizing the\
    \ infrastructure. The growth of\nsuch networks supporting a variety of heterogeneous\
    \ devices of communication standards\nand their increasing density requires more\
    \ effective data compression techniques and\nefﬁcient on-grid data analyses (i.e.,\
    \ even prior to data delivery to sinks). On the off-grid\nside of WSNs, we note\
    \ that consistent progress in Cloud Computing (CC) technology and\nexploitation\
    \ methodology will open new horizons in data analysis.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2650\n\
    35 of 44\nDeployment of Edge Computing units cooperating with sensing-capable\
    \ units will\nimply the development of novel data-gathering schemes. As WSN density\
    \ increases,\nchallenges in the gathering of useful data by WSN and its consequent\
    \ analysis will coincide\nwith those of Big Data. Clearly, the processes of such\
    \ analyses should be implemented\nwithin Cloud Computing systems. The fashion\
    \ of the CC physical resources deployed in\norder to efﬁciently interact with\
    \ WSN is not necessarily similar to those of usual IT-to-CC\nconnectivity. It\
    \ is not currently properly standardized and, most importantly, it is not\nclear\
    \ how correctly CC (e.g., which HW, correct deployment of Access Points) should\
    \ be\ncross-planned with a particular WSN. Issues of security and privacy which\
    \ are not covered\nin this survey will continue to elicit a major interest, especially\
    \ in keeping with evolving\nhealth care applications. The growth of the network\
    \ and their variability will require a\ngreater measure of adoption of ML and\
    \ AI methods and the development of such new\nspecialized methods for WSN in the\
    \ very near future.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nConﬂicts\

  title: 'Data Gathering Techniques in WSN: A Cross-Layer View'
  verbatim_quote1: '"The Internet of things (IoT) aims to improve day-to-day life.
    The concept includes

    smart cities, smart homes, pervasive health care, assisted living, environmental
    monitoring,

    surveillance, and so on. The IoT paradigm relies on interconnecting a large number
    of

    device (things) linked by the Internet via heterogeneous access networks through
    which

    they can exchange information with one or more Internet gateways that can process
    the

    data, take action, and forward them to another destination if needed. Since many
    IoT

    devices are expected to be wireless, and since sensing is one of the main tasks
    and tools

    utilized by the IoT paradigm, IoT systems will rely extensively on WSN technology."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Data collection is commonly the core application in WSN and IoT
    networks, which

    are typically composed of a large variety of devices, some constrained by their
    resources

    (e.g., processing, storage, energy) and some by highly diverse demands. Many challenges

    span all the conceptual communication layers, from the physical to the application
    layer."'

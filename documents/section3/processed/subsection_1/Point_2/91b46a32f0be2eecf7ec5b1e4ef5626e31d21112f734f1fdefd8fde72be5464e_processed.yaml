    is rapidly gaining momentum, driven by the ever-evolving industry landscape. Numerous
    startups have embarked on blockchain projects, and investments in this technology
    have surged significantly. Despite blockchain’s ongoing development in terms of
    technological maturity, there is a continuous surge in innovative experimental
    adoption and customization [1]. Blockchain possesses the potential to disrupt
    established innovations and reshape industries or create entirely new ones [1].
    The initial trends in the emergence of cryptocurrencies have already demonstrated
    that blockchain technology is a disruptive force in the banking and financial
    services sectors [2]. Notably, cryptocurrencies have the potential to challenge
    centralized banking systems by eliminating the transaction fees typically associated
    with credit and debit card usage [3]. Recent developments suggest that blockchain
    is transitioning from a disruptive technology to a sustaining one [4]. Its significant
    potential extends well beyond the realm of finance and is poised to have a substantial
    impact on supply chain management, healthcare, the Internet of Things (IoT), education,
    and public services. The commercial feasibility and acceptance of blockchain are
    steadily increasing [3]. The patent landscape further underscores the growing
    influence of blockchain, with more than 3021 patent families associated with blockchain
    applications falling into four sub-categories: payments and transaction systems,
    financial services business, administration, and e-commerce [5]. Blockchain’s
    high level of security is attributed to its extensive use of cryptography and
    decentralization. Concerns about privacy, often associated with public blockchains,
    can be addressed by implementing blockchains in a controlled manner, known as
    permissioned blockchain, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. An overview of the blockchain
    architectures. Blockchain has the capacity to record various types of transactions,
    contracts, data assets, or virtually any information that can be stored digitally
    [6]. Blockchain records possess enduring qualities and are digitally structured,
    transparent, and easily accessible, as shown in Figure 1. Each newly generated
    “block” is appended to the end of an existing “chain,” and the initiation, validation,
    storage, and distribution of each block are governed by a predefined protocol
    [7]. This technology eliminates the necessity for third-party intermediaries,
    as participants within the blockchain network execute complex algorithms to verify
    the integrity of the records within the block. Blockchain presents an intriguing
    alternative to conventional data storage methods [8]. Historically, databases
    have been the primary means of data storage. While databases offer speed and user-friendliness,
    they also come with limitations and challenges, such as the absence of immutability
    [1,9]. Table 1 outlines the key distinctions between blockchain and traditional
    databases. Blockchain databases offer distinct advantages and trade-offs, making
    them suitable for different use cases based on specific requirements for data
    security, transparency, immutability, and decentralization [10]. A blockchain
    system comprises various integral components that collaborate to facilitate business
    transactions and operations [6]. Table 1. Comparison of databases with blockchain
    [1]. Node: A node refers to a computational unit within the blockchain network
    with the capability to initiate, receive, or validate transactions [11]. It operates
    using software applications designed for specific business use cases. Typically,
    blockchains feature two types of nodes. Validator Nodes: These nodes possess enhanced
    capabilities, allowing them to initiate, receive, and validate transactions. Member
    Nodes: Member nodes, on the other hand, are limited to initiating and receiving
    transactions. Transaction: In the context of a blockchain, a transaction is a
    collection of various data items that convey information about the exchange of
    assets, services, entities, events, or anything of value. Block: A block is a
    data structure tasked with storing a collection of transactions. After undergoing
    successful verification, each block is distributed to all the nodes across the
    blockchain network. Block Number: This identifier uniquely identifies blocks within
    the chain of blocks. User Nodes: User nodes are primarily responsible for initiating
    transactions and do not engage in block verification. These components collectively
    form the foundation of a blockchain system, enabling secure, transparent, and
    tamper-resistant transactions and data management. Several well-known consensus
    algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of Activity (POA),
    which combines elements of both POW and POS [12], and Proof of Capacity (POC).
    2. Blockchain-Based CRN Security Technique Blockchain is a basic innovation preoccupied
    via Bitcoin. It is another use of conventional innovation in the web period that
    incorporates conveyed information stockpiling innovation, remote organizations,
    agreement systems, and cryptography [7]. Table 2 A, B represents the block structure
    in a blockchain radio network. As a decentralization public data set, blockchain
    utilizes public keying cryptographical calculations, hashing capacities, agreement
    instruments, and different innovations to fabricate a decentralized non-verification
    framework that could be utilized in internet business to guarantee client data
    security [7,13]. It would additionally advance the course of monetary globalization
    and would enormously affect the current monetary marketing design and, surprisingly,
    social design [5]. Blockchain innovation enjoys the benefits of the lowest exchange
    costs, solid straightforwardness, and the highest securities. Normal issues like
    a significant expense, low effectiveness, and low information stockpiling security
    in the normalized data set give groundbreaking thoughts [13,14]. Blockchain is
    a carefully designed, full history information base stockpiling innovation that
    ordinarily utilizes highlight direct innovation to coordinate every hub. Every
    hub understands the elements of steering, and a new hub distinguishes proof and
    information dispersal via multicast. By utilizing cryptography, it can create
    related information blocks. The created information could look at the legitimacy
    of the data and likewise understand the solid connection via the following information
    [15]. Taking into account the benefits of blockchain innovation, this paper gives
    a psychological remote organization security calculation dependent on blockchains
    [11]. Table 2. (A, B) Block structure in a blockchain radio network summary [1].
    Algo Design Structure Clients speak via the block chain framework in the combination
    place. The particular construction is displayed in Figure 2. The IoT gadget sends
    its hub data to the combination place, and the combination community inquiries
    the blockchain framework for the presence of its hub data. Afterwards, the hub
    sends the information endorsed via the private keying to the combination place,
    and checks when the detecting hub had a relating private keying paired signature.
    Figure 2. Security calculation construction of the intellectual remote organization.
    Assuming is the above, the hub’s solicitation is forwarded to the blockchain framework,
    and the reaction of the blockchain framework is sent back to the detecting hub.
    Some potential research gaps identified in CRN security are in the field of physical
    layer security, machine learning-based attacks and defenses, security in spectrum
    sensing, coexistence with legacy systems, dynamic key management, privacy preservation,
    cross-layer security, resilience against jamming and spoofing, blockchain and
    distributed ledgers, secure localization, and security education and awareness
    [16]. 3. Blockchain Technology Blockchain-Based Secure Spectrum This paper presents
    blockchain innovation and a notoriety system into the range detecting measure.
    Another safe range detecting strategy was proposed. This security detecting strategy
    incorporated the assessment of the client’s immediate standing and suggestion
    notoriety. To stay away from conspiracy assault and malevolent hub conduct, the
    detecting results were more precise. The particular working course of the safety
    range detection dependent on blockchain innovation is displayed in Figure 3. The
    value was determined using Equation (1). 𝑇 𝑖 = 𝑁 𝑖 𝑘 𝜃 𝜔 𝑖 (1) Figure 3. Flow
    chart depicting the security enhancement in CRNs through the blockchain-based
    spectrum sensing algorithm. In Equation (1), Ti addresses the ith detecting period,
    Ni is the quantity of all the detecting periods up to the Ti time frame. The significance
    of k is equivalent to and shows the right number of intuitive detections in the
    history, θ implies the detecting activity force, its worth is determined by ωi,
    which is the impact coefficient of the detecting times in the public record book.
    Its worth is determined by Equations (2) and (3). 𝜃=1− 𝑒 |− 𝑘 𝑚𝑛 | (2) 𝜔 𝑖 = ∑
    𝑛 𝑖=1 | ℎ 1 𝑚 . 𝑙 𝑛 | (3) where h1 is the number of cooperations in l period,
    m is the size of the detecting period in every period, and n is the all-out association
    time frame. It can be seen from the equation that the nearer the cooperation history
    in the public record book, the more prominent the extent, and the effect on the
    trust worth will increment as needed. At the point when the trust worth of the
    hub is not in the front line, with everything being equal, the hub is chosen by
    figuring the extensive trust esteem, and the thorough trust worth of the hub is
    determined by Equation (4). 𝑇 𝑖,𝑐 =∅ 𝑇 𝑖 +𝜑| 𝑇 𝑖 +𝜃 ∑ 𝑖 𝑤 𝑖 | (4) The blockchain
    can contribute to improving CRN security for immutable transaction records, secure
    spectrum allocation, consensus mechanisms, decentralization, secure identity and
    authentication, transparency and trust, and resilience to sybil attacks and data
    integrity. By integrating blockchain technology into CRNs, network operators can
    enhance security, transparency, and trust in spectrum allocation and access. It
    provides a robust foundation for managing spectrum resources and mitigating various
    security threats commonly associated with dynamic and shared spectrum environments
    [17]. The NES algorithm plays a crucial role within the context of dynamic spectrum
    sensing in CRNs. Its primary purpose is to effectively and intelligently evaluate
    and select the nodes that will participate in the spectrum sensing process, ultimately
    improving the overall efficiency and reliability of spectrum utilization [18].
    The NES algorithm aims to address the challenges of dynamic spectrum sensing in
    CRNs, where multiple nodes must collaboratively sense and share information about
    the available spectrum bands. Its core purposes are node evaluation, node selection,
    efficiency enhancement, and reliability improvement. In dynamic spectrum sensing
    scenarios [19], where the availability of spectrum bands can change rapidly, the
    NES algorithm is highly relevant and valuable. The NES algorithm serves as an
    intelligent mechanism for selecting nodes in CRNs, ensuring that spectrum sensing
    is efficient, reliable, and adaptable to the dynamic nature of the spectrum availability.
    It plays a vital role in optimizing resource usage and improving the overall performance
    and trustworthiness of dynamic spectrum sensing in CRNs [20]. Various sectors,
    including satellite services, government agencies, and industries like broadcasting
    and aerospace, also rely on the spectrum [21]. Balancing the needs of these sectors
    with the demand for wireless data can lead to challenges in spectrum allocation.
    The scarcity of available spectrums can limit the ability to conduct experiments,
    trials, and research on new wireless technologies and applications. These trends
    and statistics highlight the pressing need for continued research in spectrum
    management, allocation, and optimization. As technology advances and new applications
    emerge, the urgency to find innovative solutions to address spectrum scarcity
    becomes even more critical. 4. Result Analysis In this section, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the outcomes derived from the integration of blockchain technology
    within the context of the cognitive radio network. To provide a comprehensive
    understanding of our findings, we reference and elaborate upon the simulation
    parameters, as outlined in Table 3. The simulation area for the network was defined
    as a circular region with a radius of ‘m’. Within this area, primary users were
    positioned at arbitrary locations along the circumference of the circle. In the
    given system, the signal power was 100 MW (megawatts), and the bandwidth was 100
    kHz (kilohertz). There were 15 nodes in the system, with SNRs (signal-to-noise
    ratios) of −18 dB and −14 dB for some of the nodes. The noise used in this system
    was additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The system parameters included an average
    detection time of 10,000 and the presence of three auxiliary nodes. The spectrum
    detection method employed was energy detection. The cognitive radio topology is
    defined in Figure 4. The different number of primary and secondary users was placed
    in a particular geometry. The range of the network was between −500 to 500 m.
    There was one primary user and multiple secondary users. The primary user was
    located at the center of the area while the secondary users were located around
    the primary users within the specific pattern. The total error rate is depicted
    in Figure 5, commencing at 15% within the first second. Figure 5 shows that the
    total error rate progressively rose to 20.05% over a period of 2 s. Subsequently,
    there was a sudden decline, bringing the total error rate down to 10%. Figure
    4. Cognitive radio topology. Figure 5. Total error rate. Table 3. Specific simulation
    parameters. A similar Analysis of Security in Cognitive Radio is displayed in
    Figure 6. It tends to be seen from Figure 6 that when the NES and SSSB calculations
    are utilized in the mix, as expanding the number of associations between the detecting
    hub, combination focus and blockchain the board community, the security file of
    the psychological remote organization rises fundamentally quickly. Figure 7 depicts
    the analysis of the energy consumption in terms of the proposed algorithm vs.
    the NES algorithm. Figure 7 clearly demonstrates that when the number of detection
    cycles exceeded 60, the energy consumption associated with the algorithm presented
    in this study was markedly lower compared to that of the conventional algorithms.
    Increasing the number of detection cycles resulted in longer detection times,
    ultimately leading to greater energy conservation. This significantly benefitted
    the cognitive wireless network by extending its operational lifespan. The reason
    behind this was that the algorithm presented in this paper consistently selected
    the node with the optimal performance for timely participation in cooperative
    detection, thereby saving more energy when the detection performance surpassed
    that of the traditional methods. In comparison to the NES algorithm, the proposed
    algorithm demonstrated superior energy efficiency. The results for the organization
    of traffic are presented in Table 4. Query per second (QPS) assessments offer
    numerous advantages when examining traffic utilization. To illustrate that the
    new algorithm did not increase network overhead, a deliberate organization traffic
    test was conducted. The proposed solution outlined a protocol or algorithm used
    to manage network traffic within a blockchain network. It aimed to maintain optimal
    network performance by routing requests appropriately, monitoring traffic conditions,
    and ensuring timely responses. This test aimed to evaluate the algorithm without
    introducing any variables related to character data in this segment. Figure 6.
    Comparative analysis of security in cognitive radio. Figure 7. Analysis of the
    energy consumption: the proposed vs. NES algorithms. Table 4. Network traffic
    test results. Its primary objective was to compare network traffic disparities
    between remote gateways. If the traffic surpassed a certain predefined threshold,
    a specific action was taken, and the query or request was directly routed to the
    blockchain. This approach could be employed to alleviate network congestion or
    ensure that critical queries are handled promptly by the blockchain, bypassing
    any potential bottlenecks in the network. The selection of service nodes was also
    mentioned as a part of this process. Scenarios such as location spoofing, resource
    exhaustion attacks, authentication and key management vulnerabilities, rogue spectrum
    access points, primary user protection attacks, jamming attacks, spectrum sensing
    data falsification and primary user emulation illustrated the potential security
    risks in CRNs, emphasizing the need for robust security mechanisms, such as authentication,
    encryption, intrusion detection, and intrusion prevention, to mitigate these threats
    and ensure the safe and reliable operation of CRNs. The basic architecture, as
    discussed above, outlined the key components and processes for integrating blockchain
    into CRNs to enhance security and spectrum access management. By leveraging blockchain
    technology, CRNs can achieve greater transparency, trust, and efficiency in spectrum
    allocation and management while mitigating security risks. It’s essential to customize
    this architecture according to specific CRN use cases and regulatory frameworks.
    Integrating blockchain technology into CRNs can bring several benefits, but it
    also introduces potential overheads and performance trade-offs that network operators
    and architects need to consider. Integrating blockchain into CRNs can significantly
    enhance security and spectrum access management. Blockchain-enabled CRNs can offer
    both advantages and pose challenges in terms of aligning with current spectrum
    regulations and policies. While blockchain-enabled CRNs offer significant potential
    for enhancing spectrum management, there are hurdles to overcome in aligning these
    systems with current spectrum regulations and policies. Collaboration, adaptation,
    and a balanced approach to privacy and transparency are key to successfully integrating
    blockchain technology into the regulatory framework of CRNs. Mitigating security
    vulnerabilities in CRNs requires a multifaceted approach that combines technological,
    operational, and regulatory measures. By implementing practical strategies and
    countermeasures, such as authentication and authorization, spectrum sensing security,
    jamming detection and mitigation, primary user protection, secure spectrum allocation,
    intrusion detection, and response, redundancy and resilience, CRN operators can
    enhance the security and resilience of their networks. 5. Conclusions In real-world
    applications for cognitive wireless networks, it is common to encounter genuine
    errors in data detection through network nodes, leading to deviations from the
    expected range of detection values. Additionally, there are instances where some
    nodes intentionally transmit incorrect data to the central aggregation point.
    In response to these security concerns, this paper presents two key approaches:
    the NES algorithm and the secure spectrum sensing mechanism. The proposed techniques
    incorporate the user’s interaction history and connection distance, which are
    recorded as a public ledger and managed by a blockchain management system. The
    proposed algorithm facilitates the central aggregation point in selecting nodes
    with outstanding performance for cooperative sensing, thus enhancing the network’s
    security against malicious node attacks. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    wireless networks should accommodate surging growth in mobile data traffic and
    support an increasingly high density of wireless devices. Consequently, as the
    demand for spectrum continues to skyrocket, a severe shortage of spectrum resources
    for wireless networks will reach unprecedented levels of challenge in the near
    future. To deal with the emerging spectrum-shortage problem, dynamic spectrum
    access techniques have attracted a great deal of attention in both academia and
    industry. By exploiting the cognitive radio techniques, secondary users (SUs)
    are capable of accessing the underutilized spectrum holes of the primary users
    (PUs) to increase the whole system’s spectral efficiency with minimum interference
    violations. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the spectrum access problem
    for interweave cognitive radio networks, and propose a usage-aware deep reinforcement
    learning based scheme to solve it, which exploits the historical channel usage
    data to learn the time correlation and channel correlation of the PU channels.
    We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by extensive simulations
    in both uncorrelated and correlated PU channel usage cases. The evaluation results
    validate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of channel access success
    probability and SU-PU interference probability, by comparing it with ideal results
    and existing methods. Keywords: dynamic spectrum access; interweave cognitive
    radio; deep reinforcement learning; channel usage aware; spectral utilization

    data traffic has grown tremendously due to the increase of wireless communication
    terminals and spectrum-hungry applications. The monthly global data traffic reached
    77 exabytes in 2022, i.e., a seven-fold increase over 2017, which is predicted
    to reach 131 exabytes per month by 2024. This blossoming traffic demand is driving
    the need for either improved spectrum efficiency in traditional sub-6 GHz frequency
    band or the utilization of additional spectrum in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency
    bands. The wireless communication in mmWave band has a huge potential, however,
    its high blockage and scattering losses characteristics limit the mmWave band
    use cases. On the other hand, the spectrum resource below 6 GHz is comparatively
    easy to use for mobile communication systems. However, the frequency bands below
    6 GHz are already almost fully allocated to various existing wireless systems
    in a static and exclusive way, e.g., TV broadcasting, video camera services, radar
    systems, fixed satellite systems, etc. In the current spectrum allocation paradigm,
    some primary systems have extremely low spectral utilization efficiency, since
    they have a large amount of unutilized or underutilized spectrum resources in
    both time and space domains [1]. To this end, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) which
    is empowered by interweave cognitive radio techniques, has been widely investigated
    [2,3,4,5], in which the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to access the abundant
    spectrum holes i.e., whitespaces, in the licensed spectrum bands that belong to
    the primary users (PUs). Two kinds of DSA approaches have been extensively studied
    recently, i.e., database driven spectrum access approaches and opportunistic spectrum
    access approaches. In the database driven spectrum access approaches [6,7,8,9,10],
    the SU queries a spectrum database about the spectrum availability information
    before the channel access. The spectrum database could be either constructed by
    propagation models [6] or crowdsourced spectrum-sensing measurements [7,8,9,10].
    The main concern in this kind of approach is the database’s accuracy and high
    maintaining/updating cost. In opportunistic spectrum access approaches [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18],
    the SU senses or predicts the spectrum holes of PUs, and accesses them dynamically.
    Ideally, the PUs are oblivious of the presence of SUs, if the SUs do not cause
    any interference. This approach is cost-efficient but may suffer from severe interference
    if the sensing or predicting results are not accurate. The key issue for opportunistic
    spectrum access is to predict the PUs’ channel usage status, and thus let SU access
    a channel that most likely to be idle to minimize the interference ratio and maximize
    the system’s total spectral utilization ratio. To this end, neural network model
    based primary user activity prediction methods were proposed in [13,14,15], with
    the objective of reducing both the spectrum underutilization and interference
    violations. In [16], by assuming that the PUs’ channel occupancy pattern obeys
    an exponential ON-OFF time distribution, a predictive channel selection algorithm
    was proposed and implemented in a wireless test-bed. Without the assumption of
    channel usage patterns, model-free spectrum access methods have been extensively
    investigated by utilizing the learning algorithms, and the details of them will
    be introduced in Section 2. In our previous work [19], we investigated the dynamic
    channel access problem in a specific uncorrelated three-PUs scenario, and provided
    some preliminary results to validate the practicability of the proposed deep reinforcement
    learning based method. However, the method proposed in [19] is dedicated to a
    very specific case without formal formulation, and is hard to be extended to general
    channel access problem. Based on the idea and preliminary results in [19], in
    this work, we consider a general dynamic channel access problem in a multiple-PU
    single-SU interweave cognitive radio network, by taking consideration both correlated
    and uncorrelated PU channel usage patterns. We mathematically formulate this problem
    to an optimization problem with the goal of maximizing the spectrum access success
    ratio and minimizing the interference violation ratio. We propose a novel usage-aware
    spectrum access scheme by exploiting deep reinforcement learning technique [20],
    in which the SU acts as an agent who could learn the optimal channel access policy
    by interacting with the wireless environment in a trial-and-error manner. Specifically,
    the proposed scheme exploits a deeper historical channel usage data of PUs by
    a compressed status representation method, and uses a usage-status-aware reward
    function to solve the reward sparsity problem. Moreover, to reduce the interference
    probability when the whitespace of PU is very limited, an additional no access
    option is provided to further reduce the interference ratio. We perform extensive
    simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by using a new
    evaluation metric which is defined as the difference between the channel access
    success probability and the SU-PU interference probability. The evaluation results
    demonstrate that our proposed scheme constantly keeps a small gap between the
    ideal results and outperforms the existing methods significantly under different
    PU channel usage patterns. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
    2 introduces the related works. Section 3 describes the system model and preliminaries
    of reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Section
    4 presents the proposed scheme in detail. Finally Section 5 provides the evaluation
    results, and Section 6 draws the conclusions. 2. Related Work The underutilization
    of sub-6GHz frequency bands caused by current spectrum allocation policy has stimulated
    a flurry of research activities in opportunistic spectrum access. Besides the
    conventional dynamic programming [21] and game theory [22] based channel access
    approaches, model-free learning-based approaches are widely addressed. These researches
    intend to keep track of PUs’ channel usage status, and let SU either sense the
    most likely idle channel to avoid interference or access the most likely channel
    in a best-effort way with acceptable interference ratio. Specifically, reinforcement
    learning based opportunistic spectrum access methods have been employed recently,
    which formulates the channel access problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
    An optimal policy is derived to maximize the number of time slots with successfully
    secondarily used while constraining the interference caused to the PUs. In [23],
    the channel access problem was formulated as a multi-arm restless bandit process
    by assuming the system transition is known a priori, and a myopic spectrum access
    policy was proposed, which designs a sensing policy for channel selection to maximize
    the average reward. In [24], a restless Multi-armed bandit (MAB) based approach
    [24] was investigated for homogeneous channel scenarios without the requirements
    of system transition statistics. In [25], the spectrum sensing order problem in
    the scenario with idle spectrum across multiple network service providers was
    investigated, in which a discounted Thompson sampling method was proposed to address
    the formulated optimization task. In [26,27,28,29], with the assumption that the
    observable full system states, reinforcement learning based dynamic spectrum access
    approaches were proposed. In [30], a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic
    multi-channel access method was firstly proposed, which takes into consideration
    the partial observability. In [31], a deep actor-critic reinforcement learning
    method was proposed for spectrum sensing problem for both single user case and
    multiple users case. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning based distributed
    dynamic spectrum access scheme for multiple SUs was investigated in [32], which
    uses a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered
    or not as a reward. However, this work assumed that the channel utilizations for
    PUs are invariant. A deep recurrent Q-network-based dynamic spectrum access method
    for a scenario with multiple independent channels and multiple heterogeneous PUs
    was proposed in [33]. Aside from the aforementioned methods that focused on fixed
    time slot channel sensing, spectrum sensing with adaptive time slot structure
    have also been studied. In [34], the authors deduced the structure of optimal
    sensing interval policy for channels with hyper-exponential distribution OFF times
    through Markov decision process, and used dynamic programming framework to derive
    sub-optimal sensing interval policies. In [35], the authors addressed the problems
    of which channel to sense and how often to sense. Specifically, a reinforcement
    learning based channel selection method and a Bayesian skip sensing duration method
    were proposed. In [36], the authors considered the tradeoff between sensing and
    transmission, and proposed a deep reinforcement learning based spectrum sensing
    strategy with the goal of maximizing the expected achievable throughput of SU.
    In [37], a reservoir computing-based distributed spectrum access approach was
    proposed, which takes into consideration the spectrum sensing errors. 3. System
    Model and Preliminaries 3.1. System Model In this paper, we consider a conventional
    dynamic channel access model for the interweave cognitive radio network, where
    N PUs use N respective channels and a single SU tries to opportunistically access
    the whitespace of PUs for secondary use in a slot-by-slot manner. The PU channel
    usages could be either correlated or uncorrelated. In each time slot, the usage
    status of PU is represented by “−1” when it is busy and “1” when it is idle. The
    PU usage patterns can be characterized by two metrics, duty cycle (DC) and complexity
    [38]. DC indicates the activity level of PU, which is defined as the time ratio
    of its presence. Therefore, a high DC means less whitespace is available for secondary
    use. Complexity is an index showing the degree of irregularity in the channel
    usage by measuring the rate of production of new patterns. The complexity could
    be measured by the entropy rate given by Equation (1), which is defined as the
    expected value of the amount of information that increases when one random variable
    is added to the random variable sequence. ℎ=− ∑ 𝑖𝑗 𝛿 𝑖 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 log 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 . (1) In
    the context of this paper, 𝑝 𝑖𝑗 denotes the channel status transition rate, which
    includes 𝑝 00 , 𝑝 01 , 𝑝 10 , 𝑝 11 . 𝛿 1 represents the DC of PU’s channel usage,
    and 𝛿 0 =1− 𝛿 1 . The usage pattern of PU with large entropy rate indicates that
    it has high complexity and thus is hard to predict. The SU tries to predict all
    N channels usage status on the next time slot, and either access a channel that
    is most likely to be idle or retrain from channel accessing. If the channel that
    SU accessed is idle, the spectrum access succeeds and there has no interference
    between SU and PU. Otherwise, the spectrum access fails and SU-PU interference
    occurs. In this case, the SU must refrain from the channel accessing. Obviously,
    accurate channel usage prediction for the next time slot is the key to maximize
    the spectral utilization ratio and minimize the interference probability. 3.2.
    Preliminaries 3.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Q-Learning [39] is a representative
    reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal policy in an interactive
    environment by trial and error. By assuming discrete time, in time slot k, the
    agent observes the state 𝑠 𝑘 of the environment, and takes an action 𝑎 𝑘 based
    on a policy 𝜋 . Upon the action being taken, the state moves from 𝑠 𝑘 to 𝑠 𝑘+1
    , and the agent obtains a reward/cost 𝑟 𝑘 that indicates the benefit/loss by taking
    𝑎 𝑘 at 𝑠 𝑘 . The optimal action policy 𝜋 ∗ is computed by maximizing/minimizing
    the expectation of the future cumulative discounted reward/cost. In Q-learning,
    a Q-function is defined to represent the expected future cumulative discounted
    reward for action 𝑎 𝑘 under state 𝑠 𝑘 . The values of the Q-function, i.e., Q-value,
    are stored in a Q-table, whose size is the number of states times the number of
    actions. The Q-value in time slot k is updated by Equation (2). 𝑄 ′ ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎
    𝑘 ) = 𝑄 ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 ) +𝛼( 𝑟 𝑘 +𝛾 min 𝑎 𝑘+1 𝑄 ( 𝑠 𝑘+1 , 𝑎 𝑘+1 ) − 𝑄 ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘
    ) ), (2) where 𝑄 ′ ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 ) is the Q-value after update, 𝑄 ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 )
    is the current Q-value, 𝛼 is the learning rate which is in range 0≤𝛼≤1 , 𝑟 𝑘 is
    the cost, 𝛾 is the discount factor which is in range 0≤𝛾≤1 , and min 𝑎 𝑘+1 𝑄 (
    𝑠 𝑘+1 , 𝑎 𝑘+1) represents the minimum Q-value for the actions that the agent can
    select at next time slot 𝑘+1 under the new state 𝑠 𝑘+1 . Notice that in Equation
    (2), minimum Q-value is used, since 𝑟 𝑘 is a cost instead of a reward, i.e., smaller
    Q-value is more desirable. 3.2.2. Deep Reinforcement Learning When the spaces
    of state 𝑠 𝑘 and action 𝑎 𝑘 increase, the Q-table based classic Q-learning method
    may fail due to the so-called the curse of dimensionality problem, i.e., many
    state-action pairs are rarely visited and the storage of the table becomes impractical.
    To solve this problem, Deep Q-Network (DQN) [20] has been proposed, which approximates
    the Q-table by a neural network. By introducing a weight 𝜃 𝑘 of the DQN, the task
    of finding the best Q-function is transformed to search the best weight 𝜃 𝑘 .
    Therefore, the update of the Q-value is represented by Equation (3). 𝑄 ′ ( 𝑠 𝑘
    , 𝑎 𝑘 , 𝜃 𝑘 ) = 𝑄 ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 , 𝜃 𝑘 ) + 𝛼 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ (1−𝛾) 𝑟 𝑘 +𝛾 min 𝑎 𝑘+1 𝑄 (
    𝑠 𝑘+1 , 𝑎 𝑘+1 , 𝜃 𝑘 ̃ ) − 𝑄 ( 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 , 𝜃 𝑘+1 ) ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ . (3) A replay memory
    is used to store the latest U state-action-cost tuples, such as 𝜑={ 𝑚 (𝑘−𝑈+1)
    ,⋯, 𝑚 𝑘 } , where 𝑚 𝑘 ={ 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 , 𝑟 𝑘 , 𝑠 (𝑘+1) } . A mini-batch 𝜑 ̃ ∈𝜑 is
    sampled from the replay memory instead of the most recent experience to calculate
    the loss function, which is defined as the difference between a target Q value
    and the current Q value. The weight 𝜃 𝑘 of the neural network is updated by the
    gradient descent method. To make the training more stable, a target Q-network
    is used to back-propagate through and train the main Q-network. The loss function
    and the gradient are given by Equations (4) and (5), respectively. By utilizing
    DQN, the agent could learn the optimal Q-value for a state-action pair in a semi-online
    fashion. 𝐿( 𝜃 𝑘+1 )= 𝐸 { 𝑠 𝑘 , 𝑎 𝑘 , 𝑟 𝑘 , 𝑠 𝑘+1 }∈ 𝜑 ̃ [((1−𝛾) 𝑟 𝑘 +𝛾𝑄 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜

    (5) 4. Proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Usage Aware Spectrum Access
    Scheme In this section, we firstly mathematically formulate the dynamic spectrum
    access problem in a interweave cognitive radio network with multiple-PU and single-SU.
    Then, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based usage aware spectrum access
    scheme to let the SU predict the channel usage at next time slot and access the
    most likely idle channel. The goal of the proposal is to maximize the system spectral
    utilization efficiency and minimize the SU-PU interference violations. 4.1. Problem
    Formulation In this paper, we consider a typical spectrum access model with K
    PUs and single SU. The time is discretized into time slots, and the idle or busy
    status of PU does not change during one time slot. The status of total K PUs’
    channels at time slot t is denoted by 𝐬 𝑡 =[ 𝑠 𝑡 1 , 𝑠 𝑡 2 ,⋯, 𝑠 𝑡 𝐾 ] , where
    𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 =1 if the k-th PU’s channel is idle at time slot t, and 𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 =−1 if it
    is busy. At time slot t, SU determines whether accessing the channel or not and
    which channel to access if so. A channel access indicator at time slot t is represented
    by 𝐚 𝑡 =[ 𝑎 𝑡 1 , 𝑎 𝑡 2 ,⋯, 𝑎 𝑡 𝐾 ] , where 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 =1 if SU accesses the k-th channel
    at next time slot and 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 =0 otherwise. Notice that ∑ 𝐾 𝑘=1 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 ≤1 , which
    indicates that SU can at most access one channel at a time. Accessing an idle
    channel leads to a success spectrum reuse, and accessing a busy channel results
    in interference and thus the SU must refrain from accessing. The SU aims at finding
    a series of optimal channel access policy in total time slots T, so as to maximize
    the number of time slots that have been successfully accessed and minimize the
    number of time slots in which the interference occurred. The problem could be
    formulated as follows. max 𝐚 1 , 𝐚 2 ,⋯, 𝐚 𝑇 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 ( 𝐬 𝑡 ) 𝑇 𝐚 𝑡 , 𝑠.𝑡. ∑ 𝑘=1
    𝐾 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 ≤1, 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 ∈{0,1} (6) where the constraint indicates that the SU could
    at most access one channel for each time slot t. For each time slot t, the value
    of the objective function in Equation (6) has three possible cases, i.e., 1 when
    SU accesses an idle channel, 0 when SU refrains from channel access, and −1 when
    SU accesses a busy channel. 4.2. Existing Q-Learning and DQN Based Spectrum Access
    Methods Before presenting the proposed scheme, we briefly introduce the basic
    idea of the existing Q-learning and DQN based spectrum access methods. The Q-Learning
    based spectrum access method uses the channel usage status at current time slot
    t of different PUs as the states for learning. An illustrative example with 3
    PUs is shown in Figure 1a. If at time slot t, the status of channels #1,#2,#3
    are busy, busy and idle, respectively, the states will be recorded by vector [−1,−1,1]
    . The action will be the index of the channel that SU intends to access at next
    time slot 𝑡+1 . For instance, 𝐚 𝑡 =[0,0,1] indicates that SU will access channel
    #3 at next time slot. If the channel that SU intends to access at time slot 𝑡+1
    is idle, the spectrum secondary use succeeds and the system’s total spectral utilization
    ratio improves. Otherwise, if the channel that SU accesses at time slot 𝑡+1 is
    busy, the channel access fails since the interference occurs. The cost value is
    defined as 0 if the channel access succeeds, or 1 otherwise. Figure 1. An illustration
    of the state definitions for the existing methods. (a) Q-learning based spectrum
    access method. (b) DQN based spectrum access method. In the DQN based spectrum
    access method, the historical channel usage status is used as the states for learning.
    The original Q-table based learning method cannot exploit the historical data,
    since it leads to a tremendous increase of the state-action space. For instance,
    in the same scenario that the number of PUs is 3, if the past channel usage status
    back to time slot 𝑡−4 is applied, the number of states will increase rapidly from
    2×2×2=8 to (2×2×2) 5 =32,768 . Hopefully, the DQN algorithm approximates the Q-table
    by neural network, and thus is capable of dealing with complicated scenario with
    huge state-action space. We briefly explain the DQN based spectrum access method
    by using the same PU = 3 example. Instead of only using the current time slot
    t’s status, the historical channel usage status back to time slot 𝑡−4 is applied.
    For the example channel usage history that given in Figure 1b, the state matrix
    can be represented as [1,1,−1;1,−1,−1;−1,−1,1; 1,−1,1;−1,1,−1] . Here, the first
    row records 1,1,−1 represent the usage status for channels #1,#2,#3 at time slot
    𝑡−4 , the second row records 1,−1,−1 represent the usage status for channels #1,#2,#3
    at time slot 𝑡−3 , and so on. Action set and cost value are similarly defined
    as that in the Q-learning based spectrum access method described above. Specifically,
    the action set has three possible actions since there are three channels and,
    the cost value is set to 0 when the channel access succeeds, and the cost is set
    to 1 when the channel access fails. 4.3. Proposed Usage Aware Spectrum Access
    Scheme In this subsection, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning based
    usage aware spectrum access scheme. To improve the training performance, a double
    Q-network architecture is applied, in which one is used to determine the action
    and another is used to evaluate the action. Furthermore, a replay memory is utilized,
    and the agent randomly gathers a mini-batch from the replay memory, and uses it
    to update the neural network to approximate the Q-value function. The proposed
    scheme improves the previous existing methods in three aspects: compressed states
    representation, additional action and status aware cost functions. 4.3.1. Compressed
    States Representation In the existing Q-learning and DQN based spectrum access
    methods, the state vector and matrix directly record the current and historical
    PU channel usage status. Specifically, 1 or −1 represents a specific channel for
    a specific time slot is idle or busy, respectively. In this paper, in order to
    exploit a deeper historical PU usage status with a same state matrix size, we
    propose a compressed state representation method, in which the number of continuous
    channel status and the current channel status are recorded. To facilitate better
    understanding, Figure 2 shows an example of how the proposed compressed states
    represents the current and historical channel usages in a three-PU-channels scenario.
    The compressed state is a matrix, in which each column records the channel usage
    information of a specific channel. The last row, i.e., “101” in the example, represents
    the latest channel usage status for three channels, i.e., 𝑠 𝑡 1 , 𝑠 𝑡 2 , 𝑠 𝑡
    3 . Notice that “−1” which denotes busy is changed to “0” in the state matrix
    to let all the elements in the state matrix non-negative, and the remaining rows
    record the number of consecutive “−1” (busy) and “1” (idle) alternately for different
    channels. For instance, the usage status for channel #1 at time slots 𝑡−3,𝑡−2,𝑡−1,𝑡
    , i.e., 𝑠 𝑡−3 1 , 𝑠 𝑡−2 1 , 𝑠 𝑡−1 1 , 𝑠 𝑡 1 , are recorded as 4 in the compressed
    state matrix. The total size of the compressed states matrix is fixed, therefore,
    once the channel status is switched twice, the oldest information on the first
    and second rows is deleted, and the records following behind will be shifted forward.
    By using the proposed compressed states representation, more information regarding
    the historical channel usages could be recorded by the same size of state matrix.
    Figure 2. An illustration of the proposed compressed states representation. 4.3.2.
    Additional Action In the existing methods, the SU must take an action to choose
    and access a channel at the next time slot. However, in the scenario that the
    DCs of all the PU channel usages are high, the available whitespace is limited
    and thus interference between SU and PU is extremely hard to avoid. To this end,
    we add an additional “no access” action to the action set. Specifically, 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘
    =0 indicates that the SU refrains from accessing channel k at the next time slot,
    therefore | 𝐚 𝑡 |=0 denotes that the SU does not access any channel at next time
    slot. 4.3.3. Status Aware Cost Function In the existing Q-learning and DQN based
    spectrum access methods, the cost is set to either “0” or “1” depending on the
    channel access is successful or not. This cost setting has two problems. The first
    one is that the sparse cost value setting has a negative impact on the learning
    process and may result in an unstable learning result. The second one is that
    the cost setting has not taken into consideration the no access case. To this
    end, in the proposed scheme, the cost functions are delicately designed, which
    has several discrete values based on the PU channel usage status and SU’s actions.
    The cost value is assigned based on the state-action pair’s “inappropriate level”.
    The basic idea is that, the most appropriate one is assigned to a cost value equals
    to 0, and the most inappropriate one is assigned to a cost value equals to 1.
    Specifically, the cost value calculation for all the possible state-action pairs
    is defined in Equation (7), which is related to the PU channel usage status and
    SU’s corresponding actions. For instance, choosing no access action when all the
    channels are idle is more inappropriate compared with that when only one channel
    is idle. 𝐶 𝑡 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨       𝑁 𝛿 𝑁 , 𝑁 𝛿 2(𝑁−1) +0.5, 0, | 𝐚 𝑡 |=0 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 =1&
    𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 =−1 𝑎 𝑡 𝑘 =1& 𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 =1 (7) Here, 𝑁 𝛿 and N denote the numbers of idle channels
    and total channels, respectively. 𝑁 𝛿 could be easily derived by measuring the
    total received power. Notice that 𝑁 𝛿 is required only when the SU does not access
    the channel or it has to refrain from accessing due to interference occurring.
    Specifically, if SU chooses the no access action, the cost value will increase
    in proportion to the number of idle channels. If SU chooses to access the channel
    k, and unfortunately interference occurs, the cost will proportionally increase
    with the number of idle channels in the range [0.5,1] . Finally, if SU chooses
    to access the channel k, and channel k is idle, then the cost will be 0. A flowchart
    to illustrate the proposed status aware cost function design is given by Figure
    3. Figure 3. An flowchart of the proposed status aware cost function. 5. Simulation
    Results 5.1. Simulation Settings In the simulation, we considered a typical interweave
    cognitive radio network with multiple PUs and single SU. Regarding the PU channels,
    both the traditional correlated channels and extremely challenging uncorrelated
    channels are considered. Various DCs and complexities for the PU channel usages
    are adopted. The DC varies in range [0.1,0.9] . For each DC, nine patterns of
    data with different complexities are used, and the complexity is measured by entropy
    rate that given by Equation (1). The entropy rates for each DC are shown in Table
    1. From pattern 𝜂 1 to pattern 𝜂 9 , the complexities gradually increase. An example
    of the PU channel usages for DC = 0.5 with pattern 𝜂 1 and pattern 𝜂 9 are illustrated
    in Figure 4. It is obvious that the channel usage pattern 𝜂 1 with low complexity
    is much easier to predict compared with pattern 𝜂 9 . Figure 4. A channel usage
    example for 3 PU channels (DC = 0.5). (a) Pattern 𝜂 1 . (b) Pattern 𝜂 9 . Table
    1. Entropy rates for different patterns at each DC. To validate the performance
    of the proposed scheme, we compare it with the ideal results, random channel access
    method, Q-learning based method [26], and DQN based method [30]. The ideal result
    is obtained by assuming that the SU has the perfect knowledge of all PUs’ channel
    usage status at all future time slots, which provides an upperbound for the performance
    evaluation. The random channel access method is a baseline method, in which the
    SU randomly picks a channel and accesses it at the next time slot. The Q-learning
    and DQN learning based methods are introduced in Section 4.2. The proposed scheme’s
    major parameters are summarized in Table 2. We use Matlab [40] to generate the
    channel usage time series with different DCs and complexities, and Python [41]
    to derive the ideal result and realize the proposed scheme, the DQN-based method,
    the Q-learning based method and the random channel access method. Table 2. Main
    parameters for the proposed method. In this paper, we aim at maximizing the SU’s
    channel access success probability and minimizing the SU-PU interference probability
    simultaneously. Therefore, we define a new evaluation metric, i.e., 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖
    , which is the channel access success probability 𝑃 𝑠 , minus the SU-PU interference
    probability 𝑃 𝑖 . The range of the evaluation metric 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 will be from −1
    to 1. In real applications, PU will inform the interfering SU to refrain from
    transmitting once the interference is occurred. 5.2. Evaluation Results for Correlated
    Channel Usages First, we validate the proposed method in correlated channel usages
    cases. In this setting, 10 PU channels are evenly divided into two groups, i.e.,
    𝐺 1 with five channels and 𝐺 2 with five channels. In each group, the channels’
    idle and busy states changes with the same pattern. To keep the total DC as 0.5,
    we consider three kinds of combination for 𝐺 1 and 𝐺 2 , specifically DC( 𝐺 1
    ) = 0.1 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.9; DC( 𝐺 1 ) = 0.3 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.7; DC( 𝐺 1 ) =
    0.5 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.5. First, Figure 5a illustrates the results of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖
    for different DC combinations. It is obvious that the ideal results are always
    1, since the channel access success probability is 100% and the SU-PU interference
    probability is 0% . The random channel access method could only achieve 𝑃 𝑠 −
    𝑃 𝑖 =0 , since its channel access success probability and SU-PU interference probability
    are both 50% . For the proposed method, it could achieve almost the same performance
    as the ideal results for all three duty cycle combinations, which indicates that
    both the time correlation and channel correlation of the PU channels are well
    learned. On the other hand, the performance of two existing methods, i.e., the
    Q-learning based method and the DQN-based method, varies from 0.31 to 0.82 at
    different duty cycle combinations, and the DQN-based methods performs slightly
    better than Q-learning based method. Figure 5. 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 for correlated PU channels
    (No. of PU = 10). (a) Different DCs for groups 𝐺 1 and 𝐺 2 . (b) Different patterns
    when DC( 𝐺 1 ) = 0.1 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.9. (c) Different patterns when DC( 𝐺 1
    ) = 0.3 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.7. (d) Different patterns when DC( 𝐺 1 ) = 0.5 and DC(
    𝐺 2 ) = 0.5. Next, Figure 5b–d shows the results of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 at different DC
    combinations with varying complexities. Firstly as expected, the performance of
    the ideal results and random channel access method keeps constant regardless of
    the complexities. Moreover, it is clear that the performance of the proposed method
    also does not change with PU channel usage complexities, which achieves almost
    similar results with ideal results at all complexities. However, it is obvious
    that the two existing methods’ performance degrades as the PU channel usage complexity
    increases, especially for the DC( 𝐺 1 ) = 0.5 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.5 case, and the
    DQN-based method achieves more stable performance compared with Q-leaning based
    method. We can observe that the Q-learning based method fails to predict the channel
    state completely at some scenarios, e.g., 𝜂 3 , 𝜂 5 , 𝜂 7 and 𝜂 8 when DC( 𝐺 1
    ) = 0.5 and DC( 𝐺 2 ) = 0.5. 5.3. Evaluation Results for Uncorrelated Channel
    Usages Next, we compare the performance of different methods in an uncorrelated
    channel usage scenario. First, we show the performance in terms of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 in
    a 3 PU channel scenario in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows the results of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖
    varying with DC from 0.1 to 0.9 . As expected, when the DC of the PUs increases,
    it becomes more difficult for the SU to access the channel successfully without
    interference violation for all the channel access methods. Even for the ideal
    results, the 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 decreases from 1 to 0.26 when the DC increases from 0.1
    to 0.9. For the random channel access method, the performance linearly degrades
    from 0.8 to −0.8 when the DC increases from 0.1 to 0.9. Regarding the two existing
    methods, they could only achieve limited improvements compared with random channel
    access scheme, and the DQN-based scheme performs constantly better than the Q-learning
    method, since historical channel usage status is utilized. Besides the ideal results,
    it is obvious that the proposed scheme performs the best, which keeps a small
    performance gap to the ideal results. The gap becomes larger when the DC increases,
    since the whitespace is extremely limited for the cases that DC is 0.7 and 0.9.
    However, the proposed scheme still significantly outperforms the two existing
    methods at all DC values. When the DC is low, i.e., 0.1 and 0.3, we consider that
    the improvements mainly come from two aspects. One is the proposed compressed
    states representation scheme which results in learning with deeper historical
    channel usage status. Another is the proposed usage aware cost function design
    which reduces the cost value’s sparsity. When the DC is high, i.e., 0.5, 0.7 and
    0.9, we can confirm that the proposed scheme has a further performance improvements
    compared to the existing methods. Aside from the two previously mentioned aspects,
    we consider the reason is that the additional “no access” action provides SU a
    new option to avoid interference by refraining from channel access. Figure 6.
    𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 for uncorrelated PU channels (No. of PU = 3). (a) Varying DCs. (b) Different
    patterns when DC = 0.1. (c) Different patterns when DC = 0.3. (d) [Different patterns
    when DC = 0.5. (e) Different patterns when DC = 0.7. (f) Different patterns when
    DC = 0.9. Figure 6b–f show the results of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 at different DC by varying
    the complexities of the PU channel usage patterns. As expected, the ideal results
    and the performance of random channel access method keep constant regardless of
    the complexities. On the other hand, the performance of the two existing methods
    degrades as the PU’s channel usage complexity increases. This performance variation
    becomes large when the DC increases. For the high DC and high complexity cases,
    i.e., 𝜂 7 ∼ 𝜂 9 when 𝐷𝐶=0.7 and 𝜂 5 ∼ 𝜂 9 when 𝐷𝐶=0.9 , their performance degrades
    to the same level as the random channel access method, which indicates that the
    learning has failed and the prediction results are not helpful. It is confirmed
    that the proposed scheme keeps a constant gap to the ideal results at all DCs
    for all the patterns with different complexities. The performance of the proposed
    scheme is not affected by the complexities. It performs well even in very challenging
    scenarios with high DC and high complexity. Finally, we present the performance
    evaluation results for a very challenging 10 uncorrelated PU channel scenario
    in Figure 7. Figure 7a shows the results of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 with varying DC from 0.1
    to 0.9. Compared with the results for three PU channels scenario that is illustrated
    in Figure 6a, the performance of the proposed scheme degrades considerably, since
    the environment becomes extremely complicated and thus the state-action space
    increases exponentially. Specifically, the proposed scheme’s 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 can only
    achieve approximately 0 when the DC is 0.7 or 0.9, which means that it is hard
    for the SU to predict the whitespace and it prefers no access action to avoid
    interference. The performance of the Q-learning based method is almost the same
    as the random access method, which means it cannot deal with such complicated
    scenario. Figure 7b–f show the results of 𝑃 𝑠 − 𝑃 𝑖 at different DC by varying
    the complexities of the PU channel usage patterns. When the DC of PUs is 0.1 ,
    all the methods show the similar performance regardless of the complexities. For
    the cases that DCs of PU are 0.3 and 0.5 , the proposed scheme can achieve comparatively
    satisfied performance compared with other schemes in all patters. The DQN-based
    method performs well in low complexity patterns, however, its performance degrades
    a lot when the complexity increases. Finally, when the DCs of PU are 0.7 and 0.9
    , accessing the channel without interference becomes extremely challenging. The
    learning results of the proposed method suggests the SU chooses no access action
    to avoid interference. Furthermore the Q-learning based and DQN-based methods
    have a great number of interference especially when the complexity is high. Figure

    when DC = 0.9. 6. Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a novel deep reinforcement
    learning based usage aware spectrum access scheme for a typical multiple PUs and
    single SU cognitive radio network. Specifically, the proposed scheme consists
    of three key techniques which are compressed state representation, additional
    action option and status aware cost function design. By learning both the time
    and channel correlations of the PU channels, the proposed scheme is capable of
    reducing the spectrum underutilization and interference violations. We performed
    extensive simulations by considering both uncorrelated and correlated channel
    scenarios, and compared the performance of the proposed scheme with existing schemes
    and ideal results. The evaluation results showed that when PU = 3, the proposed
    scheme keeps a constant small performance gap between the ideal results, and significantly
    outperforms the existing methods especially at high PUs’ DC and complexity cases,
    e.g., a 3.28 times performance improvement over existing two schemes when DC =
    0.9. However, regarding the results when PU = 10, the performance of the proposed
    scheme degrades significantly. In the worst case, i.e., when DC = 0.7, only a
    1.22 times performance improvement over DQN-based method is obtained. For the
    future research, we plan to improve the performance of the proposed method in
    complicated scenarios by using deeper neural networks, and extend the proposed
    approach to combined channel access scenario and evaluate it by using real data
    traffic traces. Author Contributions Conceptualization, X.W., M.U. and Y.J.; methodology,

    The fifth generation (5G) mobile network is on its way with the goal of achieving
    an ultra reliable communication (URC), whenever and wherever needed and utilizing
    the radio spectrum efficiently. This goal embraces the use of emerging wireless
    applications, however, with static spectrum allocation and limited bandwidth,
    current cellular networks cannot achieve it. Therefore, in order to provide reliable
    and heterogeneous services to massive devices and applications in 5G networks,
    more flexible and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is desired. As part of the 5G
    paradigm, cognitive radio (CR) is envisaged as a key enabler which can deal with
    the challenge of URC and alleviate the issue of spectrum scarcity. URC refers
    to the provision of a certain level of communication service almost 100% of the
    time with higher degrees of availability and reliability [1]. Thus, investigating
    the availability and reliability aspects of cognitive radio network (CRN) from
    a dependability theory perspective is of paramount importance to its successful
    operation in the near future. A CRN aims to support highly reconfigurable devices
    that are capable of sensing the current environment and can dynamically adjusting
    their power, frequency, modulation, and other operating parameters such as antenna
    beam pattern [2], [3]. These efforts have laid down rules for sharing the spectrum
    in various novel and promising applications such as emergency networks, vehicular
    networks, public safety networks. DSA allows effective use of radio frequency
    and prevents its under-utilization in many real world networks. It enables secondary
    user (SUs) to opportunistically access the unoccupied licensed spectrum owned
    by primary users (PUs) [4], [5]. While the immense benefits of CRN are self-evident,
    the realization of CRNs’ full potential requires development of advanced methodologies,
    techniques and algorithms. Queueing theory has proved to be a very powerful mathematical
    tool for such a development, appropriate analytical modeling and performance analysis
    of corresponding complex system. Several queueing systems are analyzed in the
    literature as model of CRNs, wherein as a rule, it is suggested that PUs have
    preemptive priority over SUs. In contrast to other wireless networks, CRNs are
    thus more prone to channel access failures from SU network’s point of view. In
    general, channels in CRN could be unavailable for PUs and SUs owing to two fundamental
    reasons, i.e. (1) for PUs if the spectrum is already occupied by other PUs and
    for SUs if the spectrum is already occupied by other PUs and/or SUs in the system;
    and (2) a channel itself could fail due to software malfunctioning, hardware failure,
    channel fading, and shadowing. Various techniques have been proposed in the literature
    to improve the performance of CRNs (see, e.g. [6], [7]). However, therein, the
    main focus is merely by considering resource insufficiency due to traffic conditions.
    To date, little work has been done regarding the investigation of channel failures
    and recovery due to the complexity of analysis. Indeed, those failures have a
    direct impact on the performance of the CRNs since it may decrease the network
    capacity and may degrade the response time for a service request. Thus, ignorance
    of the impact of channel failure generally overestimates the performance measures.
    To perform a realistic reliability analysis, it is thus required to consider performance
    changes that are associated with channel failures. In the context of a communication
    system, dependability is governed by its capacity to deliver services that can
    justifiably be trusted when its components are prone to failures (see, e.g. [8],
    [9]). The theory to analyze such a phenomenon is called dependability theory [10]
    in the research community. Once channel failure occurs, an ongoing PUs’ transmission
    can also be terminated before the completion of its service. However, forced termination
    of PUs has not been investigated fully in CRNs. A comprehensive set of terms and
    definitions based on dependability attributes and QoS are presented by the International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU) in its recommendation E.800 [11]. Retainability
    which is obtained as one minus the forced termination probability is considered
    to be a key performance indicator (KPI) [12]. To provide URC services in 5G networks
    from a dependability perspective, it is essential to analyze the dependability
    attributes of such a system since dependability metrics describe quantitatively
    the fundamental properties upon which a system can operate satisfactorily. The
    fact that a network connection is of finite duration and steady-state might never
    be reached. Therefore, the performance metrics under steady-state are inadequate
    and are often inappropriate in conditions when the time horizon of operations
    is finite [13]. Most authors have studied the stationary performance of CRNs.
    The popularity of stationary analysis comes from its simplicity and thus the available
    results of the transient regime are usually restricted due to its complexity [14],
    [15]. However, it is of vital importance to conduct transient analysis to predict
    the queueing as well as reliability indices of real-time CRNs. In addition, the
    evolving 5G networks are envisioned to provide services that have different Quality
    of Service (QoS) [16]. As observed, most works on performance analysis of dynamic
    channel access in CRNs have simply ignored or partially explored the consideration
    of heterogeneous users. However, for the practical and realistic CRN, it is imperative
    to analyze and investigate the heterogeneous SUs consideration, because of its
    significance. To support diverse services, we model a CRN which serves for both
    real-time SUs (RSUs) and elastic SUs (ESUs). With regards to the priority mechanism,
    PUs are always given the highest priority over SUs. For SUs, since RSUs are sensitive
    to transmission delay, they are given priority to access the available channels
    once they are admitted in the network using spectrum handover. Accordingly, a
    channel reservation scheme is proposed to mitigate their forced terminations because
    of channel failures and insufficient resources. Moreover, RSUs are given priority
    over ESUs in case of preemption upon PU arrival. Since prioritization may greatly
    hinder the communication of elastic traffic, the phenomenon of retrial transmission
    for leveraging the ESUs’ performance is considered in this model. Furthermore,
    to find more practical network managerial insights, balking (refuse to join the
    retrial orbit) and reneging (leave the orbit after joining) of ESUs is also taken
    into account so as to investigate their impatient behavior. The main contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows. 1. The impact of random channel failures
    and their recovery on CRN supporting heterogeneous secondary traffic is investigated
    to obtain more realistic results of performance evaluation. 2. An in-depth dependability
    theory-based analysis for system availability and reliability is performed considering
    different dependability attributes, which could help to find means for providing
    services and achieving URC. 3. The joint use of channel reservation and retrial
    policy is proposed and tested to mitigate the forced termination and blocking
    of services. 4. The transient dynamics of the system is investigated to capture
    short-term behavior of the CRN which portray more practical queueing scenarios.
    In a realistic scenario, such model could help the network service provider to
    dimension a network by: justifying secondary services, structuring these at a
    reasonable QoS including availability and reliability, and establishing the limits
    of channel reservation or retrial. The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, an overview of the related work is given. In Section 3, we describe
    the system model together with the assumptions. Section 4 presents the proposed
    DSA scheme. An extensive analytical model based on multi-dimensional CTMC is given
    in Section 5. Following this, in Section 6, we obtain the solution for the transient
    probabilities and derive some performance indices of the system. In Section 7,
    we present and discuss the main numerical results and thereafter conclude the
    paper in Section 8. 2. Related work Most of the previous works on CRN are focused
    on aspects such as dynamic spectrum access and spectrum sensing (see, e.g. [17],
    [18]). Few studies exist in the literature which explore the significance of channel
    failures when evaluating the performance of CRNs. However, most of those examined
    system centric performance analysis instead of the analysis from the perspectives
    of dependability theory. With the focus on the topology of CRN, the authors in
    [19] investigated the spreading of random failures. While therein correlations
    among failures and cascading effects are studied, the analysis of failure statistics
    is confined. A retransmission-based secondary access mechanism was proposed in
    [20] to improve the performance of PU and SU services by taking into account the
    event of transmission failures. Therein, the SU throughput maximization was the
    main objective of authors however, the forced termination of ongoing transmissions
    was not considered. Rather, the authors in  [21] investigated forced termination
    and blocking probability analysis by taking into account both resource insufficiency
    and link unreliability, wherein interrupted and blocked services are lost. However,
    in practice, interrupted and blocked users may retry again. From this point of
    view, appropriate retrial queueing models might be useful for cognitive systems.
    Retrials are characterized by the feature that a user who is unable to obtain
    service, joins an orbit (a fictitious queue) and make repeated attempts for service.
    Recently, retrial queueing models in CRN are receiving increasing attention which
    are more appropriate to characterize the impersistent and impatient behavior of
    SUs. Such studies include [22], [23], [24], [25], however, wherein very few of
    them have taken the balking and reneging phenomenon into account. To improve spectrum
    utilization in CRNs, some researchers have also emphasized on channel reservation
    mechanisms. A channel reservation scheme for PUs is developed by [26] where a
    certain number of channels are reserved for PUs. However, by employing this policy,
    forced terminations of SUs may not be decreased substantially. Note however that
    none of the above related work is targeted at performing reliability or availability
    analysis from a dependability perspective. Recently, to investigate the performance
    from dependability theory perspectives, a DSA scheme with channel reservation
    was proposed by [27] which was later modified by [28] to investigate the heterogeneity
    of failures. Nevertheless, none of them have dealt with the heterogeneity of SUs,
    while heterogeneity of users is a valuable feature as each arriving SU carries
    a distinct job and may differ in delay sensitivity. Besides, the transient dynamics
    of the system is also not investigated. Despite the relevance of transient analysis
    for a communication network, the literature on transient state network analysis
    is sparse due to the fact that transient state queuing analysis pursued so far
    quickly becomes intractable. However, considering the aspects not fully covered
    by the aforementioned previous studies, in this paper, we deal with the transient
    analysis of a multi-channel CRN. The main interest of the present paper is to
    perform a realistic reliability analysis by investigating the transient dynamics
    of error-prone CRNs from a dependability theory perspective. More specifically,
    this paper evaluates the impact of random channel failures on CRN system supporting
    heterogeneous traffic, in terms of dependability measures and investigate the
    advantages of joint use of channel reservation and retrial phenomenon on such
    CRNs’ performance. 3. Network scenario and assumptions We consider a centralized
    CRN architecture that allocates spectrum resources for both PUs and SUs. In addition,
    our system facilitates heterogeneous SU flows, i.e. low priority traffic or elastic
    traffic, and high priority traffic or real-time traffic. Herein, the abbreviations
    ESU and RSU denote elastic and real-time traffic respectively whereas for the
    convenience, the term SU denotes both SU flows. The total licensed spectrum band
    in the CRN is divided into equal bandwidth channels. Each channel is subject to
    different kinds of failures that could interrupt ongoing transmissions. As an
    essential measure, in order to avoid forced terminations, out of these channels,
    a small number of channels, , are reserved. However, the reservation of channels
    for ongoing interrupted services will record an increase in the blocking probability
    as a consequence. Moreover, due to under-utilization of channels, the reservation
    will degrade the overall capacity. To reduce this capacity loss and blocking for
    new user requests, we set an upper bound on as where the parameter limits the
    value of and . The set of reserved channels is denoted by R-CRN whereas that of
    non-reserved channels is denoted as NR-CRN, as depicted in Fig. 1. These reserved
    channels can only be accessed by the interrupted RSUs and PUs as a result of channel
    failures or the RSUs that are preempted upon PU arrivals. The reason for applying
    such restriction is to maintain a higher retainability level for established connections,
    which is one of the main KPIs in future wireless systems such as 5G. Furthermore,
    the RSU services have priority over the ESU services in case of preemption of
    a SU service upon PU arrival i.e. the ongoing ESUs are subject to termination
    prior to the RSUs. In order to protect the blocked and preempted/interrupted ESU
    services by the preemptive priority mechanism and channel failures, an infinite
    retrial orbit is employed for later retrial transmission. The nomenclature is
    given in Table 1. Moreover, to develop the analytical model presented in Section
    5, we made the following assumptions as the basis. Download : Download high-res

    illustration of the proposed DSA scheme when an occupied channel failed. • The
    arrival of users follow Poisson processes with rates , and for PU, ESU and RSU
    services respectively. And the service times for PU, ESU, and RSU services are
    exponentially distributed with corresponding service rates , and respectively.
    • The channel failure is generated by an exponential distribution with rate per
    channel in both NR-CRN and R-CRN. Also, we assume that both occupied and idle
    channels are vulnerable to failures. • As soon as a channel fails, the failed
    channel undergoes for repair immediately. The repair time of a failed channel
    in both NR-CRN and R-CRN is assumed to have an exponential distribution, with
    a repair rate per channel . • For ESU, a blocked service due to lack of capacity
    or system failure either enters the retrial orbit with probability or balks the
    system with complementary probability . While the users staying in the orbit,
    some impatient users may depart from the system when they make service attempts
    and finds no channel available. This queueing phenomenon is referred to as reneging.
    That is, if the retrial customer finds all the channels in the NR-CRN busy or
    failed, then it either returns to the orbit with probability or reneges the system
    with probability . Moreover, an interrupted service due to channel failure or
    a preempted service upon PU arrival joins the orbit with probability or leaves
    the system with probability ( ). Note that is used to represent the degree of
    impatience of ESU services. • The classical retrial policy, wherein the retrial
    rate is proportional to the number of users in the orbit is taken into account
    with truncation [29]. The reason being that though the orbit is of infinite capacity,
    the number of users utilizing the system is finite for most of the applications.
    The random time of successive repeated attempts made by every orbiting ESU is
    exponentially distributed with parameter . The retrial rate being proportional
    to the number of ESUs in the orbit is given by , where denotes the maximum number
    of orbiting customers allowed to make retrials. • The inter-arrival times, service
    times, inter-retrial times, and repair times are independent of each other. •
    The spectrum adaptation and sensing latency is negligible in contrast with the
    duration between two consecutive events. Herein, the events indicate PUs’ and
    SUs’ arrivals or departures. 4. The proposed dynamic spectrum access scheme In
    this section, we provide details of the channel access procedure adopted upon
    the occurrence of six events. The DSA scheme with those six events is partly illustrated
    in a flow chart in Fig. 2. (1) PU Arrival: If a new PU arrives and finds a vacant
    channel available in the NR-CRN, the arriving PU can commence transmission on
    that vacant channel. In the case where all the channels are occupied in the NR-CRN
    while at least one channel is occupied by an ESU, then one of those ESUs is preempted
    and that channel is re-allocated to the newly arriving PU, as indicated in Fig.
    3. The preempted ESU performs handover to another idle channel in NR-CRN, if available,
    otherwise, it either leaves the system with probability ( ) or joins the orbit
    with probability for later retrial. Moreover, if the arriving PU finds all the
    channels occupied by PUs or RSUs in the NR-CRN, then one of the RSUs in the NR-CRN
    is preempted. The preempted RSU is allowed to access the R-CRN, where the channels
    are reserved for those ongoing PU and RSU services which get interrupted and do
    not find any other channel in the NR-CRN. Accordingly, the preempted RSU performs
    spectrum handover to a vacant channel in the whole CRN, if available, otherwise,
    it is forced to terminate. As mentioned earlier, the reason for the above mentioned
    priority mechanism is to preserve ongoing RSUs’ transmissions prior to that of
    the ESUs. However, if the entire NR-CRN is occupied by PUs and/or failed, then
    a new PU request gets blocked. (2) SU Arrival: When a new SU (either ESU or RSU)
    arrives, the system allocates a vacant channel to the newly arriving SU from the
    NR-CRN, if it exists. Otherwise, the new RSU request is blocked whereas the new
    ESU request either joins the retrial orbit with probability or balks from the
    system with probability ( ), as presented in Fig. 3. Moreover, there is no provision
    of exploring the channel availability in the R-CRN for a new SU. Since PUs being
    of highest priority over the channels in NR-CRN, hence ongoing PU services cannot
    be preempted by the newly arrived SU. Further, when an ESU service in the orbit
    retries to access the system, the ESU repeats the same process as a newly arriving
    ESU, however with different rate (retrial rate). That is, if upon retrial attempt,
    the ESU service finds no channel available for its transmission, then it rejoins
    the orbit with probability or reneges the system with probability ( ). (3) PU/SU
    Departure: A departure event of a PU or a SU service from the NR-CRN or the R-CRN
    merely creates a vacant channel, as depicted in Fig. 2. And after a departure
    of any service from the system, no handover actions are performed. The reason
    is as follows. Upon a user departure from the NR-CRN, if an ongoing RSU in the
    R-CRN would have handed over to the NR-CRN, the channel occupancy of the NR-CRN
    would increase, which, in turn, would increase the blocking probability of SUs.
    In addition, such a handover process would result in additional control traffic
    in the system and additional complexity in our CTMC model. (4) Channel Failure:
    When a vacant channel in the NR-CRN (R-CRN) fails, the number of channels available
    in the NR-CRN (R-CRN) is decreased by one. It follows that the total number of
    available channels in the system get accordingly decreased by one. On the other
    hand, if an occupied channel in the R-CRN or NR-CRN fails, the interrupted user
    may perform a spectrum handover procedure, as illustrated in Fig. 4. This is performed
    based on the priority levels assigned to PUs and SUs in the NR-CRN and R-CRN.
    In the proposed scheme, the ongoing PUs in the R-CRN have the highest priority
    whereas the RSUs in the R-CRN are regarded with the second highest priority. Furthermore,
    the PU, RSU and ESU services in the NR-CRN are considered as the third, fourth
    and fifth priority classes respectively. Let denote the priority level assigned
    to a service type, . Accordingly, represents the priority level assignment for
    PU and SU services. In consequence, upon a channel failure, the interrupted PU
    services in the NR-CRN cannot preempt the RSU services in the reserved band, being
    of lower priority than the RSUs in the R-CRN. (5) Channel Repair: A channel is
    said to be repaired when a failed channel is re-established to its normal conditions
    and ready to serve the users. However, no spectrum handover is performed when
    a failed channel is repaired, as indicated in Fig. 2. 5. Continuous time Markov
    chain modeling We develop an analytical model utilizing a continuous time Markov
    chain with discrete states for the proposed DSA. Let S denote the set of feasible
    states and represents a state of the CTMC model where , and denotes the number
    of in-service PUs, RSUs and ESUs in the NR-CRN, , and denote the number of in-service
    PUs and RSUs in the R-CRN respectively, and denote the number of failed channels
    in the NR-CRN and R-CRN respectively, and denotes the number of ESUs in the retrial
    orbit. It follows that the total number of occupied plus failed channels in the
    NR-CRN and in the R-CRN for a given state , denoted by and respectively, are given
    by and . Furthermore, denote the sum of occupied plus failed channels in the whole
    CRN as , i.e.,  . Thus, the number of vacant channels in state can be computed
    as . Table 2 list the state transition rates associated with the above mentioned
    events under certain conditions. Therein, notations AR and DP indicate an arrival
    and a departure event, respectively. RSU, ESU and PU service in the NR-CRN are
    denoted as , and , respectively. RSU and PU service in the R-CRN are denoted as
    and , respectively. Also, denotes an eight element vector whose th component is
    equal to while the other components are equal to . Therein, all possible transitions
    from a generic state are in accordance with those six events illustrated in the
    proposed DSA scheme in Section 4 on the state space For instance, transitions
    from a generic state are described as follows. Table 2. Transitions form a generic

    at the system and occupies a vacant channel in the NR-CRN, if exist any i.e. if
    . • Transition to . This happens when an arriving PU finds all the channels occupied
    in the NR-CRN with no ESU in service ( ) while at least one channel is occupied
    by an RSU ( ). One of those RSUs is preempted by the PU and the RSU performs handover
    to a vacant channel in the R-CRN ( ), thereby increasing by 1, decreasing by 1
    and increasing by 1. • Transition to . This happens when in the NR-CRN, a channel
    occupied by PU ( ) fails, increasing by 1. While no vacant channel is available
    in the NR-CRN ( ), the interrupted PU accesses a vacant channel in the R-CRN (
    ), thereby decreasing by 1 and increasing by 1. Along the similar lines, the transitions
    and the transition rates are provided in Table 2, which are then used to formulate
    the transition rate matrix . 6. Performance analysis In this section, we consider
    the transient analysis of the CTMC under study followed by the computation of
    performance metrics. The size of the state space of the Markov chain makes a matrix
    exponential technique computationally unfeasible for transient solution. To cope
    with such state spaces, we rely on uniformization technique for the transient
    solution of the Markov chain to assess the performance both fast and accurately
    [30]. 6.1. Transient analysis: Uniformization Let denote the probability of the
    system being in state at time . Using the generator matrix , the dynamic behavior
    of the CTMC can be described by the Kolmogorov differential equation in the matrix
    form given by (1) Then, the transient probability vector, constituted by the transient
    probabilities can be obtained as (2) with being the initial probability vector.
    To obtain the transient solution of a CTMC includes evaluating a system of first
    order linear differential equations or, computation of a matrix exponential series
    directly. However, due to the high computational cost, the direct computation
    of the matrix exponential is not regarded as a practical method for solving dependability
    models at the transient phase [31]. Alternatively, this paper resort to the uniformization
    method because of its higher accuracy and efficient computation. Uniformization
    technique includes iteration of the one-step transition matrix of the equivalent
    discrete-time Markov chain to evaluate the performance measures for CTMC [32].
    More specifically, this approach utilizes the transition probability matrix of
    the uniformized Markov chain obtained by , where is referred to as the uniformization
    rate, and denotes the diagonal elements of . Using this, the probability vector
    is evaluated as (3) by truncating the summation at level with the error formula
    (4) 6.2. Transient performance metrics The validity of any CTMC model can be best
    deciphered in terms of its performance metrics. When investigating specific QoS
    measures, dependability theory provides a more systematic methodology for performance
    analysis [33]. To validate the efficiency of the system, we derive mathematical
    expressions of relevant transient performance metrics: A. Capacity The capacity
    of a service in a CRN is defined as the rate of service completions. That is,
    the average number of service completions per unit time. We let , , and be the
    capacity of PU, RSU and ESU services respectively, at time . Then (5) (6) (7)
    B. Channel Availability In a CRN, once all the channels are occupied at an arrival
    instant, a newly arrived user is blocked and the CRN is said to be unavailable
    for new user requests. Therefore, channel availability based performance measurements
    are important for both PU and SU services while performing channel access in a
    CRN [34]. The transient channel availability for PU or SU services is defined
    as the probability of allocating a channel to a new PU or SU arrival without being
    blocked at time . A newly arrived PU service is blocked when all the operational
    channels in the NR-CRN are occupied by PUs. On the other hand, a new SU service
    is blocked in the case where all the operational channels in the NR-CRN are occupied
    by PUs or/and SUs. Let and be the channel availability of PU and SU services at
    time , respectively. We obtain (8) (9) Accordingly, the blocking probabilities
    of both PU and SU services at time , denoted as and respectively, are expressed
    (10) (11) C. Retainability The retainability of a service at time , , defines
    the probability that a connection, once established, will operate within the specified
    transmission quality without any interruption [11]. Thus, mathematically, it can
    be expressed as (12) where is the forced termination probability of that service
    at time . The forced termination probability refers to the probability that an
    ongoing service is forced to terminate before the completion of its communication
    [35]. Note that an ongoing SU service may get terminated owing to a channel failure
    or upon a PU arrival, when no other channel is available in the CRN. The transient
    forced termination probability of RSUs, , can be expressed as the ratio of mean
    forced termination rate of RSUs at time to the mean admitted RSU rate at time
    , . Correspondingly, the forced termination probability of RSUs at time is given
    by (13) where and denote the forced termination rate of SUs at time because of
    PU arrivals and channel failures, respectively. Then we have (14) (15) Likewise,
    the transient forced termination probability of ESUs, , refers to the probability
    of termination of an ongoing ESU service due to a channel failure or a PU arrival,
    when no other channel is available in the NR-CRN and the interrupted service leaves
    the system with probability . It is obtained as (16) where , and and , respectively
    are computed as (17) (18) where (19) (20) Along the similar lines, the transient
    forced termination probability of PUs due to channel failures, , can be calculated
    as (21) where and are given by (22) and , respectively. D. Network Unserviceable
    Probability (NUP) To evaluate the overall satisfaction of the network from a user’s
    point of view, NUP is an important metric to be determined. According to [36],
    the service can be accomplished only if the network provides a connection when
    and as long as required. More specifically, for successful completion of a service,
    the service should neither be blocked upon its arrival nor be terminated before
    its completion. Accordingly, the transient NUP of a service, , is defined as the
    probability that a service cannot be completed successfully at time . It is calculated
    as the ratio between the rate of service completions and the rate of arrivals
    at time . Therefore, the transient NUP for RSU services, , is given by (23) Similarly,
    the NUP for ESU and PU services at time , denoted as and , respectively, is given
    by (24) (25) E. Mean Orbit Size The expected number of users in the retrial orbit
    at time , is obtained as (26) F. Loss Rate due to Impatience Using the concept
    of [37], and [38], we can obtain the average balking rate , the average reneging
    rate and the average rate of user loss because of impatient behavior as follows:
    (27) (28) (29) 7. Numerical results and discussion This section presents the numerical
    results to access our previous analysis. It is worth mentioning that the computation
    of transient probabilities by the suggested uniformization method will portray
    more realistic scenario of concerned CTMC model for which closed form analytical
    results are not possible to derive. The numerical results are obtained by developing
    code in MATLAB to validate the applicability and tractability of the proposed
    computational approach in the CTMC model under study. The values of the network
    configuration are listed in Table 3 unless otherwise stated and . In the figures,
    we derive the main performance measures as a function of the time elapsed since
    the origin. Note that the curves representing No Channel Reservation are obtained
    by configuring the number of channels allocated to R-CRN, . In view of the fact
    that channel failures do not occur frequently, it is required to target a low
    failure rate in contrast with the arrival rates of PUs and SUs. The channel failure
    rate is taken as 0.05 failure per unit time i.e.  by default for the results illustrated
    here. For instance with the PU arrival rate as flows per time unit, on average
    a channel failure occurs every PU arrivals, which is a reasonable configuration
    [28]. On the other hand, once channel failure occurs, in order to maintain a sufficiently
    high level of satisfaction the channel should be repaired at a much higher rate.
    Thus, a repair rate of per unit time is taken for our numerical experiment. A.

    the capacity of RSU and PU services as a function of time respectively, under
    different values of and . From Fig. 5, for all scenarios, we notice that the capacity
    of RSU initially increases with time, but eventually decreases and shows a steady
    behavior. As is to be expected, with a higher channel failure rate, the capacity
    loss increases because of the lack of idle channels and the effect is noticeable
    for reasonably larger values of . Furthermore, it is observed that enabling channel
    reservation degrades the service capacity. However, the situation changes for
    larger values of and with a higher . With smaller values of and lower , an RSU
    service is less likely to be interrupted and accordingly, a large portion of the
    reserved spectrum remains underutilized. This results in degradation in the service
    capacity as compared with the case of no channel reservation. On the other hand,
    with larger , as time grows, channels are more likely to fail and some of the
    interrupted services are provided channel access opportunities in the reserved
    band until completion. Consequently, the channel reservation scheme shows better
    performance compared with the CRN without channel reservation in terms of RSU
    capacity, however, the effect does not agree for smaller values of . Therefore,
    this result indicates a need for investigation of the network conditions which
    needs channel reservation as well as the conditions under which the channel reservation
    is not required. Download : Download high-res image (364KB) Download : Download

    As shown in those curves, with a larger value of , the capacity of PUs first increases,
    and then, it shows a steady behavior. Again, we observed that with higher channel
    failure rate, the PU capacity decreases due to the lack of idle channels. Furthermore,
    the PU capacity decreases due to channel reservation and the degree of degradation
    is proportional to the number of reserved channels. This is because, when channel
    reservation is not employed, all channels would be available for new services
    and further with higher values of , the number of channels available for new services
    diminish, resulting in capacity reduction. However, the PU capacity loss is less
    than for an RSU retainability gain of when . It follows that PUs’ performance
    degradation is not that significant in comparison with the RSU retainability gain
    achieved when channel reservation is employed. B. Retainability Download : Download

    of RSU services as a function of time when channel reservation is applied. Let
    us now observe the achieved retainability by SU and PU services as the time varies,
    plotted in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9. As expected, these figures confirm that the
    achieved retainability level for each service decreases with time due to more
    active users in the system and then attains the steady-state. As observed in Fig.
    7, the retainability of RSU services can be increased significantly, compared
    with a CRN without channel reservation. To further achieve higher retainability,
    it is required to reserve more number of channels in the R-CRN. With a higher
    number of channels reserved, an ongoing session in the NR-CRN when interrupted
    due to PU arrivals or channel failures, is allowed to access more channels, resulting
    in an improved retainability level. In Fig. 8, we investigate the retainability
    level of PU and both SU services with respect to channel failure rates. As can
    be observed in this figure, higher channel failure rates lead to a decreased retainability
    level as expected. With further analysis of the obtained results, we also note
    that the degradation in retainability level is more prominent for RSU services.
    Also, it is worth mentioning that the retainability level of PU services is always
    higher than that of SU services and the RSU services outperform the ESU services
    owing to channel access priority privileges. Furthermore, the achievable retainability
    level for ESU services is reported in Fig. 9 considering different retrial probabilities.
    As shown in the figure, the retainability level of ESUs get significantly improve
    using the proposed retrial policy in contrast with the strategy without any retrial
    transmission. When using retry policy, the interrupted users due to PU arrivals
    or channel failures, instead of being terminated are allowed to queue into the
    orbit for later retrial transmission. This results in higher service retainability.
    Moreover, the larger the retrial probability is, the lesser likely is the interrupted
    ESU to be terminated forcibly and thus significantly improves the retainability
    level further. Download : Download high-res image (374KB) Download : Download

    point of view, we observe that the system achieves significantly improved performance
    with reserved channels. However, the price the system pays for channel reservation
    is the reduced capacity as well as the decreased channel availability. Since service
    interruptions lasting over long periods is not desirable, thus to maintain a higher
    level of service retainability is considered as more fundamental. Thus, reservation
    of channels is recommended up to a certain extent although the channel availability
    of new users decreases as depicted in Fig. 10, Fig. 11. As time grows, the channel
    availability of PUs and RSUs decreases due to the commencement of more users in
    the system. It is clear from these figures that the channel availability of PU
    and RSU services get decreased because of both channel failures as well as channel
    reservations. In the case of no channel reservation, all channels would be available
    for new users and therefore the scheme with no channel reserved always results
    in the highest channel availability. Moreover, when a fewer number of channels
    is reserved i.e at smaller values of , more channel access opportunities are given
    to the new users and consequently, the channel availability becomes higher. These
    figures further illustrate that the PUs’ channel availability is higher than that
    of the RSUs due to its priority on accessing the channels. In conclusion, this
    result reveals a need for an assessment of the trade-off between the ongoing services’
    retainability and the new users’ channel availability. Download : Download high-res

    When evaluating the NUP, the effects of both channel availability and service
    retainability are considered. Thus, deriving and plotting such metric helps us
    assessing the overall performance of the proposed scheme. In Fig. 12, Fig. 13,
    we evaluate the NUP of RSU and ESU services respectively considering different
    configurations. As expected, NUP of both services first increases with an increase
    in time and then shows the steady-state behavior, however, the curve for ESUs
    converges to the steady-state NUP at comparatively larger . The results in these
    figures confirm that NUP increases with a higher channel failure rate. On the
    other hand, with a higher channel repair rate, the NUP improves to some extent.
    This is because, with higher , the failed channels are repaired shortly and become
    idle again, leading to increased channel opportunities for users. However, as
    can be observed, for smaller values of , the increase of repair rate may not help
    to improve the NUP. E. Mean Orbit Size Fig. 14, Fig. 15 depict the expected size
    of the orbit as a function of time under various configurations. We notice that
    as time passes the mean orbit size increases as it should be. Fig. 14 confirms
    that since employing the access retrial to ESUs ( ), allow the would be terminated
    users to join the orbit, therefore, with higher retrial probability, a greater
    number of interrupted ESUs join the orbit for later transmission and consequently
    increases the mean orbit size. Also, it is observed that smaller the balking probability
    ( ) is, an arriving ESU is routed to enter the orbit with a bigger probability
    ( ), resulting in larger orbit size, which agrees with our expectations. Furthermore,
    Fig. 15 illustrates that the mean orbit size is significantly influenced by the
    channel failure rate. With higher , an ongoing session of ESU service is more
    likely to be interrupted and accordingly employing the retrial policy leads to
    a bigger orbit size. On the other hand, with a higher retrial rate, the size of
    the orbit decreases. However, under certain time values, the situation changes
    for higher values of . With a larger , the number of idle channels in the network
    diminishes. Thus, as the retrial rate increases, a greater number of blocked ESUs
    rejoin the orbit due to retrial congestions and consequently the mean orbit size
    increases. This indicates that the mean orbit size is sensitive to the value of
    as well as . F. Loss Rate due to Impatience Finally, in Fig. 16 the average loss
    rate of ESU services due to impatience at different time points is plotted. We
    observe that the loss rate increases gradually and then attains the steady-state
    with the passage of time. Further, as shown in the figure, diminishing the PU
    service duration, frees up its channels faster, enabling less balking and reneging
    of ESUs. This leads to an improvement in ESUs’ performance in terms of their loss
    rate. On the other hand, with a higher retrial rate, a greater number of ESUs
    are blocked due to retrial congestion, thereby increases the loss rate. Consequently,
    in brief, these results enable a trade-off between the PU service rate and the
    retrial rate that can be tuned according to the QoS requirements of the secondary
    traffic. 8. Conclusions The transient analysis of CRNs from the perspective of
    dependability theory remains largely uncharted despite extensive research efforts
    in the past decade. In this paper, a dynamic spectrum access scheme with channel
    reservation and retrial policy is proposed which enhances the heterogeneous SUs’
    performance in CRNs prone to random channel failures, in terms of service retainability
    and network unserviceable probability. The mathematical expressions of transient
    performance metrics for channel access in CRNs are derived utilizing the uniformization
    tool. Through CTMC modeling, the performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated.
    The obtained numerical results have revealed that the channel reservation not
    always provide reasonable performance trade-offs as most works suggested, contrarily,
    its success highly depends on the network’s state. Although channel reservation
    may not be required at very small time points and at very low channel failure
    rates, but the proposed reservation scheme is recommended for QoS provisioning.
    In addition, the channel failure rate and recovery rate also have a significant
    influence on the availability and reliability provided to end-users. Furthermore,
    results have also shown that employing the retrial phenomenon subject to balking
    and reneging significantly influences the performance of CRNs by improving SU
    performance. We believe that the scheme presented in this paper provides a systematic
    approach for time-dependent reliability analysis of channel access in multichannel
    CRNs. CRediT authorship contribution statement Shruti: Conceptualization, Methodology,

    In the past few decades there has been a rapid growth in communication networks
    and services. With this boom there has been emergence of the issue of network
    congestions and in its response, the arrival of several new solutions in the form
    of either innovative concepts or technologies. One such technology is that of
    Software Defined Radios (SDRs) that emulate specialized communication hardware
    and functions (such as mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors,
    etc.) on a single hardware platform using software. A variant of such Software
    Defined Radio networks are the Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) which are used
    in spread spectrum communication. Possible functions of cognitive radio include
    the ability of a transceiver to determine its geographic location, identify and
    authorize its user, encrypt or decrypt signals, sense neighboring wireless devices
    in operation, and adjust output power and modulation characteristics. These networks
    with their advanced capabilities of sensing and cognition have been proposed as
    a solution to be able to use the spectrum efficiently and release the pressure
    on the network. Several models have been proposed to implement CRNs such as Dynamic
    Exclusive Usage Model, Hierarchical Access Model, Open Sharing Model. Among these
    the Dynamic Exclusive Usage Model (“Dynamic Licensing”) is of interest to us.
    The Primary User (PU) has exclusive rights over the spectrum, which it might use
    as and when required. Sometimes this spectrum is underutilized. To improve the
    efficiency of Spectrum utilization, the primary user is assumed to be aware about
    the existence of secondary users and will share its underutilized radio resources
    (Spectrum, time slots, etc.) with the secondary users in order to obtain some
    remuneration (e.g. Improved performance [1,2,3,4,5,6], economic rewards [7,8,9,10],
    etc.). Basically, the Dynamic Exclusive Usage Model may be broadly divided into
    two types of models: 1. Interference-Based Model. 2. Interference-Free Model.
    Here, we use interference free model in System model-I [11] and introduce an interference
    term in System model-II. 2 System Model Here, we consider the above Fig. 1a, b
    system model [11], where a single PU-pair (with a PU Tx and PU Rx) shares its
    licensed spectrum (time slots) with an infrastructure-based secondary network
    serving a set of SUs (denoted by the set S = {1, 2, …, n}). The PU time slot is
    denoted by T. There is a fluctuation of the channel power gains for the PU and
    the SUs. Assuming, that there are C-possible states associated with the entire
    system, with the c-th state denoted by the vector \\(\\left\\{ {g_{0}^{c} ,g_{1}^{c}
    ,g_{2}^{c} , \\ldots ,g_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}\\). Here, \\(g_{0}^{c}\\) denotes
    the channel gain between the PU transmitter (PU Tx) and PU receiver (PU Rx) under
    channel state c and \\(g_{s}^{c}\\), for all s = 1, 2, …, n denotes the channel
    gain from the CR base station to SU s under channel state c. The probability of
    occurrence of channel state c is denoted by Prc. Fig. 1 a System model-I {one
    PU with Tx and Rx pair shares it’s underutilized time slots with three SUs using
    an infrastructure CR base station}, b PU time frame {total frame length = T; time
    required for PU transmission = xc; time shared with SUs = T − xc}, c system model-II
    {consisting of two primary user channels and n-secondary users who are served
    on first come, first serve basis} Full size image Further in System model-II,
    we utilize the results obtained from System model-I [11], to design an LCC (Lost
    Call Cleared) or m/m/queue system, where the n-SUs are assigned channel 1 or channel
    2, corresponding to PU1 and PU2 respectively. The channel allocation is based
    on the availability of the time slots required by each secondary user with one/both
    of the PU time frames and a profit function computation, the details of which
    is provided in the subsequent sections. 3 Problem Formulation The PU shares its
    time slots with the secondary users under each channel state c. Under each channel
    state c, the PU uses only a part of its slot denoted by xc. The remaining T −
    xc, part is shared with the SUs. Let \\(t_{s}^{c}\\) denote the time shared by
    the SU s under the channel state c and let \\(p_{s}^{c}\\) denote the power allocation
    to SU s under the channel state c. Hence, the SU’s utility can be expressed in
    terms of it’s average throughput as follows [11]: $$U_{s} \\left( {t_{s}^{c} ,p_{s}^{c}
    } \\right)_{\\forall c} = \\sum\\limits_{c}^{{}} {Pr^{c} t_{s}^{c} } \\log_{2}
    \\left( {1 + k\\frac{{p_{s}^{c} g_{s}^{c} }}{n}} \\right),$$ (1) where, n = noise
    power of background noise Let ds = payment of SU s. Then the net reward to the
    SU s is given by [11]: $$R_{s} \\left( {t_{s}^{c} ,p_{s}^{c} ,d_{s} } \\right)_{\\forall
    c} = U_{s} \\left( {t_{s}^{c} ,p_{s}^{c} } \\right)_{\\forall c} - d_{s} ,\\quad
    \\forall s$$ (2) If, V : primary user volume, to be delivered in the time slot
    T x c : transmit time for the PU under channel state c L : additional energy cost
    to the PU, when sharing its spectrum with SU under channel state c \\(\\delta\\)
    : PU’s marginal cost for it’s energy consumption. Then the interaction b/w the
    PU and the SUs can be modeled as a Nash Bargaining problem as follows [11]: $${\\text{NBP}}
    = \\hbox{max} \\left( {v - \\delta L(x^{c} )_{\\forall c} -\\Psi _{0} } \\right)^{{\\mu_{0}
    }} \\prod\\limits_{s \\in S} {\\left( {U_{s} \\left( {t_{s}^{c} ,p_{s}^{c} } \\right)_{\\forall

    $$x^{c} + \\sum\\limits_{s \\in S}^{{}} {t_{s}^{c} } \\le T,\\quad \\forall c$$
    (4) $$T^{\\hbox{min} } \\le x^{c} \\le T^{\\hbox{max} } ,\\quad \\forall c$$ (5)

    power of the SU s However, the difficulty that arises in the NBP objective function
    is its non-convexity, leading to no efficient algorithms to solve it. Hence, [11]
    identifies a property of the NBP, that correlates it with a social optimization
    problem, providing maximum possible profit for all the parties involved in the
    problem based on the property [11] proposes a two-step algorithm to solve the
    SOP problem. The two-step procedure in [11] addresses the following key points:
    1. How the PU should share its time slots with the SUs and charge them for the
    same? 2. How the SUs share the allocated time slot from the PU among themselves
    efficiently and also what their preferred payment scheme is? We then further use
    the above two-step algorithm [11] along with a cost function related to the maximization
    of the capacity/throughput of the SUs upon their assignment to any of the two
    PUs shown in the modified system model Fig. 2c to obtain an optimal PU channel
    assignment policy for the SUs. The model addresses the need to figure out an optimal
    channel allocation policy in a multi PU-SU environment. System model II consists
    of two PUs and n-SUs, who are served on first come first serve basis (LCC system)
    maximizing the overall gain of the system. Fig. 2 System model-II Full size image
    4 Bargaining Problem Paper [11] sites the relationship between the NBP and an
    associated social optimization problem. They then look at a two-step procedure
    to solve the bargaining problem. They relate the bargaining problem with the social
    optimization problem (M), as follows [11]: $$M = \\hbox{max} \\left\\{ {\\sum\\limits_{s
    \\in S}^{{}} {U_{s} \\left( {t_{s}^{c} ,p_{s}^{c} } \\right)_{\\forall c} } -
    \\delta L\\left( {x^{c} } \\right)_{\\forall c} } \\right\\}$$ (10) M denotes
    the optimal (or maximum) value for the social optimization problem. The SOP is
    however still difficult to solve due to its non-convexity, i.e., the non-convexity
    of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{s \\in S} {U_{s} (t_{s}^{c} ,p_{s}^{c} )_{\\forall c} }\\),
    to be exact. The social optimization problem (M) can still be changed into the
    following problem (Meqv) by changing the variable \\(\\theta_{s}^{c} = p_{s}^{c}
    t_{s}^{c}\\), denoting the allocated energy for the SU s under the channel state
    c, into the social optimization problem, as follows [11]: $$M_{\\text{eqv}} =
    \\hbox{max} \\sum\\limits_{c} {\\left\\{ {\\sum\\limits_{s \\in S} {Pr^{c} t_{s}^{c}
    } \\log_{2} \\left( {1 + k\\frac{{\\theta_{s}^{c} g_{s}^{c} }}{{t_{s}^{c} n}}}
    \\right) - \\delta L(x^{c} )_{\\forall c} } \\right\\}}$$ (11) The above Meqv
    problem is a strictly convex optimization problem and it assumes a set of unique
    optimum solutions [11]. 5 Two-Step Procedure Two-step procedure to solve the NBP
    [11]: Step 1: First, Mp is solved and the optimal values of resource allocations
    (optimal PU transmit time \\(\\{ x^{c*} \\}_{\\forall c}\\), optimal transmit
    time of each SU s \\(\\{ t_{s}^{c*} \\}_{\\forall s,c}\\) and its transmit power
    \\(\\{ p_{s}^{c*} \\}_{\\forall s,c}\\)) are obtained. Step 2: By putting these
    optimal resource allocations into the NBP, we get the optimal PU’s charge (\\(v^{*}\\))
    and SU’s payment \\((\\{ d_{s}^{*} \\}_{\\forall s} )\\). 6 Algorithm 1 to Solve
    Step-1 Algorithm 1 tries to address the above optimality condition, by performing
    finite number of iterations to find the PU’s optimal transmit time \\(\\{ x^{c*}
    \\}_{\\forall c}\\) [11], Steps: 1. Set, the upper bound for \\(\\Omega\\) as
    \\(\\overline{\\Omega } = \\frac{{T - T^{\\hbox{min} } }}{{T - T^{\\hbox{min}
    } \\sum\\nolimits_{c} {Pr^{c} \\frac{n}{{G^{c} }} + E_{\\text{avg}} } }}\\). 2.
    Set, the lower bound for \\(\\Omega\\) as \\(\\underline{\\Omega } = \\frac{{T
    - T^{\\hbox{max} } }}{{T - T^{\\hbox{max} } \\sum\\nolimits_{c} {Pr^{c} \\frac{n}{{G^{c}
    }} + E_{\\text{avg}} } }}.\\) 3. Compute, \\(\\Omega = \\frac{1}{2}(\\overline{\\Omega
    } + \\underline{\\Omega } ).\\) 4. Compute, {xc*}∀c under each channel state c
    using $$x^{c} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {T^{\\hbox{min} } ,} \\hfill
    & {K_{L}^{c} (\\Omega ) \\le K_{R}^{c} (T^{\\hbox{min} } )} \\hfill \\\\ {\\frac{V\\;\\ln
    2}{{1 + W\\left[ { - \\frac{1}{e}\\left\\{ {K_{L}^{c} (\\Omega )\\frac{{g_{0}^{c}
    }}{\\delta n} + 1} \\right\\}} \\right]}},} \\hfill & {K_{R}^{c} (T^{\\hbox{min}
    } ) < K_{L}^{c} (\\Omega ) < K_{R}^{c} (T)} \\hfill \\\\ {T^{\\hbox{max} } ,}
    \\hfill & {K_{L}^{c} (\\Omega ) \\ge K_{R}^{c} (T^{\\hbox{max} } )} \\hfill \\\\
    \\end{array} } \\right..$$ 5. Compute, \\(C = \\sum\\nolimits_{c} {(Pr^{c} (T
    - x^{c} ))}\\) and \\(D = \\sum\\nolimits_{c} {\\left\\{ {Pr^{c} \\frac{n}{{G^{c}
    }}\\left( {T - x^{c} } \\right)} \\right\\}}\\) using the calculated \\(x^{c}\\).
    6. Calculate, \\(\\Delta = C -\\Omega \\;(E_{\\text{avg}} + D)\\), using C and
    D. 7. Check for the convergence condition, \\(\\left|\\Delta \\right| \\le {\\text{tol}}\\),
    where tol = tolerance error for convergence. 8. If \\(\\left|\\Delta \\right|
    \\le {\\text{tol}}\\), then the algorithm converges, and we output the set of
    {\\(x^{c}\\)}, as the optimal set of {\\(x^{c}\\)}. Else, we go to step 9. 9.
    If, \\(\\Delta \\rangle {\\text{tol}}\\) we update the lower bound as \\(\\underline{\\Omega
    } =\\Omega\\). Else, if \\(\\Delta \\le {-}{\\text{tol}}\\), we update upper bound
    as \\(\\underline{\\Omega } =\\Omega\\). 10. Go, back to step 3. Here, $$K_{L}^{c}
    (\\Omega ) = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}\\left\\{ {1 + \\ln \\left( {\\Omega \\frac{n}{{G^{c}
    }}} \\right) -\\Omega \\frac{n}{{G^{c} }}} \\right\\}$$ And, $$K_{R}^{c} (T^{\\hbox{min}
    } ) = \\delta \\left\\{ {2^{{\\frac{V}{{x^{c} }}}} \\left( {1 - \\frac{V}{{x^{c}
    }}\\ln 2} \\right) - 1} \\right\\}\\frac{n}{{g_{0}^{c} }}$$ Now, the unique value
    of xc for each value of c and \\(\\Omega\\) as is given by [11]: $$x^{c} = \\frac{{V\\;\\text{ln
    }2}}{{1 + W\\left[ { - \\frac{1}{e}\\left\\{ {\\text{K}_{L}^{c} (\\Omega )\\frac{{g_{0}^{c}
    }}{\\delta n} + 1} \\right\\}} \\right]}},$$ where, W(.) is the Lambert W-function.
    Hence, Algorithm 1 is used by the PU to determine it’s optimal transmit time {xc*}
    under all channel states. After knowing {xc*}∀c each of the SUs s can calculate
    its optimal utility \\(U_{s}^{*} = U(t_{s}^{c*} ,p_{s}^{c*} )_{\\forall c}\\)
    and the PU can calculate its energy consumption cost \\(L^{*} = L(x^{c*} )_{\\forall
    c}\\).Then, the optimal value for the social optimization can be obtained. 7 Algorithm
    A2 to Solve Step-2 Algorithm 2 is used to find the PU’s charge and each SU’s payments
    [11] Knowing \\(\\{ {U}_{c}^{*} \\}_{\\forall c}\\) and \\(\\delta L_{{}}^{*}\\)
    from the social optimization problem, the objective NBP problem can be written
    as the following, Charge Payment Problem (Cp) [11]: $$C_{p}{:}\\;\\mathop {\\hbox{max}
    }\\limits_{{v,\\{ d_{s} \\} }} \\left( {v - \\delta L -\\Psi_{0} } \\right)^{{\\mu_{0}
    }} \\prod\\limits_{s \\in S} {\\left( {U_{s}^{*} - d_{s} -\\Psi_{s} } \\right)^{{\\mu_{s}
    }} }$$ Since, \\(\\{ {U}_{c}^{*} \\}_{\\forall c}\\) and \\(\\delta L\\) are known,
    therefore, the above problem can be re-written in the log form, called Cp − E
    (Cp-Equivalent) problem as follows [11]: $$C_{p} - E = \\mathop {\\hbox{max} }\\limits_{{v,\\{
    d_{s} \\} }} \\mu_{0} \\ln \\left( {v - \\delta L -\\Psi _{0} } \\right) + \\sum\\limits_{s
    \\in S} {\\mu_{s} } \\ln \\left( {U_{s}^{*} - d_{s} -\\Psi _{s} } \\right)$$ Steps:
    1. Set, upper bound for \\(\\chi\\) as \\(\\bar{\\chi } = \\frac{{\\hbox{min}
    \\left( {{ \\hbox{min} }_{s \\in S} \\left\\{ {\\frac{{H_{T}^{*} }}{{\\mu_{s}
    }}} \\right\\},\\frac{{H_{T}^{*} }}{{\\mu_{0} }}} \\right)}}{\\text{tol}}\\).
    2. Set, lower bound of \\(\\chi\\) as \\(\\chi = 0\\). 3. The PU sets, \\(\\chi
    = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( {\\overline{\\chi } + \\underline{\\chi } } \\right)\\).
    4. The PU evaluates the expected charge \\(v = \\mu_{0} \\chi + \\alpha L_{{}}^{*}
    +\\Psi _{0}\\). 5. The PU broadcasts the signaling \\(\\chi\\) to all the SUs.
    6. On receiving \\(\\chi\\), each SU calculates its preferred payment \\(d_{s}
    = U_{s}^{*} -\\Psi _{s} - \\mu_{s} \\chi\\), and relays it to the PU. 7. After
    receiving all the ds values from the SUs, the PU compares the aggregate preferred
    payment with its expected charge v. 8. If \\(v > \\sum\\nolimits_{s} {d_{s} }
    + {\\text{tol}}\\), then set upper bound, \\(\\overline{\\chi } = \\chi\\). Go
    back to step 3. 9. Else if, \\(v < \\sum\\nolimits_{s} {d_{s} } + {\\text{tol}}\\),
    then set upper bound, \\(\\underline{\\chi } = \\chi\\). Go back to step 3. 10.
    Else, \\(v = \\sum\\nolimits_{s} {d_{s} } + {\\text{tol}}\\) and the algorithm
    converges. In this case output the current values of v and {ds} as the optimal
    solution of Cp − E. Here, \\(H_{T}^{*} = M^{*} - \\sum\\nolimits_{s}^{{}} {\\Psi
    _{s} -\\Psi _{0} }\\) [11], represents the net benefit above target levels that
    the PU and the Sus get from participation in this mutual cooperation. 8 Algorithm
    A3 to Obtain Optimal SU Allocation with Two PU System Here, we consider the system
    model of Fig. 2c. Here, we assume an LCC system with n-SUs coming up to the CR
    Base Station on a random and sequential basis. Each SU attempt to access the PU
    network is assumed to be a fresh attempt and independent of any previous attempts
    or SU allocations. The simplified model consists of two primary channels, each
    having its own associated profit/cost of access. A SU arriving at any instant
    of time is allocated to one of the two available PU channels based on time slot
    availability and a cost function value, which is computed using the former two
    algorithms Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. The parameters to be considered while
    computing the cost function value as: $$\\left\\{ {t_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall
    s,c} ,T_{p} ,\\left\\{ {g_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c} ,\\left\\{ {p_{s}^{c}
    } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c} ,B_{p} ,\\left\\{ {I_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall
    s,c} ,$$ where, \\(\\left\\{ {t_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c}\\) : Optimal
    SU transmit time obtained from Algorithm \\(T_{p}\\) : Total time slot for PUp.
    \\(\\left\\{ {g_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c}\\) : Information channel gain
    of SU s under channel state c. \\(\\left\\{ {p_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall
    s,c}\\) : Power allocation for SU s under channel state c. \\(B_{p}\\) : Bandwidth
    of the PU channel p \\(\\left\\{ {{\\text{I}}_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c}\\)
    : Interference channel gain of SU s under channel state c Using capacity theory,
    to maximize the profit to the SU in terms of improved transmission capacity/throughput,
    the profit function for the SU s can be represented as follows: $${\\text{Pft}}_{p}
    = \\frac{{t_{s}^{c} }}{{T_{p} }}B_{p} \\log_{2} \\left( {1 + \\frac{{g_{s}^{c}
    p_{s}^{c} }}{{I_{s}^{c} }}} \\right)$$ (12) Here, \\({\\text{Pft}}_{p}\\) represents
    the effective capacity of each channel, which varies for each PU and is a function
    of the decision variables \\(\\left\\{ {t_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c}
    ,T_{p} ,\\left\\{ {g_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c} ,\\left\\{ {p_{s}^{c}
    } \\right\\}_{\\forall s,c} ,B_{p} ,\\left\\{ {I_{s}^{c} } \\right\\}_{\\forall
    s,c}\\) Steps: 1. Initialize the optimal PU transmit times for PU1 and PU2 as,
    \\(x_{1}^{c}\\) for PU1 and \\(x_{2}^{c}\\) for PU2 respectively using the current
    CSI. 2. Obtain the time slots left in the frames corresponding to PU1 and PU2
    as: T1 − \\(x_{1}^{c}\\) and T2 − \\(x_{2}^{c}\\), respectively. 3. Obtain \\(t_{s}^{c}\\)
    for the SU s arriving at the given instant for the current CSI using algorithm
    1. 4. If \\(t_{s}^{c} > \\left( {T_{1} - x_{1}^{c} } \\right){\\text{ and }}\\left(
    {T_{2} - x_{2}^{c} } \\right)\\), then block the SU and go back to step 1. 5.
    If \\(t_{s}^{c} > (T_{1} - x_{1}^{c} ){\\text{ and }}t_{s}^{c} \\le (T_{2} - x_{2}^{c}
    )\\), assign SU s to PU2 and exit. 6. If \\(t_{s}^{c} \\le \\left( {T_{1} - x_{1}^{c}
    } \\right){\\text{ and }}t_{s}^{c} > \\left( {T_{2} - x_{2}^{c} } \\right)\\),
    assign SU s to PU1 and exit. 7. If \\(t_{s}^{c} \\le (T_{1} - x_{1}^{c} ){\\text{
    and }}(T_{2} - x_{2}^{c} )\\), calculate \\({\\text{Pft}}_{1}\\), \\({\\text{Pft}}_{2}\\)
    corresponding to PU1 and PU2 and go to step 8. 8. If \\({\\text{Pft}}_{1} > {\\text{Pft}}_{2}\\),
    assign SU s to PU1 and exit. 9. If \\({\\text{Pft}}_{1} < {\\text{Pft}}_{2}\\),
    assign SU s to PU2 and exit. 10. If \\({\\text{Pft}}_{1} = {\\text{Pft}}_{2}\\),
    assign SU s to PU1 or PU2 randomly and exit. The algorithm is repetitive and assigns
    a SU to PU1 or PU2 at every instant a SU arrives to use the PU network. 9 Generalized
    Model for Algorithm A3 The above algorithm may be extended for m-PU, n-SU, LCC,
    CRN networks, as is quite intuitive. Steps: 1. Initialize the optimal PU transmit
    times for PU1, PU2, PU3, …, PUn as, \\(x_{1}^{c}\\) for PU1, \\(x_{2}^{c}\\) for
    PU2, …, \\(x_{n}^{c}\\) for PUn respectively using the current CSI. 2. Obtain
    the time slots left in the frames corresponding to PU1, PU2, …, PUn as: T1 − \\(x_{1}^{c}\\),
    T2 − \\(x_{2}^{c}\\), …, Tn − \\(x_{n}^{c}\\) respectively. 3. Obtain \\(t_{s}^{c}\\)
    for the SU s arriving at the given instant for the current CSI using algorithm
    1. 4. If \\(t_{s}^{c} > (T_{i} - x_{{}}^{c} )_{\\forall i} ,i = 1,2, \\ldots ,n\\),
    then block the SU and go back to step 1. 5. If \\(t_{i}^{c} > (T_{i} - x_{i}^{c}
    )_{\\forall i \\ne j} {\\text{ and }}t_{s}^{c} \\le (T_{j} - x_{j}^{c} )\\), assign
    SU s to PUj and exit. 6. If \\(t_{s}^{c} \\le (T_{i} - x_{i}^{c} )\\), for more
    than one i, calculate \\(\\{ {\\text{Pft}}_{i} \\}\\), corresponding to the set
    of i PUs and go to step 7. 7. If \\({\\text{Pft}}_{i} > {\\text{Pft}}_{j} ,\\forall
    j,j \\ne i\\), assign SU s to PUi and exit. 8. If \\({\\text{Pft}}_{i} = {\\text{Pft}}_{j}
    ,\\forall i,j,i \\ne j\\), assign SU s to one of {PUi} randomly and exit. 10 Results
    and Discussion Assuming, each channel to be slow-fading and having a Normal distribution
    of probability of occurrence. Let the state of a channel be modeled by the following
    states, with the associated relative gains (w.r.t mild/normal state) of each state
    assumed to be fixed as follows (Table 1). Table 1 Channel states with associated
    relative gains Full size table These, states are assumed to be the result of channel
    scattering effects and slow-fading effect with weather conditions of the channel.
    Assuming the original, system model that we assumed in Fig. 1a, where we have
    one single PU and 3 SUs, we have (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 LCC CRN system consisting of
    n-SUs and two PUs Full size image Here, we have considered the assumptions and
    model parameters from the results of System model-I [11]. Apart from that, we
    have considered two PUs and n-SUs forming an LCC system. The SUs are served on
    a first come first serve basis and any dropped attempt is cleared from the system.
    We have used a Poisson distribution to model the secondary transmit times requested
    by the SUs. $${\\text{i}} . {\\text{e}} .,P(k) = e^{ - \\lambda } \\frac{{\\lambda^{k}
    }}{k!},\\quad k = 0,1,2, \\ldots ,$$ where, \\(\\lambda\\) = average call holding
    time, P(k) represents the probability of k units of secondary transmit time requested
    by the SU s with a mean secondary time duration of \\(\\lambda\\) (Fig. 4). Fig.
    4 Channel assignment for system model-II Full size image The above plot assumes
    identical PU bandwidth, power and interference conditions. Only the instantaneous
    CSI and the corresponding calculations for Pft1 and Pft2 based on algorithm 3,
    for channel 1 and channel 2, corresponding to PU1 and PU2 varies. Here, \\(\\lambda\\) = 50
    and we find that 55 out of 100 calls are assigned to channel 2 and 44 to channel
    1 with a GOS of 0.01 (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Profit calculation for both the channels
    and corresponding channel assignment for system model-II Full size image 10.1
    Profit Values and Channel Assignment The adjoined plot assumes identical PU bandwidth,
    power and interference conditions. Only the instantaneous CSI and the corresponding
    calculations for Pft1 and Pft2 based on algorithm 3, for channel 1 and channel
    2, corresponding to PU1 and PU2 varies. The upper figure shows variations in Pft1
    and Pft2 with channel states and the lower figure the corresponding channel assignments.
    At any instant of time a SU s is assigned to either channel 1 or channel 2 depending
    on the relative values of Pft1 and Pft2. The above run shows a GOS/Blocking probability
    of 0. 10.2 Transmission Power and Channel Assignment Figure 6 on the right shows
    a clear preference for channel 2 over channel 1, when the power allocated for
    transmission over channel 2 is much greater than that for channel 1. Here, the
    mean SU secondary time is assumed to be 5 units of time. Fig. 6 Channel assignment
    policy when power allocation for channel 2 ≫ power allocation for channel 1 Full
    size image Figure 7 on the left shows a preference for both channel 2 and channel
    1, when the power allocated for transmission over channel 2 is almost equal to
    that for channel 1. Here, the mean SU secondary time is assumed to be 5 units
    of time. Fig. 7 Channel assignment policy when power allocation for channel 2
    = power allocation for channel 1 Full size image Figure 8 shows a clear preference
    for channel 1 over channel 2, when the power allocated for transmission over channel
    1 is much greater than that for channel 2. Here, the mean SU holding time is assumed
    to be 5 units of time. Fig. 8 Channel assignment policy when power allocation
    for channel 2 ≪ power allocation for channel 1 Full size image Figure 9 shows
    a nearly constant value of GOS/Blocking Probability of 0.07 up to a transmission
    power difference of 0.2 beyond which, blocking decreases linearly with the difference
    in transmission power and becomes nearly 0 at around a difference of 0.37. Thus,
    the blocking probability for the proposed system decreases as the difference between
    the transmission powers corresponding to the two channels becomes large. However,
    a very large difference may lead to one channel being preferred heavily over the
    other. Hence, a balanced power allocation above a difference of 0.2 is required.

    Similar, to the last case, here too (Fig. 10), the blocking probability seems
    to decrease as the difference in interference powers between the two channels
    increases beyond 0.2. This shows that the proposed model is quite robust to the
    effects of interference as the GOS improves as the interference difference between
    the two channels increases beyond 0.2, however large the individual values of
    interference powers may be. Fig. 10 GOS/blocking probability versus difference

    of Average GOS with Average Secondary User Transmit Time Figure 11 shows that
    the mean GOS for the system increases for an increase in mean secondary time from
    0 to 10 and then shows a gradual roll-off to zero as the mean secondary time increases
    from 10 to 100.The average GOS over the entire range of lambda from 1 to 100 is
    about 0.0033. Fig. 11 Average GOS versus mean secondary time Full size image 11
    Conclusion In this paper, we attempted to use the developments made in [11], to
    design an LCC system, where the optimal SU assignment is made to the available
    PU channels based on algorithm 3. Algorithm 3 optimizes both the PU transmit times
    and profit, while at the same time maximizing the throughput of the assigned SU.
    In most of the random runs we saw a blocking probability of zero. However, in
    some runs, the probability of blocking went up to as large as 0.07. However, over
    the 200 runs of the algorithm made with varying values of average SU transmit
    times (lambda), the overall average blocking probability is found to about 0.0033,
    which makes the system quite robust. References Zhang, J., Zhang, Q.: Stackelberg

    In alignment with the intent of the literature review, the paper addresses the
    need for improved QoS in cognitive radio networks, which is particularly important
    due to the dynamic nature of the spectrum environment and the diverse quality
    of service requirements of various applications. By employing the ZigBee protocol,
    the paper demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a QoS framework in cognitive
    radio networks.


    The authors argue that ZigBee, with its inherent QoS-enabled parameters, can effectively
    address the challenges associated with QoS provisioning in cognitive radio networks.
    Through simulations, they demonstrate that ZigBee outperforms the wireless LAN
    MAC protocol (Wi-Fi) in terms of throughput, delay, and stability, highlighting
    its suitability for QoS provisioning in cognitive radio environments.


    However, it is important to note that this paper is solely focused on the ZigBee
    protocol and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of other potential solutions
    or approaches for QoS provisioning in cognitive radio networks. A broader examination
    of different techniques and protocols would provide a more thorough understanding
    of the landscape of QoS provisioning in this domain.


    Overall, the paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the potential
    of ZigBee for QoS provisioning in cognitive radio networks. It aligns with the
    review intention by exploring the use of ZigBee as a solution for addressing the
    challenges of QoS provisioning in real-time, automated irrigation systems.'

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    A Cognitive Radio is a dynamically reconfigurable radio that can adapt its operating
    parameters to the surrounding environment, which has been made feasible by recent
    advances such as software-defined radio (SDR) and smart antennas. It is a transceiver
    designed to use the wireless channels in its vicinity. This kind of radio automatically
    detects available channels in wireless spectrum, and then accordingly changes
    its transmission or reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless communications
    in a form of dynamic spectrum management. Employing Cognitive Radio (CR) devices
    brings about improved efficiency in wireless spectrum (radio frequency) utilization
    due to more flexible and agile access. For the past few years experts have given
    quality attention to resolving the friction existing between licensed users (primary
    users) and the unlicensed ones (cognitive users). The concern has been to bridge
    the gap separating misused spectrum and the high demand for it [1]. Research has
    shown that significant portions of the licensed bands, as much as 80%, lie idle
    and unused for quality periods of time. Given the scarcity of the natural frequency
    spectrum, the usual static way of allocating this natural resource no doubt must
    be revisited by the authorities concerned. There is need to exploit innovative
    methods whereby available unused spectrum will be conveniently harnessed. The
    service of the original license holder however, must not be interrupted in the
    process. There has been a rapid increase in spectrum demand due to the deployment
    of a variety of wireless devices and emerging wireless services. The increasing
    diversities of communication applications have resulted in overcrowding of the
    allocated spectrum bands as well as scarcity of spectrum, resulting in poor service
    delivery and network problems [7]. The problem is mostly obvious in communication
    intensive situations such as after a major sports game or in a massive emergency
    such as earthquake or bomb attack. Moreover, the spectrum management policies
    which have hitherto protected and shaped the use of wireless spectrum prove to
    be stringent. Most of the frequency bands useful for wireless communication have
    already been licensed by the concerned authority. The few unlicensed bands, most
    notably the industrial scientific and medical (ISM) bands over which the immensely
    popular Wi-Fi devices transmit are filling up fast. Thus it appeared that we are
    approaching a spectral crisis if researches are not geared towards improving the
    spectral capability. Cognitive radio is the key enabling technology of dynamic
    spectrum access (DSA), which provides the capability to share the wireless channel
    with licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Unlicensed users/devices are allowed
    to identify the un-/underutilized portions of licensed spectrum and utilize them
    opportunistically as long as they do not cause any harmful interference to the
    legacy spectrum users'' communications. The temporarily unused portions of spectrum
    are called white spaces (WS) that may exist in time, frequency, and space domains.
    In the context of DSA, the legacy users are called primary users (PUs) and the
    CR users are called secondary users (SUs). In addition, due to its dynamic nature,
    DSA is also referred to as spectrum agility [2]. CR networks, however, impose
    unique challenges due to high fluctuation in the available spectrum, as well as
    the divers quality of service (QoS) requirements of various applications. In order
    to address these challenges, efficient spectrum management techniques must be
    employed; each CR user in the CR network must: Determine which portions of the
    spectrum are available Select the best available channel Coordinate access to
    this channel with other users Vacate the channel when a licensed user is detected.
    These capabilities can be realized through spectrum management functions such
    as spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing [3]. Cognitive Radio technology is thus
    a most viable means to harness the underutilized White Spaces, while solving the
    spectrum scarcity problem. However, it is imperative that a quality-of-service-framework
    for opportunistic spectrum sharing be adopted through robust management functions
    such as spectrum sensing and sharing. Therefore this work aims at provisioning
    quality of service in Cognitive Radio Networks using the protocol known as ZigBee
    protocol. SECTION II. Quality of Service (QoS) Parameters Quality of Service (QoS)
    can be defined as a low level “networking device visible attribute” such as delay,
    bandwidth, jitter and packet loss rate, or as a high level “user observable” like
    the quality of voice communication or video communication [4]. QoS can also be
    said to be the ability of the network to provide a service at an assured service
    level; or the capability of a network to provide better service to selected network
    traffic [3] [7]. The following are the basic network QoS characteristics: Bandwidth:
    This is the rate at which traffic is carried by the network. Latency: This defines
    the delay in data transmission from source to destination. Jitter: The variation
    in Latency Reliability: The percentage of packets discarded by a router. A. Quality
    of Service used in this Work The QoS parameters employed in this research work
    are as follows: Delay (sec): This is described as the end to end delay of all
    the packets received by the 802.15.4 MAC''s, say, of all WPAN nodes in the network
    and forwarded to the higher layer. Throughput (bits/sec): Represents the total
    number of bits (in bits/sec) forwarded from Medium Access Control (MAC) to higher
    layers in all nodes of the network in question. End-to-End Delay: This is total
    delay between creation and reception of an application packet. Traffic Sent (packet/sec):
    This is application traffic sent by the layer in packets/sec. In wireless networks,
    it is relatively difficult to reliably implement quality of service. The reason
    is due to high degree of variability. The underlying DSA protocol associated with
    Cognitive Radio has some side effects against QoS provisioning, coupled with the
    additional interference inherent in the CR system [4]. Disruptions from fundamental
    operations involved in DSA protocols can make deployment of QoS-sensitive applications
    infeasible. For instance, in order to maintain viability of DSA (including incumbent
    protection), the CR system must sense the channels frequently. This may result
    to violation of QoS requirements as it involves quiet periods which can disrupt
    the ongoing communication traffic. It is worthy of note that DSA can dynamically
    select and utilize better channels, hence is advantageous in providing sufficient
    resources for sustainable QoS in wireless systems. However, DSA operations must
    be properly scheduled and managed in conjunction with suitable safeguard mechanisms
    so as to provide reliable QoS [4]. SECTION III. The ZigBee Protocol and Wireless
    LAN ZigBee is a wireless technology developed as an open global standard and for
    a suite of high level communication protocols, used to address the unique needs
    of low-cost, low-power wireless M2M networks. The ZigBee protocol is of the IEEE
    802 family along with such protocols as WiFi and Bluetooth. It uses 2.4 GHz ISM
    radio band, 900MHz and 868 MHz [5]. ZigBee comprises of three layers, namely the
    application, network and the data link layer. The application layer gives the
    device its functionality. It converts the input into digital data, and/or vice
    versa. Directly below this layer is the network layer. It provides ZigBee functionality
    and acts as a buffer between application layer and data link layer (DLL) [6].
    More so, the network layer makes for the network structure, routing, and security
    such as encryption, authentication and key management. The data link layer is
    has two sub-layers - medium access control layer (MAC) and the physical layer
    (PHY) [7]. Figure 1. ZigBee stack Show All The IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC alongside
    with the application and network layers of ZigBee provide the following supports:
    Very low cost Ease of implementation Reliable transfer of data Short range operation
    Low power consumption High security levels Wireless LAN protocol is a set of media
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing
    wireless local area networks (WLAN) computer communication in the 2.4, 3.6, 5
    and 60 GHz frequency bands [8]. The wireless LAN stack protocols is also called
    the IEEE 802.11 class of protocol suites. Figure 2. Elements of a wireless LAN
    (WLAN) Show All An access point (AP) is the main part of the infrastructure to
    support a wireless LAN. The access point could be could be connected to one or
    more routers. The Aps as well as user devices in a wireless network are equipped
    with an identical radio interface commonly known as the IEEE 802.11 standard interface.
    The IEEE 802.11 standard specifies both the PHY (physical) and the MAC layers
    for constructing a wireless LAN. The PHY layer defines the air interface between
    two IEEE 802.11 equipped devices and the MAC layer defines the medium access control
    protocols to access the shared medium. SECTION IV. Experimental Setup/Simulation
    The OPNET MODELER simulation software was employed to simulate two wireless network
    environments. Two different wireless network protocols were separately implemented
    in each network to compare QoS provisioning by each of them in CRNs. The experimental
    setup consists of two cognitive radio networks in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein,
    South Africa, running two separate protocols: Wireless LAN MAC protocol (Wi-Fi)
    and ZigBee protocol. Figure 3. Two CRNs in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein Show
    All Inside each of the CRNs shown in figure 3 two small networks of area 100×100
    meters each, a pair of primary nodes (PU_1 and PU_2) are communicating with each
    other, and a pair of secondary nodes (SU_1 and SU_2) are opportunistically utilizing
    the spectrum and communicating with each other as shown in fig 4 and 5. The cognitive
    radio network in figure 4 implements Wi-Fi wireless LAN MAC protocol, while that
    in figure 5 implements the ZigBee protocol. Figure 4. Wireless LAN MAC CRN Show
    All Figure 5. ZigBee CRN Show All The network configurations in figure 4 are set
    up and monitored by the application and profile Definition nodes as can be seen
    in the figure. While in figure 5 the configurations are set up and monitored by
    the Coordinator node. The configuration utilities of the frameworks are responsible
    for controlling and monitoring the network and the traffic that go through it.
    For the Wireless LAN cognitive radio network, they include: 1) The Application
    Definition Utility The application definition and configuration object is added
    from the OPNET object pallet into the work space. Various application traffic
    can be configured in a framework using this object. In this project, we chose
    Ftp application to generate our traffic as shown in figure 6. Therefore in this
    work, we set the application to support Ftp High Load configuration. Figure 6.
    Application configuration Show All 2) The Profile Configuration Utility Profile
    configuration involves defining the various profiles within the defined application
    traffic. In this configuration, an Ftp profile was created as illustrated in figure
    7. Figure 7. Profile configuration Show All The ZigBee_Coordinator is added from
    the object pallet into the work space. The parameters are divided into MAC parameters,
    Physical Layer parameters and Network parameters. The coordinator provides similar
    functions as the application and profile definitions. We thus set up similar application
    traffic and configurations for the Z igBee CRN using this object, as illustrated
    in figure 8. Figure 8. ZigBee configuration Show All The statistics chosen before
    running the simulation in this work were commonly taken for the two CR networks
    being investigated, in order to obtain valid comparison between them. Figure 9.
    Choosing statistics Show All For the sake of comparison, in the two network scenarios
    in Figure 3, as much the same DES statistics as possible were chosen and the simulations
    were run individually for ten minutes. For convenience reasons, we will represent
    the protocols with their IEEE standard names; 802.11 for wireless LAN MAC protocol
    and 802.15.4 for the ZigBee protocol. SECTION V. Results The results of the experiments
    are as shown in the figures: A. Data Traffic Received (Packets/Sec) Figure 10.
    802.15.4 traffic sent & & received in packets/sec Show All Figures 10 and 11 show
    the statistics of traffic sent and received for 802.15.4 and 802.11 respectively.
    In figure 10 it can be seen that steady stream of traffic is sent and received
    without disruption. Only a few seconds elapsed at the beginning of the simulation
    which indicates management and control traffic sent and received to determine
    the presence of devices as the optimal route. Figure 11. 802.11 traffic sent &
    received in packets/sec Show All Figure 11 shows the statistics of traffic sent
    and received for 802.11. Unlike figure A, in fig B, there was a time lag of about
    100 seconds before traffic was sent and received. More so, there was unsteady
    stream of traffic. A. Throughput Throughput represents the total number of bits
    (bits/sec) forwarded from 802.15.4 or from 802.11, to higher layers in WPAN or
    WLAN nodes of the network respectively. Figure 12. 802.15.4 throughput (bit/sec)
    Show All Both protocols have their throughput hiking up almost instantaneously
    at the start of simulation. However, it took a longer time for 802.11 wireless
    LAN protocol. Plus it had a time lag. On the other hand, 802.15.4 ZigBee protocol
    rose very sharply in throughput and became stable quickly. This is as a result
    of QoS enabled parameters inherent in the ZigBee technology which makes for more
    efficiency. Figure 13. 802.11. Wireless LAN protocol Show All B. Delay This represents
    the end to end delay of all the packets received by the 802.15.4 MACs of all WPAN
    nodes in the network and forwarded to the higher layer. It is equally the end
    to end delay of all the packets received by the 802.11 MACs of all WLAN nodes
    in the network and forwarded to the higher layer. Figure 14: 802.15.4 delay (sec)
    Show All Figure 15: 802.11 delay (sec) Show All From the figures above, the wireless
    LAN MAC protocol had more delay compared to the QoS-enabled ZigBee protocol. C.
    Number of Hops This is the average number of hops travelled by application traffic
    in the WLAN or WPAN to reach an end device. Figure 16: 802.15.4 number of hops
    Show All Figure 17: 802.11 number of hops Show All From the figures above, the
    two protocols travelled over only one hop each to reach the end device, owing
    to the original similar network set-up for the two protocols. The results of the
    simulations confirm that the ZigBee protocol is a more robust protocol in terms
    of QoS provisioning in CRNs compared to the wireless LAN MAC protocol (Wi-Fi).
    With the 802.15.4 protocol, we had relatively lower packets of data dropped during
    transmission, as indicated by higher throughput. More so, the delay in data transfer
    was less. QoS as indicated earlier is difficult to implement in wireless networks
    [4]. Therefore, because the ZigBee protocol is by itself QoS-enabled, it is a
    better protocol for QoS provisioning in CR networks. SECTION VI. Conclusions Despite
    all the potentials of cognitive radio technology and all the resource management
    efficiency that it promises, there still are substantial challenges to be overcome;
    in such areas as spectrum discovery-mechanisms or sensing, spectrum sharing, network
    topology flexibility, spectrum-aware network architectures and so on. This research
    work was carried out to investigate some of the already-existing algorithms or
    protocols for provisioning quality of service (QoS) in cognitive radio. According
    to the simulation results, we conclude that the ZigBee protocol is more rewarding
    to implement in a CR network than wireless LAN MAC protocol (Wi-Fi was used).
    The IEEE 802.15.4 protocol dropped less data packets in communication transmission,
    generated higher throughput and had been seen to have relatively steadier stream
    of traffic sent with little or no disruption. In addition, the ZigBee standard
    provides network security and application support services operating on top of
    the IEEE 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) wireless
    standard. In summary, it is difficult to implement a quality of service framework
    in wireless networks as a whole. However, this relatively new IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
    called the ZigBee protocol is by design QoS-enabled, unlike the others such as
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth etc. Thus, employing the ZigBee protocol is a good approach for
    provisioning QoS in Cognitive Radio Networks. Authors Figures References Keywords

    Silicon Valley, CA, USA SECTION I. Introduction The evolution of wireless communications
    towards the 5G era involves a transformation in network design and evaluation
    that aims at placing the end-user at the center of any decision. As a result,
    resource management techniques for 5G networks need to be based on Quality of
    Experience (QoE) performance assessment [1]. The shift in performance assessment
    from objective Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics to subjective end user''s QoE
    metrics has been aided by a number of studies in multimedia quality assessment
    which have contributed techniques to estimate the QoE from objective measurements
    while retaining high correlation with the subjective perception of quality. Among
    these techniques, mean opinion score (MOS), a metric rating from 1 (bad) to 5
    (excellent), is the most widely used QoE metric, [2]. Importantly, by providing
    a single common measuring scale for different types of traffic, MOS provides the
    means to perform integrated traffic management and resource allocation across
    traffic of dissimilar characteristics (e.g. real-time video and data), [3]. The
    design of new resource management techniques based on QoE performance metrics
    still face the challenge derived from ever-present constrains in radio spectrum
    resources. The cognitive radio paradigm presents a powerful technology for effective
    and adaptive spectrum use that addresses this challenge. With a foresight on future
    5G scenarios where heterogeneous networks share a common spectrum band, this work
    will study cognitive QoE-based resource management for seamless integration of
    dissimilar traffic in an underlay DSA setting where primary users (PUs) and the
    secondary users (SUs) are allowed to transmit simultaneously over the same frequency
    band as long as the interference from the SUs to the PUs remains below a limit
    [4]. Following the transformation towards end-user centric network design for
    future 5G scenarios, a number of works have studied cognitive radio (CR) techniques
    based on QoE performance metrics. The works [5] and [6] focused on QoE provisioning
    in CR systems with multiple antennas. While [6] derived closed form expressions
    for three QoE indicators, [5] focused on the SU satisfaction only from the delay
    perspective. The authors in [1] proposed a QoE-driven spectrum handoff scheme
    and applied reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize the quality of video transmissions
    in the long term. In this paper, we consider the scenario of multiple SUs accessing
    a single spectrum band to transmit real-time video or regular data traffic. Our
    proposed underlay DSA technique adapts the transmit rate, and accordingly modulation
    scheme, and allocated transmit powers of all SUs so as to maximize average QoE
    across all active real-time video or regular data transmissions in the secondary
    network. Our main contribution in this paper is the application of the MOS as
    the common measurement scale of end user''s QoE for all types of traffic allowing
    seamless integration of dissimilar traffic (real-time video and data). Our proposed
    underlay resource allocation technique needs to meet the two contradicting goals
    of maximizing the average QoE while satisfying the constraint of the interference
    to the PU. This resource allocation problem is solved through discrete-time Markov
    decision process (DTMDP) modeling and the use of a reinforcement learning (RL).
    The RL learning [7] has been shown as an effective solution for the resource allocation
    in communication networks. The RL agent can generate near optimal solutions through
    an immediate reward achieved from interactions with the environment. Through optimizing
    the current reward, the RL agent achieves a long-term optimizing goal, which is
    important for dynamic systems such as wireless networks. The use of a common QoE
    metric on dissimilar traffic (MOS) also introduces new important questions. One
    such question is how the learned environment-action adaptation experience differs
    between cognitive radios carrying different types of traffic. A novel contribution
    of this work is to study this question by examining the performance differences
    seen between teaching of nodes carrying the same and different types of traffic
    using the idea of a docitive radio [8] which allows newcomer SUs learn from their
    more expert peers to improve the learning process. For this, we examine different
    docition scenarios where a new joined SU is taught by different groups of SUs
    with similar and dissimilar traffic and investigate the impact of different docition
    scenarios on the overall QoE. It will be shown that the docitive approach will
    reduce the number of iterations by approximately 65% without a performance difference
    whether learning is from teachers carrying the same or a different type of traffic.
    SECTION II. System Model We assume two wireless networks, a primary network (PN)
    and a secondary network (SN). The PN containing of a single primary link shares
    a single channel with SN at a given time instant under the typical underlay DSA
    technique. The SN serves N SUs randomly located around a secondary base station
    (SBS). All secondary and primary links transmit using adaptive modulation and
    coding (AMC) scheme. Every SUs adapts its transmit parameters in order to satisfy
    the interference requirements from the PU and the other SUs. The traffic carried
    over the SN links is real-time/streaming video and regular data. The transmissin
    channel is assumed as a quasi-static channel along with additive white Gaussian
    noise. The PU adopts AMC technique while its transmit power is assumed as a constant
    number. Under this assumption, the SUs can infer the channel state information
    (CSI) through active learning, [9], and then estimate the channel gains. We design
    underlay DSA technique based on the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR)
    requirement which is the translation of the interference requirements. The SINR
    at the primary base station (PBS), SINR(p) and the SINR for the ith. SU at its
    corresponding SBS, SINR(s) are expressed as: SIN R (p) = G (p) 0 P 0 σ 2 + ∑ N
    j=1 G (p) j P j , SIN R i (s) = G (s) i P i σ 2 + G (s) 0 P 0 + ∑ j≠i G (s) j
    P j , (1) (2) View Source where P0 is the PU transmit power, which is a constant
    number, Pj is jth. SU’s transmit power, G (p) 0 is the channel gain between PU
    and PBS and G (p) j is jth. SU’s channel gain to the PBS, G (s) 0 is the channel
    gain between PU and the ith. SBS, r (s) i is the ith. SU’s transmit rate, Pi is
    the ith. SU’s transmit power, G (s) i is ith. SU’s channel gain, while σ2 is the
    noise power. To meet the underlay DSA and QoE goals, we impose constraints on
    secondary and primary SINRs as follow: { SIN R (p) ≥ β 0 SIN R (s) i ≥ β i ,i=1,⋯,N.
    (3) View Source where β0 and βi are primary and secondary SINR threshold, respectively.
    When both SINR constraints are assumed with equality, allocated transmission power
    for each SU can be derived as, [10], ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ P i = Ψ i ( σ 2 + G (s)
    0 P 0 ) G (s) i (1− ∑ N j=1 Ψ j ) ,i=1,2,…,N, Ψ i = (1+ 1 β i ) −1 (4) View Source
    In order to have a valid power allocation the condition 1− ∑ N i=1 Ψ i >0 needs
    to be met. After replacing the SU powers obtained from (4) in (1), equation (3)
    can be rewritten as, ∑ N j=1 α j Ψ j ≤1, (5) View Source where α j = G (p) j (
    σ 2 + G (s) 0 P 0 ) G (s) j ( G (p) 0 P 0 / β 0 − σ 2 ) +1. (6) View Source Since
    β0 is assumed as a constant number, βi needs to be adjusted at each SU in order
    to meet the equations (4) and (5). This adjustment can be done by adapting the
    transmit bit rate. Based on the work [11] for the considered system setup, the
    relation between transmit bit rate and the SU threshold SINR can be written as,
    r (s) i =W log 2 (1+k β i ), (7) View Source where M(βi) = (1 + kβi) shows the
    number of bits per modulation symbol and takes practically only a small number
    of integer values, and k= 1.5 −ln(5BER) is a constant which relates to a target
    maximum transmit bit error rate (BER) requirement. For our proposed underlay DSA
    scheme in this paper, each SU select its target SINR βi and accordingly r (s)
    i , so that all SU cooperately meet the SINR constraints in (3) and (5). By adjusting
    the βi and consequently corresponding r (s) i , the modulation scheme is adjusted.
    Our optimization task is to maximize the network performance metric while satisfying
    a total interference constraint to the primary user. As the representative of
    end-user centric quality assessment, QoE is gaining significant attention as we
    are moving toward 5G era. Consequently, we opted QoE as the network performance
    metric to assess the quality of the delivered traffic. Among the metrics used
    to model the QoE, MOS was chosen as it is the most widely used metric to model
    the delivered traffic QoE. Thus, the network is optimized based on average QoE
    of all video and data sessions transmitted by SUs. In the following, we present
    the MOS formulas which are utilized in this paper to quantify quality for delivered
    data and video traffic. A. Data MOS Model Based on the work [3], the MOS for data
    traffic is calculated as follow: Q D =a log 10 (b r (s) i (1− p e 2 e )), (8)
    View Source where QD, pe2e and r (s) i are the data traffic MOS, end-to-end packet
    loss probability and data transmit bit rate, respectively. The parameters a and
    b are calculated using the maximum and minimum perceived data quality by the end-user.
    If transmit rate of a user is R and the effective receive rate is also R, then
    the packet loss rate is zero, the quality perceived rate of the end-user in terms
    of MOS should be maximum, that is 5. While MOS value of 1 is assigned to a minimum
    transmission rate. In this work a = 1.3619 and b = 0.6780. B. Video MOS Model
    As video quality assessment metric, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is commonly
    accepted to objectively measure the coding performance of video. However, it is
    known that PSNR does not accurately reflect subjective human perception of video
    quality [12]. A wide variety of techniques have been proposed to estimate user
    satisfaction for video applications (a survey of video quality assessments can
    be found in [2]), among which [13] proposed a simple linear mapping between PSNR
    and MOS, as shown in Fig 1, which assigns MOS value of 4.5 for PSNR of 40 dB and
    MOS value of 1 for PSNR of 20 dB. The limits arise from the fact that received
    video sequences experiencing PSNR equal to 40 dB are almost indistinguishable
    from the transmitted one and those below 20 dB exhibit very severe quality degradations
    [13]. The work in [14] presented the heuristic mappings from PSNR to MOS as shown
    in Table I, while, according to the recommendation ITU-R BT.500-13 [15], the relationship
    between MOS and an objective measure of picture distortion have a sigmoid shape.
    Consequently, [16] claimed that if the picture distortion is measured with an
    objective metric, e.g., PSNR (dB), then a logistic function can be used to characterize
    the relation between MOS and PSNR, as follows: Q V = c 1+exp(d(PSNR−f)) , (9)
    View Source where QV denotes the MOS for video, and c, d and f are the parameters
    of the logistic function. In this paper, we selected the logistic function to
    evaluate the quality of video traffic. To compute the parameters of the logistic
    function (9), an array of PSNR and corresponding MOS values is needed. TABLE I
    Possible PSNR to MOS Conversion [14] Since the PSNR of reconstructed video changes
    as a function of bit rate with the characteristics of the video sequence itself,
    we averaged over the PSNR-bit rate functions for multiple MPEG-4 coded video sequences
    at different resolutions, 240p, 360p and 480p and obtained one average PSNR-bit
    rate curve. The video sequences were combined in the respective proportions 39%,
    32% and 28%, same as the proportions used in [17]. The video sequences used were
    \"Flowervase\" and \"Race Horses\", at 30 frames per second (fps) and resolution
    480p, while for resolution 360p \"Tennis\" and \"Park Scene\" at 24 fps were selected.
    As a result, it was observed that a function of the form PSNR=klog r (s) i +p
    can be used to very closely approximate the average PSNR-bit rate curve, where
    r (s) i is the video transmission bit rate and k and p are constants. In this
    work k = 10.4 and p = −28.7221. To get the parameters of the logistic function
    formula as in (9) an array of PSNR values and its corresponding MOS values is
    needed. In this paper, we first computed PSNR values for an array of video bit
    rate (which itself computed through equation (7) for all candidate actions) using
    combined PSNR-bit rate curve. To get MOS values corresponding to the computed
    PSNR values, we used linear mapping to map PSNR to MOS. We also used table-based
    conversion to obtain another array of MOS values for the same PSNR values. Then
    we averaged the two MOS arrays to obtain final MOS array. After obtaining the
    MOS value corresponding to the PSNR values, the parameters of logistic function
    can be achieved. in this work c = 6.6431, d = −0.1344 and f = 30.4264. Fig. 1.
    MOS versus PSNR Show All Since MOS as a common quality assessment metric for all
    type of traffics allows to do resource allocation for traffics of all type in
    an integrated way, we are allowed to add MOS for all video and data sessions,
    as follow: 1 N ( ∑ U i=1 Q D + ∑ N i=U+1 Q V ) , where U is the number of SUs
    transmitting data while the remaining N − U users transmit streaming video. By
    adjusting βi, and consequently corresponding r (s) i , the SU tries to obtain
    an optimal power assignment in order to not only satisfies the interference thresholds
    in (3) but maximize the network performance metric (MOS). SECTION III. Problem
    Formulation for Individual SU Q-Learning The reinforcement learning (RL) approach
    required the definition of a set of states S, a set of actions A and a reward
    function representing the effect of selected action on an environment from which
    each of the learning agents will be guide to choose the next action from A. The
    same set of actions as well as states are assumed for all SUs. Each SU conducts
    a search into the finite discrete space of candidate target SINR, denoted by A
    (i) ={ β (i) 1 ,⋯, β (i) n } to find the optimal solution which not only meet
    the constraints in (3) but results in the better MOS through a CR-based reinforcement
    learning approach. As a RL method, a Q-Learning algorithm [18], is opted in this
    paper to solve the problem of resource allocation. The Q-Learning algorithm considers
    the environment as a finite-state, discrete-time stochastic dynamical system.
    The learning agent observes its current state s∈S and accordingly take an action
    π(s)∈A, under a certain policy π, which involves scalar immediate reward R (i)
    t . The problem then is to find a policy which maximizes the received discounted
    reward V with a discount factor γ(0 < γ < 1), [18]. At the same time with choosing
    one strategy from A(i), each SU adapts its transmit power and other related transmission
    parameters, then observes the changes in the system and its own transmission as
    well. Each SUs will seek to find an optimal policy to maximize its own MOS while
    the SINR constraints (3) are satisfied. The states, St = (It, Li), are defined
    to reflect the interference caused by the SUs where I t ={ 0, 1, if ∑ N i=1 Ψ
    i ( β (i) t )<1 otherwise, L t ={ 0, 1, if ∑ N i=1 α i Ψ i ( β (i) t )≤1 otherwise.
    (10) (11) View Source The reward function is also defined as a function of the
    state and the local action, R (i) t ( a t , s t )={ M, Q (i) (DorV) , if I t+1
    + L t+1 >0 otherwise, (12) View Source with the assumption of M being a constant
    smaller than the reward of any other strategies in exchange of taken an unsuccessful
    action resulting in interference constraints violation (3). While in the case
    of satisfying the interference constraints, MOS of the received traffic which
    is either video (QV) or data (QD) is considered as the immediate reward. We also
    assume that the SUs do not know the other''s action or the effect of joint actions
    on states and considers the others as part of the environment. Then the SUs repeatedly
    make their decisions and finally obtain their optimal policies to maximize the
    expected sum of discounted reward: V i (s,π)= ∑ ∞ t=0 γ t E( R (i) t |π, s 0 =s),i=1,2,…,N,
    (13) View Source where π is the local strategy and s0 = s is the initial state.
    According to Bellman’s principle of optimality [19], the solution to (13) can
    be obtained by taking the optimal action if all the strategies thereafter are
    optimal: V ∗ i (s, π ∗ )= max a [R(s,a)+γ ∑ s ′ p( s ′ |s,a) V i ( s ′ , π ∗ )].
    (14) View Source Further, V ∗ i (s, π ∗ ) in (14) can be approached by the Q-function,
    which is updated as follows: Q i t+1 (s, a i t )=(1− α t ) Q i t (s, a i t )+
    α t [ R i t (s, a i t )+γ Q i∗ t ( s ′ )], (15) View Source where αt is the learning
    rate, 0 < αt(s, a) < 1 and Q i∗ t ( s ′ ) is the ith. SU’s Q-value corresponding
    to the stage maximum Q i∗ t ( s ′ )= max b Q i t (b, s ′ ) in the new state s′
    after a i t at is taken. Consequently, the problem of finding a transmit power
    and corresponding bit rate becomes that of finding the optimal ( β ^ i ) and the
    optimal secondary network spectrum use problem is formulated as: {( β ^ i )}=
    argmax β i ∑ N i=1 Q i(DorV) ( β i ), s.t. ∑ N i=1 Ψ i ( β i )≤1−ε, ∑ N j=1 α
    j Ψ j ( β j )≤1. (16) View Source In order to be able to maximize the average
    quality measurement of all received traffics, the quality of data or video received
    in the SUs receivers needs to be added. As mentioned before as the contribution
    of this paper, MOS has been used as QoE metric as it provides a common quality
    assessment metric for traffics of all type. Algorithm 1 summarizes the steps needs
    to be taken by each SU in order to implement the individual learning mechanism.
    It should be noted that because of the initialization for all the SUs Q i 0 =0
    , the algorithm will first perform an initial exploration phase, where each Q-table
    entry is visited once, then will through an exploitation phase. SECTION IV. SU
    Docition-based Cooperative Learning As mentioned in the previous section, Q-learning
    algorithm develops (learns) iteratively a Q-table that stores the reward for each
    action. Each Cognitive SUs first learns about its surrounding environment then
    continues with a choice of action associated with the largest reward, obtains
    the reward of the selected action by running Q-learning algorithm, and finally
    updates its Q-table based on the received immediate reward. Therefore, the Q-table
    will reflect the effects of the actions on the wireless environment. Because part
    of the wireless environment involves the interference created by each SU to the
    rest of the system, the Q-table will reflect both the individual local wireless
    environment for each SU and the collective interrelation between the system components
    [20]. When a SU joint the already learnt system, this environment shows limited
    changes, therefore it is inefficient to re-run the cognitive cycle and disregard
    the awareness of the environment captured by other SUs already in system. Hence,
    this awareness of the environment which is reflected in Q-table can be taught
    to the new joint SU in order to decrease the learning time and also improve the
    learning performance. This paradigm denoted as docitive radio. While the emphasis
    in CR is to learn, docitive radio focuses on teaching. Under docitive paradigm
    the nodes with more \"experience\" for solving a specific system problem will
    teach less able nodes so as to decrease the learning time and also improve the
    learning performance [21]. As a result, we introduce a docitive approach where
    SUs already existing in the network initialize their cognitive cycle with their
    own Q-tables already learnt through Algorithm 1 and the newcomer SU initialize
    its Q-table obtained by averaging the Q-tables from the existing users. In the
    next section, we examine the effects of initialization of Q-table of joint SU
    by averaging the Q-tables from SUs with similar and dissimilar traffic types on
    the learning performance. Q c = 1 N ∑ N i=1 Q (i) . (17) View Source Algorithm
    1 Individual learning for resource allocation The mentioned docitive mechanism
    is shown in Algorithm 2. Moreover, a low bit rate control channel is assumed as
    an indication if a newcomer (less experienced node) joins the network. SECTION
    V. Simulation Results The performance of the presented CR resource allocation
    algorithm was studied through Monte Carlo simulation. A primary network consists
    of one PU accessing a single channel with the bandwidth of 10MHz was assumed.
    The target SINR for the PU is set to be 10dB. The Gaussian noise power and the
    transmit power of PU are set to be 1nW and 10mW respectively. Both SUs and PUs
    are distributed randomly around their respective base stations within a circle
    of radius 200m and 1000m respectively. Channel gains follow a log-distance path
    loss model with path loss exponent equal to 2.8. For a single SU, its SINR could
    be chosen from the finite set {−5, −3, −1,1,3,5, 7, 9,11,13,15} dB. The SUs transmit
    using BPSK or QAM modulation (depending on the SINR in which algorithm converges).
    Regarding to the learning algorithm, the same learning rate α = 0.1 and discounting
    factor γ= 0.4 are assumed for all SUs. Algorithm 2 Cooperative Learning (Docition)
    Performance is evaluated based on measuring, as a function of the SUs number available
    in the network, the change in average MOS of the SUs achieved at the convergence
    point, in congestion rate in the SU, and in average total number of iterations
    needed for algorithms 1 and 2 to be converged. In the evaluation, congestion rate
    is the percentage of cases for which one or both of the SINR constraints would
    be violated when all SUs remain within acceptable level of distortion. The maximum
    SU number is set at 25 because as it can be seen in Fig 2 this number of SUs results
    in an average MOS more than 3 which is considered as an acceptable MOS level in
    terms of end-user quality perception. The performance of six different systems
    was compared during simulations while all systems performing a physical-layer
    CR adaptation learning technique: a system called \"Newcomer-Individual Learning\"
    where all SUs performs individual learning implemented in Algorithm 1, and five
    other systems, called \"New Comer-Docition\", \"New Comer-Docition similar traffic\",
    \"New Comer-Docition dissimilar traffic\", \"New Comer-Docition nearest neighbor\"
    and \"New Comer-Docition random neighbor\", respectively, consider one SU joining
    the already learned network. While the first system performs individual learning
    for the joined SU and re-run Algorithm 1, disregarding the intelligence acquired
    by SUs already in the network, the others teach the joined SU through the \"Docitive\"
    approach implemented in Algorithm 2. \"New Comer-Docition\" cooperative learning
    system assigns all SUs already in the system to learn from, and initiate the joined
    SU Q-values using (17), while, as the names indicate, \"New Comer-Docition similar
    traffic\" cooperative learning system assigns partners with similar traffic type
    to learn from and initiate the joined SU Q-values by averaging over Q-values of
    the users transmitting as the same traffic type as the joined SU, \"New Comer-Docition
    dissimilar traffic\" assigns partners with dissimilar traffic type to learn from,
    \"New Comer-Docition nearest neighbor\" cooperative learning system assigns partner
    based on proximity, and \"New Comer-Docition random neighbor\" assigns partner
    at random. Fig. 2. Average MOS in SN. Show All Figs. 2 to 4 show, respectively,
    the results for average MOS, congestion rate and average number of iterations.
    The results show that the docition algorithm (Algorithm. 2) is able to reduce
    the average number of iteration to convergence roughly by 2/3 from the individual
    learning algorithm. In all figures, the last five system performing cooperative
    learning have almost the same performance as all using doction with the difference
    in the number of partners selected to learn from. Fig. 2 shows, the average MOS
    of secondary network at convergence point, as a function of total number of SUs
    in SN. It can be seen how the average network MOS decreases as the number of SUs
    increases. The reason for that is that to meet the interference constraints as
    the number of users increases, each SU tend to converge in a less SINR value which
    overall results in a less average MOS. This result also shows that our QoE-driven
    resource allocation algorithm obtains a high MOS values (always more than acceptable
    MOS level (QoE>3), even when 25 number of SUs exist in the network). It also can
    be seen that all system have the same performance in terms of MOS, and the reason
    for that is that MOS also enables docition between individual CR nodes that carry
    different types of traffic from each other. This is because while actual MOS values
    may differ between different types of traffic, the relation between the rewards
    obtained for different wireless states and actions is maintained (this is, rewards
    that are relatively higher than others remain with the same relation because of
    MOS and that the way is calculated is always through monotonically increasing
    functions of objective quality measures or QoS values). Fig. 3. Congestion rate.
    Show All Fig. 3 shows, congestion rate as a function of the number of SUs in the
    network. Fig. 3 also is used to determine the range of simulation choice of the
    SUs number for a defined congestion rate of the system. Based on this figure,
    if it is decided that the secondary network operates at a predefined congestion
    rate, the cooperative learning solution always accepts more number of users. Fig.
    4 shows the efficiency of utilizing docitive paradigm in accurate transforming
    the awareness of the surrounding environment to the new comer by experienced peers
    and reducing the number of iterations needed to achieve convergence. It can be
    seen that the number of iterations needed to achieve convergence is reduced by
    as much as 65% compared to individual learning algorithm. Fig. 4. Average number
    of cycles at the convergence point. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In accordance
    with the evolution of resource management techniques for 5G network, in this paper
    we presented an underlay DSA technique that allows to adapts transmit power, modulation
    scheme and accordingly transmit rate of all SUs to maximize average QoE across
    all traffics of dissimilar characteristics (real-time video and regular data traffic)
    in the secondary network while satisfying the interference constraints to the
    PU transmission. MOS is exploited as an metric to model the subjective QoE as
    it not only meets the end-user centric quality assessment requirements of 5G networks,
    but enables the seamless integration of dissimilar traffic by providing a single
    common measuring scale for different types of traffic. In addition, to improve
    the convergence time of the RL algorithm we applied the idea of a docitive radio
    which allows newcomer SUs learn from their more expert peers to improve the learning
    process. The use of MOS as performance metric to integrate dissimilar traffic
    allows to study for the first time the teaching between nodes that carry different
    types of traffic. For this, we examine different docition scenarios where a new
    joined SU is taught by different groups of SUs with similar and dissimilar traffic
    and investigate the impact of different docition scenarios on the overall QoE.
    Simulation results show all system have the same performance in terms of MOS,
    and the reason for that is that MOS also enables docition between individual CR
    nodes that carry different types of traffic from each other. Simulation results
    also show that the presented cooperative CR algorithm based on docition reduce
    the number of iterations by approximately 65% while preserving the average MOS
    always more than acceptable level. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: Dynamic spectrum access is regarded as an emerging approach to enhance
    the RF spectrum utilization in future cognitive wireless networks where unlicensed

    idle channels to use opportunistically without creating any harmful interference
    to primary users. Recently, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated
    that all unlicensed secondary users must query a spectrum database for channel
    opportunities instead of sensing by themselves to avoid any channel sensing uncertainties
    and harmful interference to primary users. However, database query process for

    the idle channel information from the grid leaders. To avoid any outliers in the
    grid, we use the majority voting among grid leaders. We evaluate the performance
    of the proposed approach using numerical results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations
    and numerical results show that the performance of the query process can be significantly
    enhanced with Group-Query-as-a-Service.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Honolulu, HI, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    With the successful development of lightweight hand-held devices and deployment
    of Wi-Fi and cellular wireless networks over the past decades, wireless networking
    is regarded as a viable mean of communications for emerging applications such
    as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) [1]–[3] Most of the
    usable RF spectrum are already allocated/licensed for service providers for long
    time and vast geographic area [4], [5] and these licensed RF spectrum are accessible
    only by licensed primary users. However, recent studies have shown that most of
    licensed bands are underutilized or idle most of the time even on highly populated
    cities like Washington DC, New York, Los Angles and Chicago [5], [6]. This “artificial
    scarcity” of the RF spectrum is due to static licensing to wireless service providers.
    Dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks is regarded as an emerging
    approach for accessing idle or underutilized RF spectrum by unlicensed secondary
    users [5], [6]. Secondary users are required to sense RF spectrum to find idle
    or underutilized channels and use them opportunistically without creating any
    harmful interference to licensed primary users. However, spectrum sensing process
    consumes resources such as battery of mobile devices. Furthermore, the wireless
    devices need wide-band sensing hardware and mechanism to sense wide-bands. Sensing
    approach could also have high uncertainties that leads to harmful interference
    to licensed primary users while accessing spectrum opportunities. Recently, the
    US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated that all unlicensed secondary
    users must query a spectrum database for channel opportunities instead of sensing
    channels by themselves to avoid any channel sensing uncertainties and possible
    harmful interference to licensed primary users [7], [8]. Database driven dynamic
    spectrum access is expected to i) reduce delay that is caused by computationally
    complex sensing approaches, ii) to reduce channel sensing uncertainties by minimizing
    the probability of false alarm and miss detection, and iii) minimize any harmful
    interference to primary users due to channel sensing uncertainties. However, for
    high density of secondary users, the spectrum database query process can easily
    overwhelm the communications when there are many secondary users requesting the
    same information from the spectrum database server, which could easily lead do
    a denial-of-service attack. Note that recently proposed database driven approaches
    consider each secondary user query the database individually [7], [9], [10] In
    this paper, we investigate a Group-Query-as-a-Service for dynamic spectrum access
    in geolocation-enabled database-driven opportunistic cognitive wireless networks.
    In the Group-Query-as-a-Service approach, secondary users form a group based-on
    location based grids. Within the given grid, a limited number of secondary users
    of the given group, known as grid leaders, query the spectrum database and let
    the other follower secondary users know about the idle channels. Grid leaders
    are selected based on their past level of interactions and trust they have in
    the group or grid. Grid leaders query the database on behalf of other secondary
    users periodically to get the updated idle channel information. Note that when
    a new user joins the grid, it may not be qualified to be a leader, so instead
    of querying the database, it gets the idle channel information from the grid leaders.
    In order to avoid any outliers in the grid, we use a majority voting among grid
    leaders. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical
    results obtained from extensive simulation. For the Group-Query-as-a-Service,
    it is important to find a suitable size of the grid where we use the user density
    as a metric to find the size of the grid. Recent related works regarding grid
    size include [11]– [14]. None of these approaches are applicable to grid based
    dynamic spectrum access applications for Group-Query-as-a-Service where grid leaders
    communicate on behalf of other secondary users. This work is based on a near real-time
    spectrum sensing and opportunistic spectrum access in cognitive radio network
    (ROAR) framework [7], [15] where spectrum sensors detect idle channels by using
    energy and spectrum width detection and report that information to the cloud computing
    unit where CASSANDRA and Storm are integrated for real-time distributed computing
    and storage [7], [16]. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A
    brief overview of the ROAR architecture is presented in Section II. Section III
    discusses the grid formation and clustering process. The performance evaluation
    is presented in Section IV followed by the conclusions in Section V. SECTION II.
    Brief Overview of the ROAR Architecture ROAR architecture consists of spectrum
    sensing, cloud computing, and dynamic spectrum access for opportunistic communications
    as shown in Fig. 1. Spectrum Sensing Sensor devices independent of the secondary
    users periodically scan the RF spectrum and report the scanned information along
    with the geolocation (longitude, latitude and altitude) and time stamp to the
    cloud. Information sensing could also be performed through external infrastructure
    or primary network infrastructure. While sensing the spectrum, ROAR uses both
    energy of the signal and width of the signal spectrum to reduce channel sensing
    uncertainties [7]. Cloud Computing for Spectrum Processing and Heat Map For distributed
    computing and storage we use Cassandra and Storm Systems [17] [18]. Cassandra
    is an open source NoSQL distributed database, currently used by Twitter. Storm
    programming is used to process data in a distributed manner. Furthermore, a spectrum
    heat map is created to visualize the spectrum occupancy information. The spectrum
    occupancy visualization is created using Google Map and Google API for plotting
    locations of the spectrum opportunities. Dynamic Spectrum Access As mandated by
    the US FCC, unlicensed secondary users query the spectrum database to find idle
    channels to use them for opportunistic communications. If ROAR architecture returns
    idle channels for a given location and time, secondary users will be able to communicate
    using those channels. If there are no idle channels available for a given location
    and time, secondary users will not get a chance for opportunistic communication.
    If there are multiple idle channels available, the secondary users choose the
    best suited channel for their communications. SECTION III. The Proposed Approach:
    Group-Query-as-a-Service This Section presents the proposed approach called Group-Query-as-a-Service
    where a location-based grid is formed based on user density and interest to search
    for spectrum opportunities. Among the number of secondary users within a given
    grid, selected number of secondary users form a leader group, also known as grid
    leaders. These grid leaders query the spectrum database on behalf of the other
    secondary users, also known as grid followers. Grid leaders are selected based
    on their past interactions and trust levels in the grid. Note that when many users
    query the same database, they will receive the same results, which introduces
    redundant link occupancy for the same result. In case of frequent mobility of
    a secondary user, it is required to request a new spectrum access for every geolocation
    context change. With this, a mobile secondary user spends more resources in requesting
    for idle channels than establishing connection. This research work aims at addressing
    these concerns by proposing a mobility-aware grid architecture for spectrum access
    in the ROAR. A. Contour (AKA grid) Formation for Sensed Data in the ROAR Framework
    As discussed, we visualize the spectrum occupancy information in ROAR framework,
    as shown in Fig. 1. When multiple spectrum sensors are located within the close
    proximity of each other with same idle channel information, ROAR does not have
    to store all channels for all locations. In this case, we consider a contour (of
    size, say, 50 meter) to consolidate the geolocation and channels info within the
    same contour. This approach helps not only to have better representation and visualization
    but also to query the spectrum database effectively for the secondary users. The
    grouping process for forming a contour/grid is dependent on computed affinity
    values between geolocation data points. Note that the motivation of aggregating
    data points with proximity in geo-location and same reported idle channels is
    to form a contour. A contour is formed across data points that satisfy the aggregation
    conditions for easy statistical analysis and group-based query for the Group-Query-as-a-Service.
    The affinity matrix A for the n×n data points for geolocation with similar idle
    channel information can be represented as: A= ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ a 1,1 a 2,1 ⋮ a n,1
    a 1,2 a 2,2 ⋮ a n,2 ⋯ ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ a 1,n a 2,n ⋮ a n,n ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (1) View Source
    where a i,j is the affinity between two data points i and j in the geolocation
    database. The affinity a i,j can be computed as a i,j =f{ d t ij , γ t } (2) View
    Source where d t i,j represents the distance between locations i and j . This
    d t ij can be calculated using Haversine distance formula [7] by using a function
    of the longitude points ( ϕ 1 , ψ 1 ) and latitude points ( ϕ 2 , ψ 2 ) as d t
    ij =2R sin −1 sin 2 ( ϕ d 2 )+cos( ϕ 1 )cos( ϕ 2 ) sin 2 ( ψ d 2 ) − − − − − −

    radius, ϕ d = ϕ 1 − ϕ 2 , and ψ d = ψ 1 − ψ 2 . A typical maximum value of d th
    will be the transmission range of primary infrastructure and its minimum value
    could be as small as 10 meters for a given time t . The γ t is the signal strength
    that the user is expected to receive at that location. Fig. 1. The ROAR architecture

    clustering, we leverage an affinity function of geolocation and reported idle
    channels as mentioned above. We have summarized the algorithmic steps as Algorithm
    1. Note that this contour with the clustered information is used to save the query
    time for secondary users with the help of distributed computing as shown in Fig.
    1. Algorithm 1 Dynamic Spectrum Data Aggregation B. Grid/contour Formation for
    Secondary Users for Group-Query-as-a-Service We assume that the S n number of
    secondary users are randomly distributed in a given area and let''s denote them
    as a set S as S={ S 1 , S 2 ,…, S n } (4) View Source The given area is divided
    into non-overlapping grids as shown in Fig. 2 based on the secondary users'' interest

    A Grid Formation for Secondary Users (SUs) C. Election for Grid Leaders in Group-Query-as-a-Service
    In Group-Query-as-a-Service, a selected percentage of the secondary users in a
    grid are elected to be grid leaders (GLs). GLs are responsible for aggregating
    spectrum access requests and send a query to the server on behalf of other follower
    secondary users who are looking for the same information in a given location and
    time. Then GLs forward the response received from server to follower secondary
    users. This approach does not only ensure seamless aggregation of grid nodes request
    and response, it also provides protection against possible denial of service attack.
    First, x % of total secondary users in the grid are selected as candidates to
    be GLs. These candidate GLs go through a process that considers the trust and
    past interaction to be the actual GLs. If no GL candidates meet the criteria based
    on this process is repeated until one or more GLs are selected. Algorithmic steps
    for selecting GLs are summarized as Algorithm 3. For a given grid g , the status
    of a secondary user s is either a GL or a follower secondary user, which can be
    expressed as s g ={ Grid Leader(GL) Follower Secondary User(FSU) if  β s g =1
    otherwise (8) View Source where β s g ∈[0,1] represents the evaluated eligibility
    indication. Specifically, the GL election process starts with a random nomination
    of secondary users within a grid. Each nominated secondary user is then evaluated
    based on GL eligibility criteria. The first criteria is the resource threshold
    which is subject to, but not limited to, battery power, signal strength, etc.
    The other eligibility criteria is a trust, which uses a hierarchical trust based
    model comprising of interactive trust and honesty trust. Interactive trust is
    the measure of successful interactions by a secondary user with other secondary
    users within the grid. When a secondary user changes grid due to mobility, this
    value is not maintained. This metric allows us to elect a secondary user that
    has been engaged for a considerable duration within the grid as GL. The honesty
    trust is a measure of the truthfulness about the reported location of a secondary
    user. A node being nominated as GL sends a control signal broadcasting its location
    to nodes that are within its transmission range. The eligibility function for
    a GL can be expressed as β s g =( r s g ( r s g + τ s g )/2)/( r s g − τ s g )
    (9) View Source where r s g is the resource metric such as battery status, signal
    strength, etc. and τ s g is the overall trust metric. The overall trust metric
    τ s g is computed as a weighted function of the interactive trust ( τ i s g )
    and honesty trust τ h s g and can be expressed as τ s g =α τ i s g +(1−α) τ h
    s g (10) View Source where α=[0,1] is the weight for interactive trust ( τ i s
    g ) and honesty trust τ h s g . After GLs are selected they communicate on behalf
    of all other follower secondary users as shown in Fig. 3. When follower secondary
    users receive idle channel information from multiple GLs in the grid, they compare
    the copies of the information received from different GLs. In order to avoid any
    outliers, each follower secondary user uses the weighted majority voting mechanism
    to find the trustworthiness of the message as τ m =1 if  ∑ l=1 | G L | τ l s g
    > | G L | 2 ,  τ m =0 otherwise View Source This τ m value is used to find interactive
    and honesty trusts that gives τ s g in (10) by leveraging the information whether
    the GL has been an outlier in the past and now, and how long have been a GL in
    the given grid. Each GL receives positive point from the follower secondary users
    if it is trustworthy, which then can be used for next round of GL selection. This
    mechanism forces GLs not to mislead the query process which essentially protects
    the systems from any malicious GLs. Note that the motivation of being GL is that
    it gets the channel information earlier than other follower secondary users that
    can be fairly shared with them. Fig. 3. A typical grid leader formation in a grid.
    Show All Algorithm 3 Electing Grid Leaders When a secondary user moves, its location
    parameters change and it will be associated to another grid based on the location.
    Secondary users participate into group formation, information aggregation and
    coordinate with GL in corresponding grid. SECTION IV. Performance Evaluation The
    performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained
    by running simulations and experiments in ROAR framework. Secondary users were
    assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the given area. First, we plotted
    the query overhead vs. moving probability of secondary users, as shown in Fig.
    4. We observed that the query overhead at the server coming from the secondary
    user for querying the spectrum database is significantly higher when individual
    secondary users query the database than that of grid based approach. In the grid
    based approach, when GLs or follower secondary users move, they become follower
    in the new grid and get the information from GLs of the new grid instead of querying
    the spectrum server. This results in significant decrease in query overhead at
    the server, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, query overhead is increasing for
    both approaches with the moving probability of the secondary user. Fig. 4. Comparison
    of grid-based spectrum query and individual query approaches vs. The moving probability
    of the secondary user in ROAR framework. Show All Fig. 5. Variation of per-user
    throughput vs. The moving probability of secondary users for grid based and individual
    query approaches. Show All Next we plotted the comparison of per-user throughput
    vs. the number of secondary users for te grid-based approach and individual query
    approach, as shown in Fig. 5. We observed that the per-user throughput decreases
    when number of users increases because more users compete to query and get the
    channel access for communications. Per-user throughput is higher in the proposed
    grid-based approach than that in individual query based approach, as shown in
    Fig. 5. Fig. 6. Variation of idle channel request delay vs. The query iteration
    for a number of secondary users as gls for grid-based approach and individual
    query approaches when we had 100 secondary users present in the given area for
    dynamic spectrum access through ROAR framework. In grid-based approach gls varied
    from 1 to 100 with an interval of 10 for each iteration, and gls queried the database
    on behalf of other secondary users. However, in individual query approach, all
    100 secondary users queried all the time. Each query takes about a millisecond
    to get the response back. Show All Then, we plotted the delay for secondary users
    to get idle channel information vs the number of GLs as shown in Fig. 6. We observed
    that grid based approach has lesser delay than the individual approach when few
    GLs are selected. However, delay increases with the number of GLs as shown in
    Fig. 6. When all secondary users are selected as GLs in the grid, which is equivalent
    to individual query approach, delay is same for both approaches. SECTION V. Conclusion
    In this paper, we have presented a Group-Query-as-a-Service approach for dynamic
    spectrum access in geolocation-enabled database-driven opportunistic cognitive
    wireless networks. Secondary users form location-based grids and elect their grid
    leaders who query the geo-location database for idle channels and broadcast it
    to follower secondary users. As part of the eligibility criteria for grid leader
    election, we have considered a trust metric which is evaluated based on the trustworthiness
    of the secondary user as well as interaction time within the grid. Also, a contour
    of sensed data in the ROAR framework is formed based on geo-location and reported
    idle channels, to improve representation and visualization, as well as to aid
    group-based query. Due to the limited resources in wireless enabled devices and
    their perpetual mobility, this approach ensures that mobile secondary users have
    access to idle channel information obtained by a resourceful and trustworthy GLs.
    Our future work includes an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach using
    formal analysis and validate using more experiments and simulations. Furthermore,
    we plan to compare the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art work while
    evaluating the performance of the proposed approach. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The usage of wireless devices, such as
    vehicles, mobile phones, tablets, and various wireless sensors, has been rapidly
    increasing over the past decade [1]. This has promoted the development of fifth-generation
    (5G) wireless communication, which is currently being actively studied. In 5G
    wireless networks, the data rates are expected to be 10 times the present rates,
    and robust connectivity and 100% coverage are anticipated to provide a better
    quality of service and user experience [2]. Spectrum resources are limited, especially
    in real-world scenarios, since spectrum usage is regulated by the government due
    to security, safety and stability considerations [3]. Spectrum access is usually
    granted to licensed users, and unlicensed users are not allowed to transmit and
    receive data over ungranted regions of the spectrum. Thus, a contradiction arises
    between the limits on spectrum resources and the increasing number of users. Therefore,
    dynamic approaches to spectrum usage have been designed to improve the spectrum
    usage efficiency. Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is one such approach [4]. In a
    CRN, unauthorized users are allowed to communicate over licensed regions of the
    spectrum as long as that portion of the spectrum is not being used by authorized
    users. Studies have verified the feasibility of this method [5]. Cognitive radio
    is driving a revolution, moving away from fixed spectrum access and assignment.
    In the cognitive radio approach, “spectrum holes” are found through detection
    of the usage of spectrum resources by wireless communication devices. Then, spectrum
    sharing can be realized by tuning the transmitter power of cognitive users. Because
    cognitive users can control their transmitter power, interference among users
    often arises, especially when users are densely distributed in a cell or CRN.
    From the user perspective, a high transmission power will enlarge the communication
    range and ensure good Quality of Service (QoS). On the other hand, a high transmission
    power also leads to increased interference. To reach a good balance between QoS
    and mutual interference, many solutions have been designed for CRNs. Typically,
    the problem of resource allocation, including both power and spectrum allocation,
    is modeled as an optimization problem. The problem is then addressed based on
    optimization theory, convex optimization, relaxation and other techniques [6],
    [7]. Zhao et al. [8] constructed a power control model based on small cell base
    stations and used a sequential convex programming method to solve this problem.
    Resource allocation in CRNs has been widely studied [9]–[13]. Zhao et al. [14]
    used fractional frequency reuse technology to handle spectrum auctions in cognitive
    cellular systems. Spectrum assignment is usually modeled as a combinatorial optimization
    problem with binary variable. It has been reported that such problem is Non-deterministic
    Polynomial (NP)-hard problem, which are hard to solve due to high complexity [15],
    [16]. Generally, Lagrange multiplier theory, duality theory and graph theory are
    applied to solve resource allocation problems. Mathematical models of resource
    allocation in ad-hoc networks, CRNs and/or heterogeneous networks usually require
    combinatorial optimization. Such models involve integer variables which are non-differentiable,
    traditional non-linear programming methods requiring derivatives have difficulty
    in handling integer variables [17]. Recently, evolutionary algorithms has been
    introduced to solve resource allocation problems. He et al. presented a survey
    of bio-inspired approaches for CRNs, including ant colony optimization, differential
    evolution [18], particle swarm optimization [19], [20] and Artificial Bee Colony
    (ABC) [21]. Yousefvand et al. [22] built a spectrum allocation model based on
    an interference temperature condition and proposed a radix-tree-based algorithm
    for spectrum management. Jia et al. [23] used linear programming and a genetic
    algorithm to optimize cross-layer parameters in wireless mesh networks. Han et
    al. [24] studied relay placement and power allocation in cooperative relaying
    networks. Although many resource allocation solutions have been proposed, spectrum
    allocation in underlay CRNs is seldom studied. Therefore, this paper addresses
    spectrum allocation in underlay CRNs. The considered scenario includes ad-hoc
    transmission in a cellular network containing a number of primary and secondary
    users. Both interference between primary and secondary users and interference
    between secondary users are considered. An optimization model is formulated by
    maximizing the spectrum utilization of the allocation solution in a CRN. The problem
    is then solved by means of an improved artificial bee colony algorithm. In the
    Modified Binary ABC (MBABC) algorithm, binary variables of spectrum assignment
    are encoded as bit strings, and the initial bit strings are refined by binary
    variation operators. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the proposed
    allocation model and the MBABC algorithm. To benchmark the proposed method, Binary
    ABC (BABC) [25], Memetic ABC (MemABC) [21] and random method (RAND) are chosen
    for comparison. BABC was used for constructing spanning trees in ad-hoc networks.
    MemABC was used for the synthesis of an end effector. RAND refers to perform spectrum
    assignment in a random manner. It is often taken as a baseline for comparison.
    The simulation results are discussed and compared with BABC, MemABC and RAND methods.
    In the following, Section II presents the optimization model for spectrum allocation.
    Section III introduces the modified ABC algorithm. Section IV describes the numerical
    simulations, along with discussions and analysis. Section V concludes the paper.
    SECTION II. Optimization Model for Spectrum Allocation This section describes
    the CRN scenario discussed in the paper. In this scenario, secondary users (unauthorized
    users) are allowed to transmit or receive messages using spectrum resources assigned
    to primary users (authorized users). Secondary users may occupy channels assigned
    to primary users as long as those channels are not being used by the primary users
    or the resulting interference to the primary users is below a given interference
    temperature. According to a survey conducted by the Federal Communications Commission
    on licensed spectrum usage, a fixed spectrum assignment scheme, although it ensures
    good QoS, results in wastage of spectrum resources because the efficiency of such
    a fixed scheme is very low [26]. Hence, dynamic spectrum allocation is a sensible
    alternative. To fully explore the white space spectrum, an optimal allocation
    scheme is needed to ensure that both the spectrum efficiency and the QoS can be
    improved. Utilization and fairness are considered in spectrum assignment [26],
    though they focused on open spectrum systems. This section concentrates on spectrum
    allocation in underlay CRN scenario, which is more complicated than the case in
    [26]. Moreover, interference among the users is the main concern to model the
    problem. Consider a set of primary users located in a cellular network. A base
    station is the transmitter used by all primary users, and each primary user possesses
    a receiver. The network also contains a number of secondary users. Each secondary
    user has a transmitter and a receiver. Let P , S and M denote the number of primary
    users, the number of secondary users and the number of channels, respectively.
    The channels are assumed to be non-overlapping orthogonal. Changes in the network
    topology will occur due to the mobility of the primary users or the data transmission
    traffic. Hence, spectrum allocation must be completed as soon as possible. At
    present, the allocation time is quite low due to the high available computing
    power. Thus, it is assumed that the communication environment in the network will
    remain unchanged during the allocation optimization period. Let Rp denote the
    protection area for each primary user, meaning that they all have protection areas
    of the same size. Let Rs denote the range of the interference produced by secondary
    users. Fig. 1 presents an example of secondary users interfering with a primary
    user, where the solid square symbol denotes the receiver of the primary user;
    the solid and hollow circle symbols denote the transmitter and receiver, respectively,
    of a secondary user. It can be seen from the figure that the interference ranges
    of both Secondary User I (SU-I) and Secondary User II (SU-II) overlap with the
    protection area of Primary User I (PU-I). Generally, SU-I or SU-II have two ways
    to void mutual interference. First, they could adjust Rs to avoid interference
    when they transmit data through the same channel. In case mutual interference
    could not be avoided by adjusting Rs , the second way is resort to different channels.
    SU-I or SU-II could select a channel different from that of PI to avoid mutual
    interference. The dashed lines in Fig. 1 show the minimum Rs values at which SU-I
    and SU-II can operate. SU-I could shrink Rs sufficiently to eliminate the interference
    with PU-I. By contrast, the minimum range Rs of SU-II still overlaps with the
    Rp of PU-I; thus, SU-II may instead use a different channel from that of PU-I.
    Fig. 2 presents an example of interference among SU-I, SU-II and Secondary User
    III (SU-III), where the solid and hollow circle symbols denote transmitters and
    receivers, respectively, of secondary users. It can be seen from the figure that
    the receivers of SU-I and SU-III are distant from each other. Hence, mutual interference
    between them could be avoided through suitable tuning of their transmission power.
    By contrast, the receivers of SU-II and SU-III are very close to each other. In
    this case, they should use different channels to avoid mutual interference. Fig.
    1. Interference between primary and secondary users. Show All Fig. 2. Interference
    among secondary users. Show All In general, it is assumed that a secondary user
    s can occupy the same channel m as the nearest primary user p only if d(s,m)≤Dist(s,p)−d(p,m)
    , where d(s,m) denotes the transmission power of s on channel m , Dist(s,p) is
    the distance between s and p , and d(p,m)=Rp . The interference ranges Rs of the
    secondary users are assumed to lie in the interval [ d min , d max ] , which corresponds
    to the minimum and maximum transmission power levels for secondary users. First,
    let us define the matrix of channel availability, L={ l s,m } . L is an S -by-
    M matrix in which each element l s,m that is equal to 1 indicates that secondary
    user s can use channel m ; otherwise, the corresponding element is equal to 0.
    Thus, as described above, l s,m =1 if d(s,m)≤Dist(s,p)−d(p,m) and d min ≤d(s,m)≤
    d max . Let A={ a s,m } denote the channel assignment matrix. This matrix is of
    the same dimensions as L . a s,m =1 if channel m is assigned to secondary user
    s ; otherwise a s,m =0 . Note that the assignment must satisfy certain channel
    demand constraints. Let C={ c s,k,m } denote the constraints on the channel demands
    of the secondary users. c s,k,m =1 indicates that secondary user s and secondary
    user k would interfere with each other if both were to use channel m . The matrix
    C can be computed based on the Euclidean distances between the receiver locations
    of the secondary users. Thus, the following constraints for a s,m are built: a
    s,m + a k,m ≤ ∑ m=1 M a s,m ≤  { 1, 2, if  c s,k,m =1 otherwise,  C max , (1)
    (2) View Source where 1≤n , k≤S , and C max is the maximum number of channels
    that secondary user s could use. Furthermore, dynamic spectrum allocation should
    not strongly affect primary users on the same channel. Let G SP denote the channel
    gain matrix between secondary users on each channel. This matrix has dimensions
    of M by S by S . Let G SP denote the channel gain matrix between the transmitters
    of secondary users and the receivers of primary users on each channel. In an underlay
    CRN, secondary users can use the same channels as primary users as long as the
    resulting interference to primary users is no greater than an interference temperature
    (IT) threshold I T m p : ∑ s=1 S a s,m ∗ P s (m)∗ g SP (m)≤I T m p , (3) View
    Source where P s (m) denotes the transmission power of secondary user s on channel
    m and g SP (m) is the channel gain between a secondary user’s transmitter and
    a primary user’s receiver on channel m . Based on the Shannon capacity theorem,
    the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is assumed to be a function of the transmission
    power of secondary users on a channel. The following equation is used: r s,m =log(1+
    γ s,m ), (4) View Source where R s ={ r s,m } is a channel reward matrix denoting
    the rate gained by s on channel m and γ s,m is the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio due to secondary user s on channel m . Hence, the total channel reward of
    a given allocation solution is calculated as R S = ∑ s=1 S ∑ m=1 M r s,m ∗ a s,m
    . (5) View Source Clearly, the spectrum utilization of a CRN increases with the
    increase of the total channel reward summed over all secondary users on all channels.
    Finally, the optimization model of the spectrum assignment problem is expressed
    as follows: max  R S = ∑ s=1 S ∑ m=1 M r s,m ∗ a s,m s.t.  a s,m + a k,m ≤{ 1,
    2, if  c s,k,m =1 otherwise ∑ m=1 M a s,m ≤ C max ∑ s=1 S a s,m ∗ P s (m)∗ g SP
    (m)≤I T m p , (6) View Source where the elements of A={ a s,m } are binary variables.
    Solving optimization model (6) requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem.
    It is well known that such problems are NP hard. Some researchers have attempted
    to cope with such problems by means of graph theory [26] or game theory [27],
    [28]. As a necessary resource in base stations, the sum energy is maximized harvested
    by the energy harvesters [29]. The problem is then solved by relaxation to convexity
    and Lagrangian method. In heterogeneous cellular networks, overlapping of coverage
    areas results interference coordination. A distributed resource allocation algorithm
    is proposed to reduce the interference between macrocell base stations and low-power
    base stations [30]. Different from researches in [29] and [30], we aim to maximize
    network utilization by allocating channel resources, and we apply a modified ABC
    algorithm to solve the problem (6). The modified ABC method will be presented
    in the next section. SECTION III. Modified Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm The
    ABC algorithm belongs to the class of swarm intelligence algorithms. Since it
    was first proposed in 2005, it has been widely studied, both with regard to the
    algorithm structure [31] and for practical applications [25], [32]. These studies
    have shown that the ABC approach is an effective paradigm for combinatorial optimization
    and continuous optimization. Although much successful research has been reported
    over the past decade, the effectiveness of the ABC approach could still be improved
    through the appropriate choice of variation operators and a proper selection pressure.
    Moreover, suitable links between the characteristics of the algorithm and the
    problem to be solved are also important to achieve the best performance. The modified
    ABC algorithm adopted here is detailed as follows. As introduced in Section II,
    the matrix A contains S by M decision variables to be optimized. Because not every
    channel is available to each secondary user, the number of variables can be reduced
    based on the matrix L . For example, Fig. 3 shows a matrix L with S=3 and M=5
    . Clearly, seven of the elements of L are equal to 1, and the others are 0. Hence,
    this structure can be encoded as a vector of length 7 (shown as x in Fig. 3).
    The vector x can be transformed back into A based on a row-column rule, as shown
    in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the number of variables can be greatly reduced
    by removing those corresponding to unavailable channels. Fig. 3. Channel availability
    matrix L , spectrum assignment matrix A and encoding method. Show All Fig. 4 presents
    the main procedures of the proposed algorithm. The modified ABC algorithm is inspired
    by our previous work [25] and the selection pressure used in GAs. The first step
    is initialization, in which a number of initial solutions N s are generated via
    the encoding method for a given L . The fitness values of these solutions are
    evaluated based on optimization model (6). Fig. 4. Flow chart of the modified
    ABC algorithm. Show All The second step is the application of variations in operation.
    A pool of N s solutions is chosen from the current colony based on different selection
    pressure schemes. Uniform random selection means that each solution has an equal
    probability of being chosen. Roulette wheel selection means that fitter solutions
    have a higher probability of being chosen. Then, one-gene-flip mutation is used
    to mutate the selected solutions [33]. The idea of one-gene-flip mutation is that
    only one gene is mutated when mutation is needed. Standard ABC mutation is performed
    on one position of a solution [25]. The one-gene-flip mutation process is performed
    on binary variables. Hence, its effect is as follows: v ij ={ 1− x ij , x ij ,
    if j=j1 otherwise, (7) View Source where j1∈[1,D] is a randomly chosen mutation
    position, with D being the number of variables in x . Two-point crossover is then
    applied after the mutation operation. Two positions j2 and j3 between 1 and D
    are randomly chosen. Then, two new solutions are produced by swapping the chosen
    positions j2 and j3 . Note that to retain the effect of the mutation, position
    j1 is prevented from being selected to be swapped in the crossover operation.
    Greedy selection between x i and v i is performed based on their fitness, and
    the fitter solution is reserved for the next cycle. The selection pressure of
    greedy selection method is useful to balance exploration and exploitation of the
    optimization algorithm. It is the most popular selection method in swarm intelligence
    approaches. Thus, the modified ABC algorithm uses this selection method. Because
    mutation and crossover shed different effect on the algorithm, both operations
    are used in the second step to assure the efficacy of the resulting algorithm.
    The third step is the scout stage, which improves the global convergence. Scout
    stage is the imitation of the foraging behavior of scout bees. When a food source
    runs out of nectar, scout bees fly out searching for another food source. After
    evolving over many cycles, some solutions in the colony may lose their diversity,
    e.g., become trapped in local optima or a state of stagnation. If fitness improvement
    does not occur within a number of variations equal to limit , the related solutions
    are considered to have lost their diversity and are regenerated as follows: x
    kj ={ 1, 0, if  r j ≤0.5 otherwise ,j=1,2,…,D, (8) View Source where r j is a
    random number between 0 and 1. If the termination conditions have not been met,
    a new iteration of step 2 and step 3 is executed; otherwise, the algorithm terminates
    and outputs the optimal solution and related information. This modified ABC algorithm
    is designed to solve combinatorial problems; hence, the proposed algorithm is
    called the modified binary artificial bee colony (MBABC) algorithm. SECTION IV.
    Numerical Experiment This section presents a numerical experiment conducted to
    study the effectiveness of optimization model (6) and the MBABC algorithm in CRN
    systems. Because the spectrum allocation problem is expressed as a single optimization
    problem, the optimal solution obtained from the MBABC algorithm is taken as the
    allocation solution for the network. A. Simulation Scenario Consider an underlay
    CRN deployed in a square area with dimensions of 10 by 10, where all primary and
    secondary users are located within this area. It is assumed that the primary and
    secondary users are uniformly distributed throughout the area. The transmitter
    used by the primary users is a base station lying in the center of the area. Each
    primary user possesses a receiver. The transmitters used by the secondary users
    are then created throughout the area. The secondary users’ receivers are randomly
    created near their transmitters under the constraint that the distance must be
    covered by the transmitter. Moreover, the distance is also constrained by d min
    and d max . Table 1 gives the simulation parameters. To achieve good statistical
    performance, CRN deployments were independently simulated 100 times in accordance
    with the parameters in Table 1. That is 100 instances of spectrum assignment problem
    were created. TABLE 1 Parameters of the Simulated Cognitive Radio Network B. Simulation
    Results To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed optimization model (6) and
    the proposed MBABC algorithm, the BABC, MemABC and RAND algorithms were chosen
    as comparison methods. BABC encodes variables as binary strings and uses two-element
    variation technique. It shows good performance in solving spanning tree problems
    [25]. MemABC hybridizes ABC with random walk and uses ϵ -constraint scheme. It
    shows good performance in the control of the gripping force along the opening
    range of the calculated mechanisms. [21]. Moreover, RAND was chosen as a baseline
    for the comparison. This method randomly allocates resources in an iteration and
    records the best allocation as the result. Each method was independently run 25
    times to allow the average performance to be evaluated. In each run, the termination
    condition was set to 100,000 function evaluations. The parameters of the MBABC
    and BABC algorithms were set to N s =30 and limit=0.5∗ N s ∗D . For the crossover
    operation in the MBABC algorithm, the crossover rate was set to 1, meaning that
    the crossover operation was applied to every solution. For the RAND method, a
    colony of size N s was also used to ensure a fair comparison among the three methods.
    Spectrum usage efficiency could be obtained based on (4) for a network with one
    user. In the proposed optimization model (6), when R S grows bigger, spectrum
    usage efficiency also increases at the same time. Thus, the efficiency is approximated
    by averaging R S over all secondary users. Fig. 5 shows the spectrum usage efficiency
    for 100 instances. In this figure, the MBABC results are shown as the solid line,
    the BABC results are shown as the dashed line, the MemABC results are shown as
    the dotted line, and the RAND results are shown as the dash-dot line. It can be
    seen from the figure that the MBABC curve lies above those of BABC, MemABC and
    RAND, and the BABC curve lies above that of MemABC and RAND. This indicates that
    the RAND method cannot effectively improve the efficiency of the CRN. By contrast,
    the proposed MBABC method greatly improves the network utilization and thus the
    spectrum usage efficiency, as indicated by the very large differences with respect
    to the BABC and MemABC results. From these simulations of 100 instances, it is
    seen that the optimization model (6) enables efficient data transmission and good
    network utilization. Fig. 5. Spectrum usage efficiency for 100 CRN instances as
    found using the MBABC, BABC, MemABC and RAND methods. Show All Table 2 presents
    the results of the MBABC, BABC, MemABC and RAND algorithms. The Median (Med) and
    Standard deviation (Std) metrics are used to assess the performance of the four
    methods. This table presents the results for the first 20 instances; the results
    for the remaining 80 instances are not shown to save space. It can be seen from
    Table 2 that the Med values for the MBABC algorithm are greater than those for
    the BABC, MemABC and RAND methods. Moreover, the Std values for the proposed method
    are much lower than those for the BABC, MemABC and RAND methods. Thus, the proposed
    method is more effective than the other three methods. The MBABC algorithm is
    also more robust than the BABC, MemABC and RAND methods. Averaged over the 100
    instances, the MBABC algorithm shows an 8.94% improvement in spectrum usage efficiency
    compared with the BABC algorithm, a 14.31% improvement compared with the MemABC
    method, and a 37.02% improvement compared with the RAND method. Therefore, the
    proposed method is suitable for solving spectrum allocation problems in CRNs.
    TABLE 2 Comparison of the MBABC, BABC, MemABC and RAND Methods on 20 Cognitive
    Radio Network Instances C. Impact of the Colony Size The proposed MBABC algorithm
    has two parameters, N s and limit . limit is defined based on N s and D ; it is
    a default setting and has shown good performance in an extensive numerical study
    [25]. Hence, N s is the only parameter that needs to be discussed. In general,
    the value of N s is set to an integer between 15 and 50. Hence, five values were
    tested here: N s ∈{10,20,30,40,50} . The results are shown in Fig. 6. This figure
    shows the mean value of the best utilizations over 100 instances as found by the
    MBABC algorithm with each of the five different N s values. Clearly, the algorithm
    performs worse with N s =10 or N s =20 than it does with N s =30 , 40 or 50. Moreover,
    the MBABC algorithm achieves essentially the same value with N s =30 , 40 or 50.
    Thus, a colony size between 30 and 50 is recommended based on Fig. 6. Fig. 6.
    Mean of the best spectrum usage efficiency over 100 CRN instances as found by
    the MBABC algorithm with different colony sizes. Show All Fig. 6 shows the results
    of the MBABC method with different colony sizes. In addition, let us discuss and
    analyze the convergence process on individual instances. For simplicity, we take
    the first deployment instance as an example; the others are not shown because
    they exhibit similar behavior. The convergence graphs of the MBABC algorithm with
    the five colony sizes are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that among the five
    curves, the MBABC algorithm with N s =30 (the graph with star symbols) converges
    the fastest when the number of Function Evaluations (FEs) is greater than 2000.
    The algorithm with N s =50 converges the second fastest when FEs is greater than
    10,000. The curve corresponding to N s =40 lags behind the other four until FEs
    = 50,000. The main reason is that it starts at the worst initial solution (the
    lowest point at FEs=1000 in Fig. 7). By contrast, although the curves corresponding
    to N s =10 and 20 have good initial solutions, they converge more slowly than
    the N s =30 curve. Thus, based on this analysis of the convergence process, N
    s =30 is the suggested setting for the MBABC method. Fig. 7. Convergence graphs
    of the MBABC method with different colony sizes on the same instance. Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusion Spectrum resources are limited in real-world applications,
    and dynamic spectrum allocation mechanisms are in high demand because of the high
    QoS requirements of 5G wireless communication. Consequently, cognitive radio is
    driving a revolution, moving away from fixed spectrum access and assignment. Typically,
    the allocation of resources, including both power and spectrum resources, is modeled
    as an optimization problem. This paper proposes a spectrum allocation model based
    on the interference among primary and secondary users. An optimization model is
    formulated that maximizes the spectrum utilization of the allocation solution
    for a CRN. The problem is then solved using an improved artificial bee colony
    algorithm called the MBABC algorithm. In the MBABC algorithm, each possible spectrum
    assignment solution is encoded as a bit string. A solution pool is chosen based
    on different selection pressure schemes. Mutation and crossover operations are
    then applied to produce new solutions. Through a series of evolution cycles, a
    good allocation solution can be reached. Numerical experiments conducted to analyze
    the proposed allocation model and the MBABC algorithm are presented. The simulation
    results are also discussed and compared with the results of the BABC, MemABC and
    RAND methods. First, efficient data transmission and QoS can be achieved by using
    the proposed allocation model. Second, the MBABC method finds better allocation
    solutions than the BABC, MemABC and RAND methods do. Third, the parameter N s
    of the MBABC algorithm may affect its performance. Based on the results of a simulation
    study, N s =30 is the suggested setting for the MBABC method. Under this setting,
    the required number of function evaluations can be reduced to 10,000, enabling
    a considerable savings in computation time, which is useful in real-world applications.

    USA SECTION I. Introduction In any operation, whether civilian or military, information
    sharing is essential, and nowadays, the most common methods of communication are
    wireless. In order to operate properly, wireless systems require a frequency allocation
    plan to minimize interferences. Taking in consideration a number of different
    radio systems which are set up and working in a typical mission, the traditional
    approach of spectrum allocation (pre-assigned frequencies) is not efficient. During
    rapid deployment missions or rescue operations, the traditional methodology for
    the usage of spectrum, based on fixed assignments, imposes severe limitations.
    In many cases the critical telecommunications infrastructure is partly damaged
    and local administration does not function, so the information about the spectrum
    allocation and its usage is not available. In such situations, the radio network
    planners have to meet a lot of challenges to establish the communications without
    interferences. The solution is to use a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) by cognitive
    radio. CR is an implementation of the DSA idea and is able to collect sufficient
    information about the operational spectrum environment, and use this information
    to adjust its behaviour in accordance to the environment. This feature of CR allows
    to avoid interference in a crowded spectrum. Typically CR looks for any unoccupied
    bands (white spaces) of the spectrum and uses one of them as the alternative to
    ensure information exchange when interference occurs [1] [2]. Information provided
    by CR about the operational spectrum environment can be used either in the planning
    process of the new radio network or to improve performance of the existing radio
    network by fitting the radios behaviour to the actual environment of the radio
    spectrum. Therefore the awareness of this environment is very important in military
    missions, as it gives an overview of the frequency bands usage in a given time
    and location, and it is crucial for the operation success. Sensing is the key
    feature of CR, providing the information about the used frequency bands, transmitter
    locations and characteristics of radio propagation. Sensing can be performed using
    several techniques; energy detection, matched filtering based detection, cyclostationarity-based
    detection, covariance based detection, multitaper spectrum sensing and estimation
    are the most popular and they are well described in the literature[3] [4]. In
    order to minimize the risk of miscalculations concerning primary user presence,
    the detection process can be organised in several ways. The centralized (external)
    detection, distributed detection and cluster based detection methods are amongst
    the most popular in cooperative and collaborative approaches. In this paper we
    describe cooperative cluster based detection using the energy detecting sensing
    method. We assume that the primary users are present and jammers are operating
    in the primary users'' bands, which forces CRs to change the frequency channels
    to ensure the exchange of information. This paper proposes a solution for the
    issue in which the same alternative frequencies are used by neighbouring cluster
    heads (CH) in a MANET radio network consisting of a number of clusters. To assess
    capability of the radio network we propose to use operational criteria. The structure
    of this paper is as follows: in Section 2, we present the operational scenario,
    sensing results, spectrum awareness and we define the research problem. Then we
    discuss the operational assessment. Next, in Section 4, we describe the simulator,
    and finally we show the results in Section 5. In Section 6 a channel selection
    mechanism for CH is described, and conclusions are presented in Section 7. SECTION
    II. Spectrum Awareness Wireless technology is one of the most common ways to ensure
    transmission of information for both civilian and military communication and IT
    systems. Amongst other available technologies, MANET is one of the most promising
    solutions for military purposes because it ensures communication without terrestrial
    infrastructure, as it is a self-organising mechanism with a dynamic network topology.
    This ad hoc topology may change in time, as the nodes move and assess their transmission
    parameters. The self-organising mechanism can be implemented in many ways, and
    its selection depends on the type of the waveform. For our simulations we used
    a CORASMA simulator [11]. The CORASMA MANET model consists of radio nodes, the
    Radio Environment Model (REMO) and external sources of interferences. During operation,
    the radio nodes constantly exchange control information to select the best radios
    for specific roles in the hierarchical radio network [12] [13]. First of all,
    some radio nodes are elected as local controllers, i.e. cluster heads (CH). Secondly,
    CHs handle the assignment of frequency bands for particular clusters (colouring)
    [14]. If required, the radio nodes are also selected to act as gateways (GW) between
    clusters. The rest of the radio nodes of the network are called regular nodes
    (RN). If operational conditions of a specific CH degrade, its role can be taken
    over by another radio node of the network, so the structure can adapt. CHs control
    the sensing in their own clusters and receive the results of sensing from own
    RNs. Each CH creates a CRL from gathered spectrum usage information, which will
    be used in case of interference. CH performs DSA using information collected during
    sensing, based on CRL [15]. In practice, CRL is a recognized “picture” of a frequency
    spectrum, as CHs evaluate whether given frequency bands are occupied or not. The
    information about used and unoccupied bands gives spectrum awareness in the cluster
    of the radio network. CHs mark any empty frequency band as potentially ready to
    use. Due to the fact that we deal with cooperative cluster detection, CH in any
    specific cluster do not know whether the other CHs prepared their own CRLs [16]
    [17]. It means that each CH knows only its own CRL and is not aware of CRLs other
    CHs. If many CHs select the same band as an alternative one, it could happen that
    when interference occurs, several CHs could switch to the same alternative channel.
    This would negatively impact CR network capability. Examples of CRLs are provided
    in Fig. 1. Red colour indicates interference; blue indicates the currently used
    channel; green colours indicate the best alternative channels, whereas the darker-coloured
    channels ale worse. In these figures you can see that nodes are changing their
    channel during the simulation and they change the alternative channels too. Fig.
    1 Spectrum awareness in ch (node nr 1) Show All The results presented in the drawings
    show that cognitive algorithm and sensing are able to derive information needed
    to classify channels in a CRL. This process gives the spectrum awareness in the
    cluster. There is a risk of an instability in the radio network if the neighbouring
    clusters decide to switch to an alternative frequency at the same time. If one
    CH takes a given band, any subsequent CH, which previously intended to use the
    same band now needs time to organize new frequencies (channels) in order to restore
    connectivity both in the cluster and in the network. Fig. 2 presents the case
    when two CH (8 and 20) have the same alternative channel, which was caused by
    their close proximity and similar sensing results during simulation (operation).
    Such situations will probably provoke a conflict between CHs. Fig. 2 Crl similarities
    in neighbouring chs 8 and 20 Show All SECTION III. Operational Evaluation MANET
    networks were considered in the WOLF project, which aimed to develop a robust
    communications link for operations in an urban environment [18]. During the project,
    research was performed concerning the importance of the various services at the
    lowest levels of the command chain. The researchers conducted interviews with
    soldiers, and upon compiling answers, identified a number of mission threads,
    as well as critical and useful services. According to the results of the research
    the voice service is the most crucial at the lowest levels of the command (from
    troop up to company levels). The real-time (RT) operational data exchange is the
    second important service (e.g. positioning, tracks and warnings). The NRT services
    were indicated as an additional way of information exchange, which is needed at
    the company level and below. These services ensure exchange of orders, reports,
    battlefield geometries, formatted text messages, information about facilities,
    logistics data, etc. The research has also shown that transmission of full or
    slow motion video coming from individual sensors or from UAV/UGV is the new capability
    introduced widely on those levels. In addition to research, military exercises
    provide the necessary information and experience. The Combined Endeavour was one
    of the largest exercises, focused on the interoperability testing of military
    telecommunications systems. During this event an operational scenario was a part
    of the evaluation of the coalition network. The exercise concerned operation threads
    from battalion level up to Join Task Force Command. The experiences and lessons
    learned were firstly converted to the Tactic Techniques and Procedure, and rebuilt
    to Joining Membership and Exit Instructions (JMEI). Information Exchange Requirements
    (IER) were prepared during the planning process for each level of command. Next,
    services were selected for the command and control (C2) system in the mission
    to fulfil the set of the requirements. The network services chosen for C2 system
    were assigned per the communication plan: primary method - commonly used for C2
    activities, alternative method - used if main service is not operational, contingency
    method - used in cases when both primary and alternative means is not operational,
    emergency method - a last resort mean to keep C2. Each method was related to the
    certain service which was set up and was running in the coalition network [19].
    To verify whether the IER are fulfilled, it is necessary to have a tool to evaluate
    the radio network capability. The command capability is ensured by several services
    and depends on the used technology [20]. This fact must be taken in consideration
    in the network evaluation process for the operational use. We propose to use a
    command capability factor (C2F) to evaluate the network performance for an operational
    purpose. C2F is a normalised coefficient proportional to difference between available
    bandwidth among investigated nodes and required bandwidth for command services.
    Because each service has its own role at the specific level of command, a weight
    of the service factor (w) is proposed to emphasize its importance. C2F= Tr−P∗
    Σ n k=1 w l k T a k Tr View Source where: P-service use probability distribution
    Ik- number of users w-weight of the services Ta - throughput available in a wide
    area network Tr- throughput requested for command control services. If C2F is
    equal or higher the 0 the services can be used in an operation for a C2 purpose.
    If C2F is lower than 0, the services taken for command are not suitable for operational
    use. As the value of C2F approaches 1, the better the conditions are for services
    in a network. The throughput needed for command services is calculated based on
    technical parameters of the service or consider the information exchange requirements.
    The bandwidth available in the network is the maximum transmission capability
    in the wide area network. The C2F factor is independent from the type of transmission
    medium and could be used to evaluate any network. The model of the CR network
    supports command control processes by giving access to voice, automated C2, blue
    force tracking and e-mail services. Table 1 presents the weights of the services
    used for the calculation of the C2F. Table 1. Weights of the services used to
    calculate C2F SECTION IV. Simulation Description The research results achieved
    in the projects WOLF and CORASMA together with experiences coming from the Combined
    Endeavour exercise were used to build a simulations scenario, in which the CORASMA
    model of the MANET CR network was used to investigate the effects of two CHs selecting
    the same frequency band as their alternatives. The operational usage of the radio
    network was investigated for a stabilization mission scenario, with military forces
    operating from two military bases. The first one was the battalion HQ (mission
    HQ) while the second one was the company tactical operational centre (Coy HQ).
    All typical elements for this type of the mission like sentries, check points,
    patrols, convoys, were simulated. There were 20 nodes acting as the different
    elements of the battle order. In addition, a number jammers were implemented in
    the scenario to enforce the change of the communications channels by the CRs.
    The simulation was performed in the CORASMA simulator, and locations of the CR
    nodes are presented in Fig. 3. The scenario was prepared for the battalion level
    and below, so the services considered were appropriate to this level of command.
    The simulation contained the following services: voice (VolP), positioning data
    (BFT), orders and reports (C2 system) and e-mail (protocols POP and SMTP). The
    simulation time was divided into two parts. The first part of the simulation was
    used to evaluate the voice service - UDP traffic, while the second part focused
    on the assessment of the C2 and e-mail services based on the TCP protocol. BFT
    traffic was generated through all time of the simulation. The goal of the simulation
    was to check how the same frequency band selected as the alternative channel by
    several CHs affects the CR network capability. The CR network was simulated with
    the different environment of the radio spectrums (the number of channels). The
    changes concerned scarcity of the channels. The operational assessments were performed
    for each case created after the change introduced in the environment of the radio
    spectrum. Fig. 3 The cr nodes location in the scenario Show All During the simulation
    we considered several cases. The first case (when the number of the channels was
    15) gave low possibilities to choose the same frequency band as the alternative
    channel in case of interference. The second one, where the number of the channels
    were lower (8 and 6), were the cases when the probability to choose the same channel
    as a spare one was quite high. Selection of the cluster heads in the CR network
    was performed by dynamic clustering mechanism prepared in MUT [15]. The Table
    2 shows the simulated cases. Table 2. The simulation cases Simulation results
    for different cases were compared with a reference value to evaluate the influence
    of the use of the same frequencies by the neighbouring CH in the radio network.
    The reference value is the capability of the radio network without interference,
    with a big number of available channels (cases 104a, 105a). Then we switched the
    jammers on and the radio network capability was measured again (cases 101a, 107a).
    The next step was based on scarcity of the channels to provoke the usage of the
    same alternative channel by the neighbouring CH (cases 102a, 103a, 109a). There
    were two types of interference in the scenario. First of all there were narrowband
    users (Tetra radios and PNRs) which used the same band together with the CR network.
    Secondly there was a wideband jammer, which changed its working frequency every
    10s. SECTION V. Simulation Results The simulation results confirmed that implementation
    of DSA was working properly, as CHs built CRLs and changed channels in case of
    interference (Fig. 1). Furthermore, transmission capacities were also different.
    Although the CR network services were defined for all spectrum cases, the received
    results showed that in some cases no services were available for operational use
    - see Table 3. It was also difficult to observe that CHs selected the same frequency
    band as the alternative channel. The results show that in an environment with
    a scarcity of frequency bands and with interferences, the same channel marked
    as the alternative one in neighbouring clusters negatively influenced the capacity
    of the radio network and reduced the command capability. Table 3. The command
    capability factor computed for cases The results marked green are the cases that
    services could be used for operational use. The red spots show the cases that
    the services were not for operational use or it was impossible to calculate C2F
    because any statistic was collected during simulation. The grey colours presents
    the cases that the service was not implemented. Fig. 4 represents the voice traffic
    received at node #1 (TOC bn) in case 104a, with 15 channels available and without
    jammers, while the Fig. 5 represents the voice traffic received at the node #1
    in case 102a, in a channel-scarce environment with active jammers. We can see
    influence of the network capability on the voice service. Fig. 6 represent C2
    traffic received at node #1 (TOC bn) in case 104a - the test of the reference.
    There is no figure for case 102a (the worst case), because traffic was not collected
    at all. In the worst case the radio network was not operational for almost 77
    s (7, 7% time of the simulation). Fig. 4 Voice traffic received at node no 1 -
    case 104a Show All Fig. 5 Voice traffic received at node no 1 - case 102a Show
    All Fig. 6 C2 traffic received at node no 1 - case 104a Show All Fig. 7 Percentage
    presentation of successful sessions by traffic type Show All Fig. 7 represents
    interferences and their influence on network capability. The number of successful
    sessions decreases in comparison to the reference case (104a). SECTION VI. Interference
    Avoidance Mechanism The conducted simulatition confirmed that the same alternative
    channels selected by neighbouring CHs can cause decreasing of the radio network
    performance, however, CR is capable to cope with such cases very quickly. Because
    we deal with slow jammers in the simulation furthermore the number of jammer was
    not big CR cope with this very well. Based on simulation results for realistic
    scenario, we propose to set up some coordination (management) point (node). The
    main role of the management node (MN) would be to collect and analyse all CRLs
    set up in the radio network. MN is elected between CH and receives CRL and locations
    from specific CHs. Then MN checks if there is a possibility whether a CH would
    switch to the same channel as a neighbouring one in case of the interference.
    If several radio nodes plan to switch to the same frequency, and if they are located
    not far away from each other, the MN sends down an alert and recommends an alternative
    channel. MN is the good point to introduce to the radio network policies, e.g.
    a sensing policy, QoS policy, spectrum access policy. Fig. 8 shows the idea of
    the concept. Fig. 8 Crls management point concept for tactical network Show All
    Because we describe tactical radio networks, one main and one alternative MN are
    proposed. To prepare for a large-scale operation, several subnetwork management
    points and one central network management point should be created. This configuration
    is presented in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 Crls management point concept for enterprise network
    Show All SECTION VII. Conclusions This paper presents a novel approach of the
    operational evaluation of the chosen services for the command purpose. The simulation
    results shows that in the MANET network, which consists of clusters operating
    in neighbouring channels, it is possible that that the adjacent CHs can pick the
    same alternative channel in case of interference. According to the results, the
    network capability decreased by 93% for C2 service, by 46% for B FT service and
    by 33% for voice service in the worst case with interferences (6 channels with
    interferences). It is therefore possible that the CR network could become useless
    for C2 purposes during an operation. We use C2F to show the influence of the interferences
    on network performance. C2F an efficient indicator of network capability and it
    is suitable for a comparison of the networks which support different numbers of
    services. Due to the fact that CHs shared the information about used channel the
    cases 101a (15 channels without interferences) and 104a (15 channels with interferences)
    could be used to support the mission because C2F values were respectively 0.16
    and 0.27. In the simulation, MN was implemented and CRLs were used for monitoring
    purposes. Using this method it is possible to create spectrum awareness and find
    conflicts in alternative channels in CRLs. CHs shared information about used channels.
    The further course of the research will focus on the implementation of the mechanism
    and evaluation of the bandwidth consumption for communication between CHs and
    MN. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This An Average

    Overlay Network with Non-orthogonal Multiple Access and Energy Harvesting: Performance
    Evaluation Article 07 March 2024 1 Introduction With the rapid development of
    wireless communication technology and fast growth for spectrum demand, spectrum
    resources become increasingly scarce and one of the bottlenecks, restricting the
    development of wireless communications [1, 2]. Prior studies show that the fixed
    spectrum allocation policies result in poor spectrum utilization around 15 % [3,
    4]. There are two main reasons for the poor spectrum utilization: i) Spectrum
    is a limited resource and fixed spectrum policies will naturally lead to scarce
    spectrum. ii) Licensed spectrum is used very sporadically [1, 3, 4]. Realizing
    the poor spectrum efficiency of conventional fixed spectrum allocation policies,
    cognitive radio (CR) is proposed to improve the spectrum utilization [5–7], which
    alleviates the contradiction between the lack of spectrum resources and the growing
    demand for wireless access by enabling secondary users (SUs) to intelligently
    search and utilize the unused spectrum holes in licensed spectrum and thereby
    increasing the spectrum efficiency [8–10]. CR is also one of the dominant candidate
    technologies for the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication technologies
    [11, 12]. 5G systems are envisioned to integrate conventional licensed cellular
    radio and intelligent dynamic radio into a holistic system, realizing the CR concepts
    [9, 13, 14]. Unlike traditional radios, CR may change its objectives as radio
    scenarios vary, which provides a feasible scheme for SUs efficiently using the
    licensed spectrum in dynamic environment [10, 15]. The benefit of CR will depend
    on the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) schemes, which can provide a feasible solution
    for SUs to use the licensed spectrum in a dynamic environment efficiently. This
    requires SUs to detect spectrum holes across three domains; time, space, and frequency
    [16, 17]. Achieving DSA in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) requires addressing
    various issues in spectrum access behavior, spectrum sharing mode, and spectrum
    access mode, which has been well studied in [18–20]. Most of the prior works are
    devoted to performance analysis of DSA in CRNs [21]; game theory, auction, graph
    coloring, and mathematical programming are employed to optimize the performance
    of underlying spectrum access strategy [22, 23]. The urge to adapt to the dynamic
    environments and challenges associated with providing network-wide information
    makes centralized approaches less attractive [22]. That calls for tractable approaches
    to accommodate for distributed nature of CRNs. Game theory has been recognized
    as an interesting tool to model and analyze the cognitive behaviors in CRNs. Specifically,
    the distributed nature and both cooperative and non-cooperative DSA behaviors
    can well be captured by game theory [24, 25]. In order to assess spectrum access
    in CR environments, one-shot, non-cooperative games based on continuous and discrete
    reformulations of the Cournot game model was explored in [26], which reveals equilibrium
    situations that may be reached in simultaneous access scenarios of two and three
    users. A collision-constrained network selection (CCNS) method was proposed based
    on Markov queuing mode in [27], which maximizes allowable arrival rate of SUs
    subject to a target collision probability for the primary users (PUs). In the
    work, SUs select the shortest time delay to access network through the analysis
    of the SUs waiting transmission delay. In [28], a cooperative asynchronous multi-channel
    spectrum access MAC protocol was proposed, which uses a single transceiver and
    is fully asynchronous. However, it does not consider control frame constraints.
    In [23], simulation study based on M/G/1 queuing model was explored to evaluate
    the performance of PUs without closed attention to specifics of primary users
    and licensed channels. An intervention framework was proposed in [29], which protects
    the spectrum owner’s interests and enforces market regulations. In the framework,
    secondary networks offer offload services to a primary network (PN) in exchange
    for temporary access to the PN’s spectrum. To allocate unused frequency bands
    efficiently, two non-cooperative games named interference minimization game and
    capacity maximization game were proposed [30], which reflect the target of data
    radios and voice radios, respectively. The problem of spectrum pricing in a CRN
    is explored in [31], which formulates it as an oligopoly market consisting of
    a few firms and a consumer. A market equilibrium was explored in multichannel
    sharing CRNs [32]: it is assumed that every subchannel is orthogonally licensed
    to a single primary user (PU), and can be shared with multiple secondary users
    (SUs). A distributed and coordinated radio resource allocation algorithm was proposed
    for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based cellular networks
    to self-organize efficient and stable frequency reuse patterns [33], which can
    mitigate interference in self-organizing LTE networks. A simple self-organization
    rule was proposed based on minimizing cell transmit power [34], following which
    a distributed cellular network is able to converge into an efficient resource
    reuse pattern, which can mitigate interference in OFDMA femtocell networks. A
    market-clearing model was proposed for spectrum trade in CRNs [35]. A general
    soft decision SMSE (SDSMSE) framework was proposed [36], which extends the original
    SMSE framework to achieve synergistic CR benefits of overlay and underlay techniques.
    The prior work mainly considers the SUs interference to the PUs and not the mutual
    interference among SUs. SUs could potentially interfere with each other in attempt
    to simultaneously access the channel in CRNs. In this work, we propose a spectrum
    access algorithm based on game theory, which overcomes the problem of mutual interference
    among SUs. We have modeled the spectrum access problem as an oligopolistic competition
    model in game theory. We have performed an intensive analysis to characterize
    the SUs’ spectrum utilization behavior with respect to various criteria of the
    proposed game theoretic model. In particular we have carefully studied the existing
    of Nash equilibrium, the game process, the convergence of SUs, the total spectrum
    amount rented by SUs, and SU’s revenue. The remainder of this paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 illustrates the proposed DSA algorithm. In Section 3, our
    intensive simulation study validates the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Section
    4 concludes the paper. 2 The proposed DSA algorithm With intelligent sensing to
    obtain available spectrum information, CRNs can monitor spectrum environment and
    adjust system parameters effectively. In this section, a general model of DSA
    is presented based on game theory in CRNs; then the system model of SUs dynamic
    access is explored. The DSA algorithm based game theory is analyzed and secondary
    user’s utility function is given. And the Nash equilibrium solution of the proposed
    algorithm is deduced by maximizing the utility of SUs, and obtaining spectrum
    bandwidth rented by all SUs. And the notations of the proposed algorithm are shown
    in Table 1. Table 1 Notations Full size table 2.1 System model The DSA system
    in CRNs consists of three parts: PUs, SUs, and spectrum pool. In this paper, we
    only consider the game process among SUs. And the system model is shown in Fig.
    1. Fig. 1 System model Full size image Considering there are N game players, the
    strategic space of the players is S 1, ⋯, S N , the utility function is μ 1, ⋯, μ
    N . Therefore, a general model of game theory can be expressed as: $$ G=\\left\\{N,{\\displaystyle
    {S}_1},\\cdots, {\\displaystyle {S}_N};{\\displaystyle {\\mu}_1},\\cdots, {\\displaystyle
    {\\mu}_N}\\right\\}, $$ (1) where the strategic space for each game player i is
    S i , si is strategy and s i  ∈ S i , {s 1, ⋯, s N } is the strategy combination
    for all players. The utility function of each game player i is μ i , and μ i (S)
    represents the utility of game player i choosing strategic component {s 1, ⋯, s
    N }. The general game model satisfies three basic elements: 1) the number N of
    game players; 2) strategy space S i of each player i; 3) the strategic combination
    {s 1, ⋯, s N }, and the utility μ i (S) of each game player i. PUs include a base
    station and some users. Spectrum pool will accomplish centralized distribution
    of available spectrum within a specific area or location, adjust the process of
    spectrum sharing between communication devices, and monitor the server of the
    relevant spectrum. Spectrum rented by SUs can be used for communication between
    SU and PU, SU and access point, and can also be used for ad hoc network of SUs.
    The system workflow is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Workflow of the system Full size
    image The system works as follows: 1) In order to rent spectrum, PUs establishes
    the connection to spectrum pool and send their request information including idle
    spectrum and the utility function. 2) Spectrum pool will broadcast rental spectrum
    request information and rules to all SUs with the same price, and the price will
    change along with the market supply and demand. 3) Different SUs rent a certain
    spectrum bandwidth, and observe the market supply and demand, then adjust their
    rental spectrum bandwidth to achieve maximum benefit. 4) Spectrum pool determines
    whether game among the SUs reaches a steady state, namely whether the amount of
    rental spectrum bandwidth on the market and spectrum bandwidth that all SUs rent
    are stable. If the game does not reach steady state, all SUs continue to wait
    for the end of the game. If the steady state is reached, then the game will stop
    and the selected SU rents corresponding spectrum. 5) The SUs establish communication
    connection to the PUs, and then decide to loan spectrum to the PUs, in accordance
    with spectrum price of the market stability when the game among the SUs reaches
    a steady state. 6) The SU uses the spectrum of PUs for packets transmission, and
    then will return spectrum to the PUs after task ending. In 4), spectrum pool judges
    whether the game reaches steady state by observing whether game results are the
    same three times in a row. If game results of three times are the same, it shows
    that game is in stable equilibrium, and all SUs do not need to make decisions
    to carry out the game. Spectrum access in CRNs is related to the selected strategies
    of SUs in game. Spectrum access game includes game process among SUs, game process
    among PUs and the united game process between PUs and SUs. In the game among SUs,
    the participants are SUs, and action strategy is selected to loan spectrum bandwidth.
    The decision-making process is that SUs select corresponding spectrum bandwidth
    for data transmission. While in the game among PUs, participants are the PUs with
    licensed spectrum, and action strategy is to select the number of rental spectrum.
    The decision-making process is to determine the number of PUs selecting spectrum
    on loan to SUs. For the united game process between PUs and SUs, the participants
    are PUs and SUs, where action strategy of the PUs is to select the number of rental
    spectrum, and the action strategy of the SUs is to select loan spectrum bandwidth.
    The decision-making process of the PUs is to determine the number of rental spectrum,
    and the decision-making process of the SU is to decide leasing spectrum bandwidth.
    In order to depict the spectrum competition accurately, the DSA problem is modeled
    as an oligopolistic competition using Stackelberg model, which aims to improve
    spectrum bandwidth that the SUs loan, while improving the spectrum utilization
    of the PUs. When game is stable, the utility of SUs reaches the maximum, thus
    the enthusiasm of leased spectrum is highest. And then SUs will communicate with
    other ends by the leased spectrum, which improves the spectrum utilization of
    idle licensed spectrum efficiently. 2.2 Stackelberg game algorithm In the Stackelberg
    game algorithm, all SUs rent the same quality spectrum, and the same price fluctuates
    with the market demand. The behavior of SU is selfish and uncooperative, and it
    carries out the game among the SUs according to the loaned spectrum bandwidth.
    Due to some factors, such as the different network delay between each SU and spectrum
    pool server, all SUs do not take loan strategy simultaneously. According to Stackelberg
    game model, all participants will be separated into two groups. And a group of
    SUs take the strategy firstly, which will be the leaders in the game. And then
    the other group of SUs will take suitable game strategy according to the prior
    SU’s strategy, which will be the followers. According to the historical strategy,
    SUs will optimize their behaviors and select the most suitable strategy to gain
    more benefits. After some rounds of repeated game, the spectrum bandwidth leased
    by SUs will reach Nash equilibrium. The goal of the game algorithm is to maximize
    the spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs, while the goal of the proposed solution
    is to maximize the utility of the SUs. Hence, the following analysis will consider
    the utility of SUs. We can get the utility function u s (b i ) of SUi with the
    benefit of bandwidth b i for data transmission: $$ {\\displaystyle {u}_s}\\left({\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}\\right)={\\displaystyle {k}_i^{(s)}}{\\displaystyle {b}_i}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left({\\displaystyle
    {{\\displaystyle {Nb}_i}}^2}+2\\nu {\\displaystyle {b}_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j\\ne
    i}^N{\\displaystyle {b}_j}}\\right)-{\\displaystyle {pb}_i}, $$ (2) where ν is
    spectrum alternative factor, which means the size of the bandwidth requested by
    SUi is affected by other SUs. When ν = 0, SUi is not affected by other SUs; when
    ν = 1, other SUs have maximum influence on SUi. We only consider the utility of
    the SUs when ν = 0, and therefore according to Eq. (2), we can obtain the utility
    function u s (b i ) of the SUs: $$ {\\displaystyle {u}_s}\\left({\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}\\right)={\\displaystyle {k}_i^{(s)}}{\\displaystyle {b}_i}-\\frac{1}{2}{\\displaystyle
    {{\\displaystyle {Nb}_i}}^2}-{\\displaystyle {pb}_i}. $$ (3) To maximize the utility
    of the PUs, the utility of the PUs can be set as a function of bandwidth price,
    therefore, the total utility function u p (B) of the PUs is: $$ {\\displaystyle
    {u}_p}(B)={\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^N{\\displaystyle {pb}_i}}-{\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^NC(B)}, $$ (4) where p is the spectrum price that SUs pay to the PUs,
    b i is the spectrum bandwidth that the SUs loan, and C(B) is rental costs of the
    PUs. Rental costs are defined as follows: $$ C(B)=x+y{\\left({\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^N{\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}}\\right)}^{\\tau }, $$ (5) where x, y, τ are non-negative constant, τ ≥ 1
    (ensure the pricing function is a convex function). In order to obtain k (s) i
    , the SUs adopt adaptive modulation technology, and the transmission rate can
    dynamically adjust according to the channel quality. By adopting multiple quadrature
    amplitude modulations (MQAM), bit error rate (BER) single-input single-output
    Gaussian noise channel can be approximated expressed as: $$ BER\\approx 0.2 \\exp
    \\left(-1.5\\gamma /\\left({2}^k-1\\right)\\right), $$ (6) where γ is receiver
    signal-to-noise ratio, k is the transmission efficiency, namely k (s) i in expression
    (2). θ BER is the threshold of BER, and then the transmission efficiency can be
    formulated as: $$ k={\\displaystyle { \\log}_2}\\left(1+K\\gamma \\right), $$
    (7) where K is: $$ K=\\frac{1.5}{ \\ln \\left(0.2/{\\theta}_{BER}\\right)}. $$
    (8) According to Eqs. (6), (7) and (8), we can obtain: $$ {\\displaystyle {k}_i^{(s)}}={\\displaystyle
    { \\log}_2}\\left(1+\\frac{1.5}{ \\ln \\left(0.2/{\\theta}_{BER}\\right)}\\gamma
    \\right). $$ (9) The deduction of the utility function of PUs is with respect
    to spectrum bandwidth, which can maximize utility. At the same time, we can get
    the relationship between spectrum price and spectrum bandwidth: $$ {\\displaystyle
    {u}_p}(B)={\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{N}}{\\displaystyle {pb}_i}}-{\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^NC(B)}, $$ (10) $$ \\frac{\\partial {\\displaystyle {u}_p}(b)}{\\partial
    {\\displaystyle {b}_i}}=p-\\tau y{\\left({\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^N{\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}}\\right)}^{\\tau -1}=0, $$ (11) $$ p=\\tau y{\\left({\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^N{\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}}\\right)}^{\\tau -1}, $$ (12) according to the expressions (10), (11) and
    (12), we can get the utility function of the SUs as: $$ \\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle
    {u}_s}\\left({\\displaystyle {b}_i}\\right)={\\displaystyle { \\log}_2}\\left(1+\\frac{1.5}{
    \\ln \\left(0.2/{\\theta}_{BER}\\right)}\\gamma \\right){\\displaystyle {b}_i}\\\\
    {}\\begin{array}{ccc}\\hfill \\hfill & \\hfill \\hfill & \\hfill \\hfill \\end{array}-\\frac{1}{2}N{\\displaystyle
    {{\\displaystyle {b}_i}}^2}-{\\displaystyle \\tau y{\\left({\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^N{\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}}\\right)}^{\\tau -1}{\\displaystyle {b}_i}}\\end{array} $$ (13) 2.3 Algorithm
    analysis In the proposed algorithm, we assume that the SU i can obtain its utility
    function u s (b i ) with information of spectrum pool. All SUs do not take loan
    strategy simultaneously. But a group of SUs take the strategy firstly. And then
    another group of the SUs will take corresponding suitable strategy according to
    the previous SUs’ strategy. Based on the historical strategies, the SUs will select
    the optimized strategy to guide their game behaviors. With some round of repeated
    games, the spectrum bandwidth leased by the SUs will reach Nash equilibrium. The
    flow chart of Stackelberg game algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. And DSA algorithm
    based on Stackelberg game model is shown in Algorithm 1. Fig. 3 Flow chart of
    Stackelberg game algorithm Full size image Algorithm 1: DSA algorithm Input: N, θ
    BER , γ, x, y, τ Output: b i , u s (b i ) 1. Calculate u s (b i ) according to
    (13) with the initial value. 2. Calculate spectrum bandwidth b i with (14) when
    utility function of SU i+1 obtain the maximum value. 3. According to the formula
    (15), obtain strategy summation value \\( {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}} \\). 4. Calculate u s (B i ) of the prior SU i according to (13) with
    the initial value. 5. Substitute (16) into (17), calculate B i when utility function
    of the prior SU i obtain the maximum value. 6. According to (19), calculate summation
    value \\( {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\displaystyle {B}_i}} \\). 7. Substitute
    (19) into (16), calculate strategy values of n following SUs \\( {\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\displaystyle {b}_i}} \\). The proposed algorithm works as follows:
    Step 1: With the initial value of θ BER , γ, τ and y, for example, θ BER  = 10− 4,
    γ = 15.4dB, τ = 2, y = 1/2, we can calculate the utility function u s (b i ) of
    SU i according to expression (13), in the case the strategy value of the prior
    SU i is B i , and the summation is \\( {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\displaystyle
    {B}_i}} \\), where m is the number of the prior SUs, n is the number of the following
    SUs. Then we can get the utility function of the following SU i is: $$ {\\displaystyle
    {u}_s}\\left({\\displaystyle {b}_i}\\right)=\\left(2-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\displaystyle
    {B}_i}}-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j\\ne i}^n{\\displaystyle {b}_j}}-{\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}\\right){\\displaystyle {b}_i}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(n+m\\right){\\displaystyle
    {{\\displaystyle {b}_i}}^2}. $$ (14) Step 2: Equation (14) is a quadratic function,
    and solve the value of b i when the function obtain the maximum value: $$ {\\displaystyle
    {b}_i}=\\frac{1}{2+n+m}\\left(2-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\displaystyle {B}_i}}-{\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{j\\ne i}^n{\\displaystyle {b}_j}}\\right). $$ (15) Step 3: According to
    the Eq. (15), we obtain strategy values of n following SUs: $$ {\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\displaystyle {b}_i}}=\\frac{n\\left(2-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\displaystyle
    {B}_i}}\\right)}{1+2n+m}. $$ (16) Step 4: Then the utility function of the prior
    SU i is: $$ {\\displaystyle {u}_s}\\left({\\displaystyle {B}_i}\\right)=\\left(2-{\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\displaystyle {b}_i}}-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j\\ne i}^m{\\displaystyle
    {B}_j}}-{\\displaystyle {B}_i}\\right){\\displaystyle {B}_i}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(n+m\\right){\\displaystyle
    {{\\displaystyle {B}_i}}^2}. $$ (17) Step 5: Substitute (16) into the Eq. (17),
    and then we can calculate spectrum bandwidth B i when utility function of the
    prior SU i obtain the maximum value. $$ {\\displaystyle {B}_i}=\\frac{1+n+m}{2{\\displaystyle
    {n}^2}+{\\displaystyle {m}^2}+3 nm+3n+3m+2}\\left(2-{\\displaystyle \\sum_{j\\ne
    i}^m{\\displaystyle {B}_j}}\\right). $$ (18) Step 6: According to the Eq. (18),
    we obtain strategy values of m prior SUs. $$ {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\displaystyle
    {B}_i}}=\\frac{2m\\left(1+n+m\\right)}{2{\\displaystyle {n}^2}+2{\\displaystyle
    {m}^2}+4\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{n}+2\\mathrm{n}+3\\mathrm{m}+1}. $$ (19) Step 7: Substitute
    expression (19) into the Eq. (16), then we can get strategy values of n following
    SUs as: $$ {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\displaystyle {b}_i}}=\\frac{n\\left(4{\\displaystyle
    {n}^2}+2{\\displaystyle {m}^2}+6mn+4n+4m+2\\right)}{\\left(1+2n+m\\right)\\left(2{\\displaystyle
    {n}^2}+2{\\displaystyle {m}^2}+4mn+2\\mathrm{n}+3m+1\\right)}. $$ (20) Lemma 1
    For the proposed DSA algorithm based on Stackelberg model, there are N game players,
    the strategic space of the players is S 1, ⋯, S N , the utility function is μ
    1, ⋯, μ N , the Nash equilibrium is existence. Proof According to the game model
    defined in (1), in the proposed DSA algorithm, there are N SUs, which indicates
    the set of participants is limited. And the strategic space for each game player
    i is S i , si is strategy and s i  ∈ S i , {s 1, ⋯, s N } is the strategy combination
    for all players. The strategic set is closed and bounded convex set. According
    to the description of the utility function u s (b i ) of SUi with the benefit
    of bandwidth b i as shown in expression (2) and (13), we can see that the utility
    function u s (b i ) in action space is continuous, quasi-concave function. The
    analysis mentioned above shows that game process of the proposed scheme satisfies
    the conditions of the existence of Nash equilibrium. This completes the proof.
    3 Performance analysis In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme,
    the DSA algorithm is implemented in Matlab simulation platform. In the simulation,
    all SUs are with same capacity. In order to analyze competition among SUs, the
    simulation considers the spectrum access times during the user choice, mutual
    interference between users and the scale of secondary CRNs. And the performance
    of the proposed scheme will be evaluated in the terms of Nash equilibrium, convergence
    of the game process, and the total amount of leased spectrum of SUs. 3.1 Effectiveness
    of the proposed algorithm In this scenario, we consider there are two SUs, namely
    SU1 and SU2. The leased bandwidth of two SUs are b 1 and b 2 respectively, and
    the values of b 1 and b 2 are initialized stochastically. The response function
    curves of two SUs are shown in Fig. 4, respectively. Fig. 4 Nash equilibrium Full
    size image According to the expression (15), the values of b 1 and b 2 are in
    the range [0, 2]. Assume that b 1 increases 0.1 by step, the value of b 2 gradually
    decreases until 0 with the increasing of b 1. On the contrary, if b 2 increases
    0.1 by step, the value of b 1 gradually decreases until 0 with the increasing
    of b 2, and the intersection of two curves is the Nash equilibrium point, where
    both b 1 and b 2 are 0.4. The results show that the proposed DSA is convergent
    and will reach the steady state. In the second scenario, we will focus on the
    detailed game process of SUs and the convergence of the proposed game algorithm
    with varying number of SUs. And the results are shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, with
    4, 6 and 8 SUs respectively. When the game reaches steady state, the strategy
    values of SUs converge to their Nash equilibrium points respectively. Fig. 5 Game
    process of 4 SUs Full size image Fig. 6 Game process of 6 SUs Full size image
    Fig. 7 Game process of 8 SUs Full size image As shown in Fig. 5, the spectrum
    bandwidth leased by SUs will vary with the game process of 4 SUs competing idle
    spectrum of PUs as game times increasing. In initialization, we set the initial
    strategy values of the prior SU1 and SU2 as 0.125 MHz and 0.75 MHz respectively,
    and the initial strategy values of the following SU1 and SU2 are 0.08 MHz and
    0.5 MHz respectively. Since the initial strategy values of all SUs are not identical
    and not equal to the Nash equilibrium point, each SU will adjust its strategy.
    As game times increasing, the strategy values of 4 SUs gradually approach to the
    Nash equilibrium point in the game process. And after 5 games, they reach the
    steady state and converge to their Nash equilibrium points respectively. From
    Fig. 5, we can see the Nash equilibrium point of the prior SUs is always greater
    than that of the following SUs, which demonstrates the first-mover advantage in
    Stackelberg game algorithm. From Fig. 6, we can see the game results with 6 SUs.
    In this case, we set that the initial strategy values of the prior SU1, SU2 and
    SU3 as 0.1 MHz, 0.4 MHz and 0.8 MHz, and the initial strategy values of following
    SU1, SU2 and SU3 are 0.05 MHz, 0.25 MHz and 0.6MHZ respectively. In order to obtain
    more spectrums, all SUs will adjust their game strategies to achieve more benefit.
    During the repeated games, the strategy values of 6 SUs fluctuate obviously and
    come to approach to the Nash equilibrium point gradually. After 6 rounds game,
    they reach the steady state and converge to their Nash equilibrium points. As
    shown in Fig. 6, Nash equilibrium point of the prior SUs is always greater than
    that of the following SUs. However, the value of the former is slightly higher
    than that of the latter. As shown in Fig. 7, we can see the similar results. And
    the initial strategy values of the prior SU1, SU2, SU3 and SU4 are 0.1 MHz, 0.2MHZ,
    0.4MHZ and 0.8MHZ respectively. And the initial strategy values of the following
    SU1, SU2, SU3 and SU4 are 0.05 MHz, 0.3 MHz, 0.5 MHz and 0.75MHZ respectively.
    Each SU will adjust its strategy to get more bandwidth. With the game times increasing,
    the strategy values of 8 SUs oscillate obviously in the game process. After 7
    games, all SUs get to the steady state and converge to their Nash equilibrium
    points. However, the difference of Nash equilibrium points between the prior SUs
    and the following SUs is very slight. From Figs. 5, 6 and 7, we can see that,
    with limited idle spectrum limited of PUs, if the number of game participants
    is small, the strategy value (spectrum bandwidth) of the prior SUs is greater
    than that of the following SUs when the game reaches the steady state. The results
    show the first-mover advantage in Stackelberg game. However with the increasing
    of the number of SUs, the strategy value of prior SUs is closer to that of following
    SUs at steady state. And the game times of reaching Nash equilibrium point will
    not increase greatly, which shows that the greater number of game participants,
    the less obvious the first-mover advantage in Stackelberg model is. At the same
    time, free spectrum bandwidth leased by each SU will decrease; while the proposed
    DSA based Stackelberg game algorithm solves the fairness of leasing idle spectrum
    resources among SUs. And the total spectrum bandwidth leased by all SUs also increased.
    The results show that the proposed DSA maximizes the utilization of spectrum resources
    efficiently. The total amount of spectrum leased by SUs with different SNR and
    varying number of SUs is shown in Fig. 8. When the game reaches the steady state,
    the spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs will vary with the number of SUs increased
    from 2 to 30. Fig. 8 Total spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs with varying number
    of SUs Full size image As shown in Fig. 8, when the number of SUs is 2, the total
    spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs is minimum. When SNR is 15.4 dB, the bandwidth
    is 0.824 MHz, while the bandwidth is 0.682 MHz when SNR is 11 dB. With the number
    of SUs increasing, the total spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs increases obviously.
    When the number of SUs is larger than 15, the total spectrum bandwidth leased
    by SUs will increase slowly. And when the number of SUs is 30, the total spectrum
    bandwidth leased by SUs approaches to the total idle spectrum bandwidth of PUs,
    and the bandwidths are 0.984 MHz (SNR = 15.4 dB) and 0.821 MHz (SNR = 11 dB) respectively.
    The results show the higher SNR, the more total spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs.
    The income of SUs at steady state with different SNR and varying number of SUs
    is shown in Fig. 9, where the number of SUs increases from 2 to 30. Fig. 9 Income
    of SUs with varying number of SUs Full size image In Fig. 9, when the number of
    SUs is 2, the income of SUs is the maximum. The income of SUs is 0.63 when SNR
    is 15.4 dB, while that is 0.44 when SNR is 11 dB. The reason is spectrum oversupply
    when the number of SUs is very small, and the price of PUs’ idle spectrum is cheap.
    However, with the number of SUs increasing, the income of SUs decreases significantly,
    and when the number of SUs is more than 15, the income of SUs will decrease slowly
    and flat. When there are 30 SUs, the income of SUs is 0.51 as SNR is 15.4 dB,
    and that is 0.36 as SNR is 11 dB. This is because the limited spectrum resources
    of PUs, and with the number of SUs increasing, the requirements of leasing idle
    spectrum increase. Therefore, spectrum price will rise accordingly. The results
    demonstrate the higher SNR will help SUs to obtain more income. The reason is
    that SUs with higher SNR will help SUs to detect the idle spectrum accurately,
    which will increase idle spectrum of PUs. 3.2 Performance comparison In order
    to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, in this scenario, the spectrum
    bandwidth leased by SUs and income of SUs are explored and compared with the Cournot
    game model [26]. The amount of spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs at steady state
    with different algorithms is shown in Fig. 10, where we considers the cases with
    different SNR, and the number of SUs varying from 2 to 30. Fig. 10 Spectrum bandwidth
    leased by SUs of different algorithms Full size image As shown in Fig. 10, with
    the same SNR, the total amount of spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs based on Stackelberg
    game model is greater than that based on Cournot game model. For example, when
    the number of SUs is 5, the spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs is 0.924 MHz of the
    proposed scheme with SNR 15.4 dB, which is higher about 0.014 MHz than that based
    on Cournot game. The reason is that Cournot game model is complete information
    static game model, and all game participants take game strategy simultaneously.
    While the proposed scheme based on Stackelberg game model, is a dynamic game model,
    and a part of game participants will take the strategy firstly, and then the following
    game participants will optimize their own game strategies based on the game strategy
    of the prior game participants. Therefore, such scheme will help the following
    participants can pursue more spectrum bandwidth and get more benefit. With the
    number of SUs increasing, the total spectrum leased by SUs of the two game algorithms
    will increase rapidly. Then the total bandwidth leased by SUs will increase slowly
    when the number of SUs is larger than 10. This is because that the idle spectrum
    of PUs is abundant when the number of game participant is small. Therefore, the
    total bandwidth leased by SUs will increase obviously. As the number of participants
    increasing, idle spectrum of PUs will not increase accordingly, which leads to
    the total bandwidth leased by SUs increasing slowly. However, total spectrum leased
    by SUs of two algorithms comes to close and tends to coincide when the number
    of SUs increases to 30. The reason is that first-mover advantage of Stackelberg
    model will disappear gradually as the number of participants increasing. It’s
    obviously that the higher SNR, the more spectrum bandwidth rented by SUs is. The
    results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better game performance in term
    of bandwidth leased by SUs. The income of SUs at steady state for different algorithms
    is shown in Fig. 11, where we considers the cases with different SNR, and the
    number of SUs varying from 2 to 30. Fig. 11 Income of SUs with different algorithms
    Full size image As shown in Fig. 11, with the same SNR, the income of SUs for
    two game models will decrease obviously, especially for the total number of SUs
    is less than 10. And then the income will degrade slightly. The reason is the
    limited idle spectrum resources of PUs. And as the number of SUs increasing, the
    idle spectrum resources will become scarcity, and spectrum price will correspondingly
    increase, which will lead to the income of SUs decrease accordingly. In addition,
    the income of SUs based on Stackelberg game model is lower than that based on
    Cournot game model. For example, the income of the former is 0.63, and that of
    the latter is 0.64 when there are 2 SUs and SNR is 15.4 dB. This is because the
    total amount of spectrum bandwidth leased by SUs based on Stackelberg game model
    is higher than that of the latter as shown in Fig. 10. However when the number
    of SUs approaches to 30, the income of SUs of two schemes comes to coincide. When
    the SNR changes from 15.4 to 11 dB, the incomes of SUs of two game model algorithms
    will reduce accordingly. The reason is lower SNR will lead to decreasing of the
    total amount of idle spectrum bandwidth, and the spectrum price is not changed.
    Hence, the income of SUs will degrade correspondingly. 4 Conclusion This paper
    proposed a novel DSA algorithm for CRNs based on game theory, which captures the
    game behavior among SUs during a specific leased spectrum and efficiently accounts
    for mutual interference between SUs for various sizes of CRNs. The problem is
    modeled as an oligopolistic competition model. And we have employed the Nash equilibrium
    solution of Stackelberg model in order to obtain the bandwidth of SUs’ leased
    spectrum. An intensive analysis has been presented to characterize the SUs’ leased
    spectrum utilization behavior with respect to various criteria of the proposed
    game theoretic model. In particular, the existing of Nash equilibrium, the game
    process, the convergence of SUs, the total SUs’ leased spectrum, and the SUs’
    income have been carefully investigated. Simulation study shows that our proposed
    scheme enables SUs to efficiently utilize the licensed spectrum shared with PUs
    in a dynamic environment while maximizing the spectrum utilization rate. The performance
    of proposed DSA algorithm was investigated under different SNR regimes. We have
    found as SNR increased, the aggregated bandwidth of the SUs’ leased spectrum will
    be increased. Similarly, increasing SNR will increase SUs’ income. We have also
    compared Stackelberg with Cournot model for the case of same SNR to provide additional
    insights. We have observed that Stackelberg model improves the spectrum utilization
    by increasing the aggregated amount of SUs leased spectrum. However, the increasing
    in leased spectrum comes with boosting the spectrum lease price, which results
    in lower income for Stackelberg model in comparing to Cournot model. References

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: New Orleans, LA, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    Cognitive radio (CR) network is regarded for efficient spectrum access where unlicensed
    CR users access idle spectrum opportunistically without causing harmful interference
    to PUs [1]–[3]. In any cyber-physical systems (CPS), robust realtime feedback
    is one of the major processes [4] which can be achieved using dynamic spectrum
    access with the help of CR technology. To access idle channels, generally, unlicensed
    CR users identify idle bands by using spectrum sensing approaches [1]. However,
    recently, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has mandated the creation
    of spectrum database [1], [5] where unlicensed CR users query for idle bands instead
    of identifying them by sensing wide spectrum regime. In this database-driven spectrum
    access, CR users1 query spectrum database periodically (certain interval of distance
    or time) for updated information about channel availability to ensure that the
    CR users do not interfere PUs. Note that IEEE 802.11 p DSRC standard has been
    already dedicated for wireless access for vehicular communications where 6 channels
    are assigned for actual communication and 1 channel is assigned as common control.
    These channels could be easily congested when vehicle density is high (e.g., traffic
    light stops, intersections in urban areas, etc.) and vehicles may not be able
    to receive/transmit information in real-time. In this case, opportunistic spectrum
    access could enhance the performance of vehicular communication in transportation
    CPS. In this paper, we propose a cloud-assisted GPS-driven dynamic spectrum access
    for transportation CPS where we assumed that each vehicle is equipped with (i)
    GPS unit to find best route for the specified destination address and (ii) two
    coordinated transceivers: one is always connected to cloud (e.g. using 3G/4G link)
    to query spectrum database to find idle channels and the other one is for actual
    communications (using for instance 802.11 p 5.9 GHz bands, ISM 2.4GHz/5GHz bands).
    First, each vehicular CR user finds its best route based on its destination address
    using GPS. Then, the path computed using GPS is used to query spectrum database
    by the CR user for an idle channel set throughout the given route for communications.
    Furthermore, CR users query the spectrum database periodically for updated information
    about spectrum opportunities so as not to harm any PU transmissions. Note that
    when previously found idle channel is not going to be idle anymore (based on the
    latest query result) by the time CR user gets to the given location, CR user switches
    to new channel based on the latest response received from spectrum database. Recent
    work in vehicular networks with cognitive radios includes [6]–[11]. Authors in
    [6] consider spectrum database access for CR users for a given location. In [8],
    authors consider opportunistic spectrum access for vehicular CR users by finding
    idle channels using either sensing or querying the database. The work in [7],
    [9] considers geolocation database access by CR users for opportunistic channel
    access in wide range of wireless channels. Dynamic channel selection in vehicular
    network to maximize the overall throughout has been proposed in [10]. However,
    none of these works available in the literature consider joint use of route determined
    by the GPS for a given destination to find spectrum opportunities, the impact
    of PUs'' ON/OFF activities along the route and spectrum query interval. Fig. 1.
    System model for cloud-assisted GPS-driven dynamic spectrum access in cognitive
    radio enabled vehicular networks where roadside Wi-Fi users are treated as PUs.
    Show All The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: we present the system
    model in Section II and adaptive channel assignment for communication in Section
    III. Numerical results obtained from simulations are presented in Section IV.
    Finally, conclusions are presented in Section V. SECTION II. System Model We consider
    that the vehicular CR users access different wireless channels of different networks
    (e.g., 802.11 p, 802.11b/g, etc.) for communications and use GPS device to find
    the best route for a given destination. Typical system model considered in this
    paper is given in Fig. 1. Each vehicle is assumed to be equipped with 2 transceivers/radios:
    Radio 1 for searching spectrum opportunities and the other one (Radio 2) for actual
    communications which uses opportunistic spectrum access. Radio 1 is assumed to
    be always connected to the internet cloud through 3G/4G link so that it can query
    the spectrum database whenever needed or could serve as a GPS through an app (especially
    when actual GPS device cannot function in urban areas). Note that each CR user
    can have same or different querying range and transmission range. We consider
    that infrastructures of primary networks reports their channel occupancy information
    to cloud server where spectrum database is created using distributed cloud computing
    as shown in Fig 2 and Fig 3. When a vehicle leaves for a given destination, we
    assume that GPS device (or Radio 1 connected through 4G link with the help of
    GPS app) calculates the best route for it. This route information is used by the
    Radio 1 to search for spectrum opportunities along the route from vehicle''s current
    position to its destination and provides a set of recommended channels to be used
    throughout the route. Then, vehicular CR user periodically checks the database
    for updated channel information to avoid any harmful interference to PUs. For
    instance, when a vehicular CR user queries the database based on the route calculated
    by GPS as shown in Fig. 1, it observes that the vehicle cannot use Wi-Fi channels
    1 and 6 in a road segment S2, and channels 6 and 11 in road segment S3 to avoid
    PUs (here residential Wi-Fi users are assumed to be PUs). Vehicles could use any
    channels including DSRC in segments S1 and S3. However, when a vehicle is about
    to enter the segment S3 it checks (as a periodic process) whether any PUs are
    popping up in the upcoming segment. If there is any PU using any channel (say
    channel 11), then vehicular CR users would not be able to use that channel in
    the segment (where the channel is actively used by PUs). A. Cloud Computing for
    Spectrum Processing and Heat Map In order to process huge amount of data about
    spectrum occupancy information obtained from spectrum sensors or infrastructure
    of primary networks for different channels, there is a need for cloud based computing
    and storage resources for the purpose of distributed storage and distributed computation.
    Furthermore, to provide overall heat-map for different bands and spectrum access
    technology as a service for vehicular CR users, cloud computing and storage are
    crucial. Similar to different cloud services, the cloud integration allows our
    technology to be adopted as a service. Moreover, in our approach, there is a need
    for real-time processing of spectrum occupancy information, for updating the Cassandra
    database and for querying the database. We propose to implement the algorithm
    in the Storm system, a real-time processing system, which is also currently used
    by Twitter to process trending topics. For cloud computing, among Riak [12], Cassandra
    [13] and Memcached [14], we chose Cassandra due to its proven robustness, real-time
    performance and commercial adoption by Twitter. Storm and Cassandra [15] are integrated
    by provided generic and configurable backtype. storm. Bolt implementation that
    writes Storm Tuple objects to a Cassandra Column Family for having separate bolts
    for processing massive data for different bands such as TV, DSRC and Wi-Fi as
    shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Cloud computing for processing and creating spectrum
    map is out of the scope of this paper and interested readers are referred to [1],
    [9] for further details. Fig. 2. Distributed remote procedure call (RPC) work-flow.
    Show All B. Transmission Power vs. Range in CR Vehicular Network For a given transmission
    power p t , the power p r at the receiver at a distance R can be expressed as
    [16] p r = p t G t G r h t h r ( 1 4π ) 2                  

    transmit and receive antenna gains, h t and h r are, respectively, height of transmit
    and receive antenna, λ is the wavelength2, and α p ∈[2,4] , is the path loss exponent
    [16] for vehicular communications. Then, from eq. (1), the transmission power
    is expressed as [10] p t = p r G e λ 2 L α p . (2) View Source Fig. 3. Storm topology
    for real-time processing in cloud computing platform and generating spectrum heat
    map framework Show All This shows that the transmit power p t depends on the frequency/wavelength
    that the vehicular users choose to communicate and the range they want to cover
    in cognitive radio vehicular network. When vehicular CR user switches channel,
    transmission power can be adapted to keep the same transmit range as they had
    before as long as they do not exceed the upper bound of power limit set by the
    FCC. We assume that each vehicular CR user queries the spectrum database for the
    entire route (from current location to the destination address) in a regular interval
    of distance or time (whichever comes first3) to ensure that the CR users are not
    creating any harmful interference to PUs. SECTION III. Adaptive Channel Assignment
    and Communications in CR Vehicular Network We consider that there are several
    independent channels (e.g., 7 channels in 5.9GHz DSRC band, 11 channels in 2.4
    GHz ISM band and so on) which are used in vehicular communications. We assume
    that each CR user searches the spectrum database for idle channels and it sees
    the primary network states as busy or idle. This process of monitoring a channel
    (by querying a database) can be modeled as a semi-Markov model. As presented in
    [18], the PU being ON and being OFF are exponentially distributed with parameters
    α and β respectively. The probability of PU being present and absent are represented
    by p p and p a respectively and are given as p p = α α+β , p a = β α+β . (3) View
    Source Based on the activity of primary networks, we adopt an estimation method
    [19] that uses probability of sensing/identifying channels based on periodic query
    time t . Let P S0 represents that the primary channel will be idle after t seconds
    where S∈{0,1} with S=0 if the channel is idle and S=1 if the channel is used by
    the primary network. Then, the probability P S0 can be expressed as P S0 ={ p

    the probability P S1 for S∈{0,1} that the channel will be used by PUs after periodic
    query time t second is given as P S1 ={ p p − p p . e −(α+β)t  for S=0 p p + p
    a . e −(α+β)t  for S=1. (5) View Source where the time t is a query interval either
    it is obtained based on the distance or it is set for every given time interval
    (e.g. t=1 second or so) or whichever comes first. For a given transmission range
    L meter and vehicle speed v , each vehicular CR user should query the spectrum
    database with a given period t=min{ L v , t p }second. (6) View Source where t
    p is query interval. Note that when a vehicle travels with a speed of 75 mph,
    it could travel 33.5 meter in a second. Thus, we consider that each vehicle queries
    spectrum database for every 33.5 meter distance or every t p =1 second or whichever
    comes first. The expected channel capacity R n for a given channel n based on
    the achievable data rate R a (e.g. 11 Mbps, 24 Mbps, 54 Mbps, etc.) and the channel
    used probability by PU P S1 is given as R n = R a .(1− P S1 ). (7) View Source
    . Then, data rate per CR user can be computed as R 1 n = R n N n , (8) View Source
    where N n is the total number of CR users in a channel n within a given radio
    range that is estimated based on the periodic broadcast status message (refer
    to [20] for further detail). To choose the best channel, CR user selects the channel
    among available ones that offers highest data rate and satisfies its minimum data
    rate ( R T ) requirement as c=arg max n R 1 n ,∀n,s.t.  R 1 n ≥ R T . (9) View
    Source For instance, for a given scenario in Fig. 1, a CR vehicular user can select
    channel 11 up to the middle of segment S4 to get high data rate. Then CR user
    can not select the channel 11 for the rest of the segment S4 as it creates harmful
    interference to PUs and could get low data rate. Because of the error in transmission,
    each vehicular CR user may have to retransmit the information. Thus, we adopt
    the expected transmission count [21] which is the average number of transmissions
    needed to transfer a packet between vehicles. Considering the probability of transmission
    errors in forward link (down link) and reverse link (uplink) respectively as p
    d and p u , a probability of transmission failure can be written as p f =1−(1−
    p u )(1− p d ). (10) View Source and the expected transmission count (TC), which
    tells us how many times the data has to be retransmitted for successful delivery,
    can be expressed as TC= ∑ m=1 ∞ m. p m−1 f (1− p f )=⌈ 1 1− p f ⌉, (11) View Source
    where ⌈.⌉ is a ceiling operator. The eq. (11) shows that when failure probability
    p f is 1 (all transmissions failure all the time), TC will be infinitely large.
    Along the line of [22], the average time for successful data delivery could be
    expressed in terms of expected transmission time (TT) for data of size D bits
    with a data rate R 1 n over a link n as TT=TC. D R 1 n . (12) View Source To be
    able to deliver the packet of size D bits successfully, vehicles traveling with
    a relative speed of v meter-per-second and overlap transmission range of O r meter
    in vehicle-to-vehicle communication or vehicle-to-roadside communication should
    satisfy the following condition O r v ≥TT. (13) View Source Otherwise, complete
    message/data will not be transferred between communicating vehicles using given
    data rate. CR user may have to switch to another channel for higher data rate
    so that they could exchange complete message. SECTION IV. Simulation and Numerical
    Results We considered that the vehicular CR users use (i) DSRC bands and (ii)
    CR network with 802.11 Wi-Fi (and DSRC) if DSRC bands are highly congested and
    Wi-Fi channels idle as shown in Fig. 4. In the first experiment, we plotted the
    variation of total achievable rates in a channel n versus the probability P S1
    (i.e., the probability of PUs being active in a given channel) for given achievable
    data rates that are available in 802.11 p DSRC and 802.11 Wi-Fi networks as shown
    in Fig. 5. It is noted that when primary channel is used by PUs, i.e., P S1 =1
    , CR users are not allowed to access the channel which results in zero total achievable
    rate as shown in Fig. 5. When channel access probability of PU P S1 decreases,
    the achievable data rate of CR user increases as CR user gets more channel access
    opportunities. As expected, for higher data rate, CR user gets higher achievable
    rate as in Fig. 5. Fig. 4. Sample scenarios (SC1, SC2 and SC3) for available networks
    with their data rates (mbps) for DSRC (802.11p) only and for CR networks (with
    DSRC and Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n) versus the time instances. Show All Fig. 5. Variation
    of achievable rate in a channel n for variable probability P S1 (i.e., the probability
    of pus being active in the given channel) for given data rates. Show All Next,
    we plotted the variation of per CR user rate R 1 n in a channel n versus the number
    of CR users ( N n ) for different data rates ( R a ) when P S1 =0.5 as shown in
    Fig. 6. The rate R 1 n decreases when the number of users increases and vice versa.
    For a given number of users, higher the data rate R a , higher the user rate R
    1 n is as shown in Fig. 6. Then, we plotted the variation of expected transmission
    count versus the different probability of failure ( p f ) for a given channel
    in Fig. 7. We noted that the expected transmission count increases exponentially
    with increase in probability of failure as shown in Fig. 7. Furthermore, the expected
    transmission count is infinity when probability of failure is 100% (i.e., ( p
    f =1) . This implies that the there would not be successful transmission when
    p f =100% in the network. Fig. 6. Variation of rates in a channel n for each CR
    user for variable number of CR users ( N n ) and data rates ( R a ) when P S1
    =0.5 Show All Fig. 7. Variation of expected transmission count for different failure
    probability p f values for a given channel. Show All Next, we plotted the variation
    of expected transmission time versue the expected transmission count for transmission
    failure probability values p f ={0,0.1,0.2,…,0.9} ., data rate R a =11 Mbps ,
    and data size D=100 KB 4 as shown in Fig. 8. For a given data size, when expected
    transmit count increases (which increases with probability of transmission failure),
    expected transmission time increases as shown in Fig. 8. Furthermore, we noted
    that the expected transmission time increases with increase in number of CR users
    for a given P S1 as shown in Fig. 8. When transmission failure probability p f
    =1 , the expected transmit count becomes infinity and thus expected transmit time
    becomes infinity implying that there would not be successful transmission. Then,
    we plotted the variation of expected transmission time versus the variable data
    size. We considered different transmission rates and probability of failure p
    f while considering probability of PUs being active P S1 =0.5 . As expected, transmission
    time increases when data size to be transmitted increases as shown in Fig. 9.
    Similarly, for a given data size (e.g., 500 KB), the expected transmission time
    increases when data rate decreases and vice versa for a given failure probability
    p f value. Furthermore, for given data size (e.g., 500 KB) and data rate (e.g.,
    11 Mbps), when p f increases from 0.1 to 0.5, expected time is almost doubled
    as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 8. Variation of expected transmission time (TT) vs. Transmission
    count (TC) for transmission failure probability value p f ={0,0.1,0.2,…,0.9} ,
    data rate R a =11 Mbps , and data size D=100 KB . Show All Fig. 9. Variation of
    expected transmission time vs. variable data size for different transmission rates
    and probability of failure p f when probability of PU s being active P S1 =0.5
    Show All Finally, we plotted the variation of expected transmission time verus
    the variable data rate for different number of CR users ( N n ) and probability
    of transmission failure ( p f ) when probability of PUs being active is P S1 =0.5
    as shown in Fig. 10. We observed that, for lower data rate, the expected transmission
    time is higher as shown in Fig. 10. For a given scenario, expected transmission
    time is lower for the higher number of CR users in a given channel. For instance,
    for a data size 100 KB with transmission data rate of 27 Mbps, expected transmission
    time is lower by half for N n =100 than that for N n =200 as shown in Fig. 10.
    Similarly, when the number of CR users N n =300 and the transmission failure probability
    p f is 0.9, expected transmission time is almost twelve times greater than that
    when the number of CR users N n =50 and the transmission failure probability p
    f is 0.1. We observed that when there are few users competing for channel access,
    there could be less transmission failure and given data could be transmitted faster
    and vice versa. Fig. 10. Variation of expected transmission time vs. variable
    data rate for different number of CR users when probability of pus being active
    P S1 =0.5 . Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a
    cloud-assisted GPS-driven dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio vehicular
    networks for transportation CPS where each vehicular CR user calculates the best
    route to its destination using GPS device and queries the spectrum database for
    spectrum opportunities for a given route. To receive updated spectrum occupancy
    information, CR users query database periodically to make sure that the band is
    still available and use of the band is not creating any harmful interference to
    PUs. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach using numerical
    results obtained from simulations. We have analyzed the effect of PUs'' activities
    in the cloud-assisted GPS-driven dynamic spectrum access. When PUs were active
    most of the time with high probability P S1 ., data rate of CR users decreased
    significantly as there were less spectrum opportunities for CR users. Effect of
    number of CR users in a given channel in terms of data rate has been analyzed
    where increase in number of CR users resulted in decrease in data rate as they
    had to share the same channel. Furthermore, expected transmit count increased
    exponentially with increased in transmission failure probability that resulted
    in high expected transmission time for given data size. As expected, we found
    that the transmit time increased when transmission rate decreased. We conclude
    that there should be some trade-off between number of users per channel, delay
    introduced by query process and data rate in cognitive radio enabled vehicular
    networks to get reliable wireless communications for transportation CPS. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Kozhikode, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Today''s wireless networks face the issue of spectral congestion problem, due
    to the fixed spectrum allocation policy. Cognitive Radio (CR), proposed by Joseph
    Mitola III [1], is an emerging wireless communication paradigm that can significantly
    improve the spectrum usage efficiency by offering dynamic spectrum access. CR
    Networks (CRNs) with such spectrum aware devices is the obvious eminent future
    of today''s wireless networks. In multi-hop CRNs, routing is the most significant
    problem to be addressed as it determines the performance of the network. Development
    of a spectrum agile routing solution for CRNs is a major challenge [2]. CR devices
    become aware of their radio environment through its spectrum sensing functionality.
    Several spectrum sensing algorithms are available in the literature with the energy
    detector, the cyclostationary feature detector, and the matched filter detector
    being the mostly discussed among them [1]. In a CRN, the spectrum opportunities
    of each CR device will be location dependent. In such a scenario, an effective
    routing solution is a cross layer design where dynamic spectrum allocation is
    done along with routing [3]. Considering this, a cross layer routing solution
    is proposed in this paper. Routing protocol being used in most of the existing
    work is the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol and its variations
    [2]. In AODV, the Route Request (RREQ) messages, which are sent via broadcasting,
    contain locally obtained network state and deliver this detailed information to
    the destination, where they are processed to compute paths [2]. And the routing
    decisions being adopted at the destination are then forwarded in the reverse path
    using the Route Reply (RREP) messages. Here comes the need for a protocol in CRN
    that can perform the routing as the control packet moves from one point to another.
    Such a routing protocol is the Routing Protocol for Low power and lossy networks
    (RPL). Once the control packet reaches the end node, the routing is completed
    and data transmission can be initiated in the next instant [4]. This paper proposes
    to use RPL as the routing protocol in CRNs. RPL is actually a routing protocol
    developed for the low power and lossy networks. It is the main candidate for acting
    as a standard routing protocol for Internet Protocol (IP) smart object networks
    [4]. CRs being smart, it can be effectively implemented as a promising routing
    solution for a CRN. As the name suggests, it can prove worthy for those networks
    with frequent link outages and CRN is one among them. RPL is based on the topological
    concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). In this algorithm, routing is performed
    through the construction of a colored Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs) with
    destination as the root and source(s) as the leaf node(s). Link frequencies are
    represented using different colors which make the DODAG a colored one. For any
    routing algorithm, routing metric is of paramount importance as it determines
    the quality of the resulting route [5]. It determines the best route from a source
    to destination. RPL gives choice of many metrics and constraints which are flexible
    enough to be used in a CRN scenario. The proposed algorithm chooses the path with
    the minimum hop count and the minimum adjacent link interference as the best path.
    Also, two nodes will communicate in a CRN only if there exists a common channel
    between them. Unpredictable link failures due to the appearance of primary users
    (PUs) is common in CRN. Unquestionably, a repairing algorithm is essential to
    be defined when a routing algorithm is proposed. It should allow a rerouting in
    terms of channels and/or nodes. This paper uses Trickle algorithm for route repair
    which is actually a part of RPL [4]. Trickle algorithm optimizes the control plane
    overhead based on network conditions [6]. This paper is structured as follows.
    Section II depicts the routing model giving the details of the cross layer design
    and the routing metrics being used in this work. Section III gives an overview
    of the RPL and the proposed routing algorithm. Section IV describes the implementation
    of route repair using the Trickle algorithm. Section V presents the simulation
    results and the analysis. Finally, Section VI provides the concluding remarks.
    SECTION II. Routing Model A. Network Model In this routing design, the CRN is
    assumed to be deployed as an infrastructure network. It consists of CR users (CRUs)
    (also referred as nodes in this work) and CR Base Station (CBS). Each user has
    a single-hop connection to its base station. It coexists with the primary network
    with PUs and Primary Base Station (PBS). The PUs access the PBS through the licensed
    spectrum bands. CRUs can access the PBS in the band licensed to PUs without interfering
    them. The reference network model used in this design is shown in Fig. 1. The
    proposed routing design is applied to a slowly varying spectrum environment. The
    channel frequencies available in the area are represented using colors [3]. Always
    two CRUs can communicate only if they hold a common channel in their spectral
    map. The transmission range of all the CRUs is considered to be the same in the
    process of neighbor discovery. The network management information flows through
    the Common Control Channel (CCC) available in the network. Ultra Wide Band (UWB)
    based design of CCC can be assumed to be used in this algorithm as it offers large
    bandwidth [1]. Fig. 1. Network model. Show All B. Cross Layer Design Several spectrum
    bands (1, …, M) may exist in the area and the CRUs may have different views of
    the available spectrum bands. So it is necessary that each CRU in the network
    to be spectrum agile. The problem of routing in multi-hop CRNs targets the creation
    and the maintenance of wireless multihop paths among CRUs by deciding both the
    relay nodes and the spectrum to be used on each link of the path [2]. Such a routing
    solution, typically known as a cross layer design, is proposed in this paper.
    C. Routing Metrics In a routing algorithm, the routing metrics play the role of
    the criteria based on which the best route for forwarding packets from source
    to destination is found. This routing design makes use of two simple metrics to
    calculate the route: Hop count: It is defined as the total number of hops between
    two nodes. According to this design, that route with the minimum hop count from
    source to destination is chosen as the best route. Adjacent link interference:
    It is obvious that if two adjacent links use the same frequency channel for communication
    at the same time, they will interfere with each other. According to this design,
    that route in which adjacent links do not use the same frequency is chosen as
    the best route. SECTION III. Overview of RPL RPL is the acronym for Routing Protocol
    for Low power and lossy networks [4]. RPL is a distance vector routing protocol
    that specifies how to build a DODAG using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [4]. DAG is a directed graph with no cycles and with all edges oriented towards
    one or more root nodes. DODAG is a DAG rooted at a single root. RPL constructs
    DODAGs with destination as the root node and the source(s) as the leaf node(s).
    Intermediate nodes in a route are the routers. Once the DODAG is constructed routing
    is completed and the parent of each node is a potential next hop to the root node.
    In the CRN scenario, a colored DODAG is constructed, which is shown in Fig. 2.
    And the route from source to destination is the upward route from leaf to root
    of the DODAG. Several DODAGs may exist in a network and together they form the
    RPL instance. All the nodes in a DODAG have a rank indicating its position with
    respect to other nodes. Also root node upgrades the version of the DODAG occasionally.
    Fig. 2. Colored DODAG. Show All A. RPL Control Messages RPL uses several control
    messages to perform routing [4]. In this routing design, only two RPL control
    messages are considered, DODAG Information Object (DIO) and DODAG Information
    Solicitation (DIS). The DIO and the DIS can be explained in detail as, DIO: The
    DIO carries information that allows a node to discover an RPL Instance, learn
    its configuration parameters, select a DODAG parent set, and maintain the DODAG
    [4]. It is the root that starts issuing the DIO which passes through the network
    via multicast to form the DODAG. DIO contains the options field [5]. When the
    type = 2 in options field, it becomes a DAG metric container object. DIS: Used
    by a node to retrieve DIO from another neighboring node [4]. it is used in route
    repairing. B. DAG Metric Container Object It holds the metrics and constraints
    used for routing. Object body can carry one or more sub-objects [5]. The used
    objects are of two types, Hopcount Object: Used to report the number of nodes
    traversed along the path. It is used as a metric. Each visited node simply increments
    the hopcount field in the object body [5]. It helps in finding the shortest path
    and the rank of a node. Link Color Object: It is used as a metric (can only be
    recorded) and a constraint [5]. When used as a metric, it cannot be called as
    routing metric. It is just a metric that helps to implement RPL in the CRN scenario.
    When a node is visited, the channels available at the node are recorded in the
    object body as different Type-I sub-objects, shown in Fig. 3. This helps to find
    out whether connectivity can be established between two nodes. When used as a
    constraint, the object body contains Type-II sub-objects, shown in Fig. 4. It
    is a routing constraint which helps to reduce adjacent link interference. It holds
    the channel/color used by the sending node to communicate with its parent so that
    it is not used in next link. It is not a mandatory constraint as connection establishment
    is considered with more importance. Fig. 3. Type-I sub-object. Show All Fig. 4.
    Type-II sub-object. Show All C. DODAG Construction/Routing Algorithm DODAG construction
    starts at the destination [4]. The source sends a beacon to the CBS requesting
    data transmission to a specific destination. It intimates the destination about
    the request and conveys the source address to it through another beacon. To initiate
    the construction, the root (destination) broadcasts the DIO to all its neighbors.
    The CRUs receiving it will either act as a router or a leaf. A router will process
    the DIO and rebroadcast it with sufficient modifications. DODAG construction ends
    upon reaching the leaf node, which is the source, so is the routing. In the DODAG
    formed, each CRU will have a parent list, but the potential next hop to the root
    for each CRU will be the most preferred parent (the one that mandatorily obeys
    the link color constraint) from it. So the default path will be the one in which
    adjacent links use different colors. When a DIO is being multicasted many neighbors
    receive it. When a CRU that is not yet associated with any DODAG receives the
    DIO, it will accept the DIO and proceed further only if there exists a common
    channel to communicate with the sender. If passed in this criteria, it will (i)
    add the DIO sender address to its parent list, (ii) compute its rank by adding
    one to the sender''s rank, (iii) allocate a channel for the link with the sender
    (spectrum allocation), and (iv) forward the DIO message with the updated rank
    information. When a CRU that is connected with a DODAG receives the DIO, it will
    accept the DIO and proceed further only if it satisfies some criteria [4]. Once
    it also passes the common channel check, DIO is processed. Here it will compute
    its new rank according the received DIO and compare it with its own rank. If own
    rank is less than the newly computed one, the sender is discarded and the location
    in DODAG is maintained. But if equal, the sender is added to the parent list but
    the location in DODAG is maintained. And if greater, the sender is added to the
    parent list, the existing list is discarded and the CRU moves to an improved location
    in DODAG and finally allocates a channel for the link to the sender based on the
    constraint. Algorithm 1 summarizes this. SECTION IV. Route Repair Using Trickle
    Algorithm Route repair is an eminent feature required whenever a routing protocol
    is defined. Link failures are only considered in this design. RPL offers two types
    of repair mechanisms, local and global repair [4] which are made possible through
    the Trickle algorithm [6]. Local repair finds an alternate channel/path to continue
    transmission and global repair causes rerouting. The Trickle algorithm allows
    nodes in a lossy shared medium to exchange information in a highly robust, energy
    efficient, simple, and scalable manner [6]. Each node periodically generates DIO
    messages triggered by the Trickle timer which helps in identifying the network
    inconsistencies and thus trigger a repair procedure. The message transmission
    frequency and hence the control plane overhead is optimized based on network conditions
    [6]. A. Trickle Parameters and Variables There are certain parameters based on
    which a Trickle timer performs its fuction [6]. The timer runs for a defined interval
    and has three configuration parameters, Algorithm 1 Operation of a Router in Routing
    The minimum interval size, Imin: Two or three times the transmission time for
    k data packets. Imin=2∗Tx n − time∗k (1) View Source where the Tx n − time will
    depend on the scheduling of transmission and k is the redundancy constant. A traffic
    aware scheduling is considered here [7]. The maximum interval size, Imax: Number
    of doublings of the Imin required to reach the maximum interval time, I_max. I
    − max=Imin∗ 2 Imax (2) View Source It is actually given by, I − mαx=Ls/4 (3) View
    Source Imax=lo g 2 ( I − max/Imin) (4) View Source where Ls is the total schedule
    length for transmission [7]. The redundancy constant, k , is a natural number:
    Atleast a consistent DIO from the default parent must arrive at a node in an interval,
    so k=1 . The variables are, I , the current interval size. t , a time within the
    current interval. c , a counter. B. Repairing Algorithm The Trickle algorithm
    starts execution with the data transmission. At the beginning, interval size is
    set at I=Imin . At a particular scheduled time, t∈[I/2, I) , the CBS intimates
    the DODAG root to transmit the DIO. The root then multicasts the DIO to all its
    neighbors after modifying it according to the results of channel sensing. Among
    the neighbors receiving it, only those involved in the current data transmission
    and those with root as default parent will only accept the DIO. On accepting the
    DIO it will go for the consistency check (whether the channel color used with
    the parent is still present in the set of common colors) using the spectrum sensing
    functionality. If the color is found absent upon the consistency check, the CRU
    calls for a local repair. If an alternate common channel is found absent between
    the them, the CRU sends a DIS message to the alternate parents in its parent list
    to find a new credible path to the root. Now if in all ways the local repair is
    found insufficient, the algorithm calls for a global repair. After global repair,
    data transmission is resumed for the remaining number of packets to be delivered
    to the destination. If the DIO is found consistent, the CRU will just multicast
    its modified DIO to its neighbors, after incrementing its consistency counter
    (c), present at each node, by one. And the next one in the route will perform
    the same steps as the previous upon the reception of the new DIO. The interval
    ends at I and each CRU will send its c value to its default parent which ultimately
    reaches the root. The CBS will check whether at any CRU, c<k . If found so, it
    will reset the trickle timer interval to Imin, else the interval time is doubled.
    If the new I> I − max , the I is set at I − max . The new interval, then starts
    and the process repeats. Algorithm 2 summarizes this. Algorithm 2 Operation of
    a Router in Route Repairing SECTION V. Simulation Results and Analysis This section
    highlights the results obtained through a MATLAB simulation. The topology and
    channel availability of each node used in this simulation are as shown in Table
    I. Over an area of 200m × 200m, about 21 nodes (A, B, C,… U) are homogeneously
    distributed. Also six frequency channels are allocated randomly over the area
    which are represented using the colors red, green, blue, yellow, black and magenta.
    It is assumed that this channel availability at each node is obtained through
    any efficient spectrum sensing algorithm available in literature [1]. Table I
    Topology and spectrum availability A. Routing Among the nodes, assume the source
    node to be ‘M’ and the destination node to be ‘J’. Fig. 5 shows all the possible
    shortest paths from ‘M’ to ‘J’ formed using the algorithm. Fig. 6 indicates the
    default path with minimum adjacent link interference which is used for traffic
    flow. Fig. 5. Topology showing multiple paths. Show All Fig. 6. Topology showing
    default route. Show All B. Route Repairing It is presumed in the simulation that
    a single packet is sent in a time slot. Accordingly, all the trickle parameters
    are estimated before the execution starts. To understand the local repair operation,
    assume that the channel ‘magenta’ becomes unavailable during the data transmission.
    Channel ‘magenta’ forms the route between the nodes, ‘M’ and ‘H’. It gets replaced
    by another channel ‘black’ which is common between these nodes through local repair
    as shown in Fig. 7. Now assume that the channel ‘black’ becomes unavailable during
    the data transmission. Channel ‘black’ forms the route between the nodes, ‘F’
    and ‘T’. Local repair takes place here by choosing an existing alternate path
    as the default route which is shown in Fig. 8 (it may not satisfy the interference
    criteria mandatorily). Fig. 7. Locally repaired route with alternate channel Show
    All Now to understand the global repair operation, assume that the channel ‘red’
    becomes unavailable during the data transmission. Channel ‘red’ forms the route
    between the nodes, ‘T’ and ‘R’ and ‘N’ and ‘J’. Between ‘J’ and ‘N’, an alternate
    channel, ‘green’ could be found through sensing to continue the transmission.
    But between ‘T’ and ‘R’, local repair cannot find a channel or an alternate path
    to continue transmission. In such a case, global repair occurs. When such a repair
    occurs, it is assumed that the topology changes as the CR users are mobile and
    complete rerouting occurs with an upgraded version of DIO. The new route formed
    after the global repair operation is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 8. Locally repaired
    route with alternate path. Show All Fig. 9. New route after the global repair.
    Show All C. Performance Analysis In this design, routing is performed through
    the transmission of a number of control packets. It is imperative to bound the
    control plane overhead [8]. It is made possible by the use of trickle timers by
    eliminating the redundant messages. Fig. 10 shows the data and control packet
    comparison for each node in normal routing and data transmission conditions with
    zero link outage. It is clear from the result that the control packet overhead
    is negligible when compared to the data packets being transmitted through the
    nodes. Fig. 10. Data and control packet flow comparison. Show All Various conditions
    may occur in the network during transmission. Fig. 11 shows the comparison of
    control plane overhead under different conditions. It is well defined from the
    figure that the control plane overhead is the maximum through the network when
    the global repair occurs. When a local repair occurs by finding the alternate
    path, there is an increase in control plane overhead due to the extra flow of
    DIS messages to retrieve DIO from nodes in alternate path. Fig. 11. Control packet
    overhead under different routing conditions. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In
    this paper, a new routing algorithm based on the protocol, RPL, is being introduced
    into the CRN scenario. It is found that CRs being smart, RPL could be effectively
    implemented in a CRN. It supports the cross layer design which is widely accepted
    as an effective CRN routing solution. This paper implements RPL using very simple
    routing metrics and constraints. RPL is flexible enough to allow the designer
    to use any metric based on the network requirement. An efficient route repairing
    algorithm is also implemented in this paper. Simulation results show that the
    control packet overhead is very negligible compared to the flow of traffic. Overall,
    RPL is found to be a suitable routing protocol that can be carried out into the
    real CRN scenario. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

  title: Cross layer routing design based on RPL for multi-hop cognitive radio networks
  verbatim_quote1: In this paper, an effective routing solution with a cross layer
    design is proposed for the multi-hop CRNs. Most of the existing work uses Ad-hoc
    On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol as the routing protocol for CRNs. In
    this work, a novel routing algorithm based on Routing Protocol for Low power and
    lossy networks (RPL) is being proposed for the CRNs.
  verbatim_quote2: Routing is accomplished through the formation of colored Destination
    Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) of which the link frequencies are represented
    using colors. Hop count and adjacent link interference are counted as the routing
    metrics. Dynamic spectrum allocation is also done along with routing with the
    help of RPL.

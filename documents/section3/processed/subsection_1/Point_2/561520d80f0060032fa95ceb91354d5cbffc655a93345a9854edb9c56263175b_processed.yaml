  analysis: This paper presents a framework to integrate trust metrics into the IoT
    data cycle for real-time data quality assessment. The authors propose a mechanism
    to facilitate end-user parameterization of a trust metric tailoring its use in
    the proposed framework. They argue that trust is a well-established metric that
    has been used to determine the validity of data in crowd-sourced or other unreliable
    data collection techniques, such as that in IoT. The framework incorporates additional
    benefits, such as eliminating the requirement for a gold standard and providing
    visibility into data quality assessment throughout the big data model. To qualify
    the use of trust as a measure of quality, the authors conduct an experiment using
    data collected from an IoT deployment of sensors to measure air quality, in which
    low-cost sensors were colocated with a gold standard reference sensor. The calculated
    trust metric is compared with two well-understood metrics for data quality, root
    mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). A strong correlation
    between the trust metric and the comparison metrics shows that trust may be used
    as an indicative quality metric for data quality.

    Continued development of communication technologies has led to widespread Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) integration into various domains, including health, manufacturing, automotive,
    and precision agriculture. This has further led to the increased sharing of data
    among such domains to foster innovation. Most of these IoT deployments, however,
    are based on heterogeneous, pervasive sensors, which can lead to quality issues
    in the recorded data. This can lead to sharing of inaccurate or inconsistent data.
    There is a significant need to assess the quality of the collected data, should
    it be shared with multiple application domains, as inconsistencies in the data
    could have financial or health ramifications. This article builds on the recent
    research on trust metrics and presents a framework to integrate such metrics into
    the IoT data cycle for real-time data quality assessment. Critically, this article
    adopts a mechanism to facilitate end-user parameterization of a trust metric tailoring
    its use in the framework. Trust is a well-established metric that has been used
    to determine the validity of a piece or source of data in crowd-sourced or other
    unreliable data collection techniques such as that in IoT. The article further
    discusses how the trust-based framework eliminates the requirement for a gold
    standard and provides visibility into data quality assessment throughout the big
    data model. To qualify the use of trust as a measure of quality, an experiment
    is conducted using data collected from an IoT deployment of sensors to measure
    air quality in which low-cost sensors were colocated with a gold standard reference
    sensor. The calculated trust metric is compared with two well-understood metrics
    for data quality, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
    A strong correlation between the trust metric and the comparison metrics shows
    that trust may be used as an indicative quality metric for data quality. The metric

    I. Introduction The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has seen tremendous growth
    in the industry in the last five years. The number of connected devices in various
    sectors has also grown. This has, in turn, led to an increase in the amount of
    data generated and consumed. This exponential increase in data collected and consumed
    led to the IoT big data wave. This is characterized by volume, velocity, variety,
    veracity, and value, the 5V’s of big data as they are known [1]. As this data
    is collected, it must undergo several stages from collection to decision-making.
    These stages form the big data model. The big data model is a series of stages
    that the data must undergo from when it is created to when it is used. Each preceding
    stage is critical for the success of the next stage. Fig. 1 shows the various
    stages of the big data model. Data collection, data preprocessing, data processing,
    and data use are separate stages of the big data model. It is beneficial to interrogate
    data quality independently at each stage in the model. It can also be argued,
    however, that data quality should be reviewed longitudinally through the model
    for a given input and use case. For each stage, data can have different properties,
    and therefore, data quality has to be assessed separately but also represented
    differently. This is equally true for different data users and applications within
    the IoT ecosystem. Fig. 1. Big data model. Show All The data generated and consumed
    within IoT comes from several domains including, but not limited, to: 1) smart
    homes; 2) smart cities; 3) manufacturing; and 4) automotive to environmental sensing.
    Current discussions introduce the opportunities that sharing and consuming data
    across such domains of the IoT ecosystem would have for further innovation in
    the IoT space. This sharing of data across multiple domain spaces is referred
    to as data-shared IoT [2]. The example in Fig. 2 shows how a smart city application
    can benefit from data fusion of its own data with data from other IoT applications
    for better insights. For this fusion to be fruitful, it is important to ensure
    that the shared data conform to certain quality standards and can be trusted by
    the consuming application. Fig. 2. Shared IoT ecosystem. Show All This article
    presents a mechanism that aims to achieve the following objectives: 1) tailor
    assessment as per user requirements; 2) decouple metrics from the evaluation strategy;
    and 3) allow for longitudinal fusion of quality scores. Achieving these aims comes
    with challenges associated with them. Here, the aims are explained, and in Section
    IV, the challenges are highlighted. Decoupling the mechanics of providing a quality
    score from the means of evaluating the quality. The big data cycle (BDC) has various
    stages that data must undergo. At each stage, the data can have different quality
    issues. To determine and address data quality issues, it is beneficial to assess
    quality at each stage considering only the data properties at that stage. The
    ability to map data quality to the individual stage of the BDC will be referred
    to as the mechanics of providing or advertising quality. This can be separated
    from the metric used to evaluate the quality. This article uses a trust metric
    to provide a quality score, however, the mechanism can be applied to other quality
    metrics. This is illustrated in Section VII where each trust stage is decoupled
    and integrated into the BDC. This separation is useful to achieve a domain and
    use-case-agnostic solution. Each unique domain and use case can define its own
    metric for calculating a quality score without affecting the mechanics of applying
    quality assessment or advertising quality. Furthermore, when the quality requirements
    of an application change, the metric of assessing quality can be customized to
    that application’s needs without affecting, or needing to change the underlying
    mechanics of assessment. Longitudinal fusion of data quality defines a means to
    combine the various quality scores from each stage of the BDC into a single score
    that is representative of the end-to- end processes that the data has undergone.
    This process should be independent of the metric of assessing quality. Any fusion
    technique can be used here. In Section VIII, a naive fusion approach was used
    to distinguish between a low-quality stream and a gold reference stream. The intention,
    however, is to investigate more advanced fusion techniques. A tangible link between
    data quality, data quality types, and their effect on data through the stages
    of the BDC has been demonstrated [2]. This concept, however, is yet to be implemented.
    This describes the longitudinal relationship between the various data quality
    issues across the BDC. For example, knowing which data quality issues are present
    in the initial stages of the BDC (data preprocessing) and how this affects the
    next stage can help determine a data-processing technique in that stage. Data
    quality tailoring allows an application to customize quality assessment to suit
    its requirements. Quality itself is subjective and so should be evaluated as such.
    Data that is good for a particular application or use case might not be for the
    other. Each application should be able to define its own quality. For example,
    if data accuracy is important for a particular application and data latency (timeliness)
    is not, then the quality score should be customized to reflect that. This is illustrated
    by the use case in Section X, based on a custom data quality score, and each application
    can connect or disconnect from a data source. Current solutions aim to optimize
    quality assessment for a given use case [3], [4], [5], [6]. The resulting solutions,
    however, may not be applicable to another use case. Taleb et al. [7] described
    the importance of integrating quality assessment with the BDC, connecting quality
    assessment with the source of the quality issues. This approach, however, has
    not been implemented. This article presents a real-time end-to- end implementation
    of a data quality assessment framework that can be used to assess the quality
    of data in IoT deployments. The framework leverages trust as a means to assess
    quality where no reference or ground-truth data is available. Assessment of quality
    throughout the BDC allows identification of introduced quality issues at each
    stage. The framework is agnostic of the trust metric or fusion technique used;
    however, a trust metric presented in earlier work [2] is used in the implementation
    and testing. The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section II presents
    background information. Section III presents the state-of-the-art. Section IV
    details the existing challenges in implementing quality assessment in IoT environments.
    Section V presents the motivation for the proposed framework and highlights why
    trust is an important metric for the assessment of data quality in IoT. Section
    VI provides a detailed description of the framework including the mathematical
    formulation of the framework and microservice-based implementation of the solution.
    Section IX presents the testing environment, datasets employed, evaluation strategy,
    and results of the evaluation. Finally, Section XI presents the concluding remarks
    and future work. SECTION II. Background This section introduces three concepts
    that are central to this work: 1) data quality; 2) data quality dimensions (DQDs)
    and trust; and 3) their application within an IoT context. It then highlights
    the use of trust as a measure of quality. A. Data Quality Data collected from
    sensing IoT devices is of paramount importance today. Such data is being used
    to advance innovations and inform decision-making. Much of this data comes from
    low-cost sensor devices, which are inherently unreliable [8]. Assessing and ascertaining
    the quality of such data before using it is therefore important. Data quality
    has widely been studied in database management [9], [10], [11] and also in the
    big data context [12]. Poor data quality management can have adverse negative
    effects on business decisions [13]. Data quality is subjective, making it dependent
    on the use case and domain area. It has been defined differently in academic and
    industrial contexts [14]. Sidi et al. [3] defined data quality based on how appropriate
    it is for use based on user need. According to Heravizadeh et al. [15], quality
    means the totality of the characteristics of an entity (data) that bear on its
    ability to satisfy stated and implied needs. B. Data Quality Dimensions DQDs provide
    an acceptable way to measure data quality. Several authors have defined different
    DQD, each with associated metrics [14]. A DQD is a characteristic or feature of
    information for classifying information and data requirements. As such, it offers
    a way for measuring and managing data quality as well as information [3]. It is
    important to note that there is no standard definition of DQD that is acceptable
    as domain-independent [16]. It is argued that some of these could be task-independent,
    and therefore not restrained by the context of application while others are task-dependent
    [17]. In Lee et al. [18], many of these were studied and later summarized them
    into four main categories as shown in Table I. TABLE I DQD Categories C. Trust
    Trust can be defined as the belief of a trustor in a trustee that the trustee
    will accomplish a given task by satisfying the trustor’s expectation [16]. Different
    users have different requirements that must be satisfied before they can trust
    a source. Examples of these can relate to DQDs including reliability, competence,
    credentials, and reputation. In the era where information is widely available,
    users are tasked with gauging the quality of such. From the trust perspective,
    a data source can build a reputation over time to become trustworthy. Trust in
    itself is a process, and therefore trust can be formed, improved, and also lost.
    Some data sources have built trust over time and now they are more trusted than
    others. Trust has been widely used in other areas. In service computing, Malik
    and Bouguettaya [19] and Chang et al. [20] used trust to select the best service
    for a user. Jøsang et al. [21] proposed systems that could be used to derive measures
    of trust and reputation for Internet transactions. D. Trust as a Measure of Data
    Quality In a wider sense, trust has been used as a measure of quality, especially
    in information systems. It is assumed that if more people trust a product or service,
    it has better quality and vice versa. This same principle has been used widely
    in information search on the Internet and more recently in recommender engines
    [22]. Like trust, quality is an iterative process that must be constantly reassessed.
    To achieve a level of trustworthiness, different trust attributes must be evaluated
    at every stage and how these contribute to each other. The uniqueness of trust
    as a metric for data quality assessment lies in its properties. Byabazaire et
    al. [23] highlights these properties and how each can be used to harness trust
    as data quality metrics, especially in data-shared IoT scenarios. For example,
    trust is personalizable. In IoT, each application has a unique description of
    data quality. SECTION III. State-of-the-Art Several solutions have been proposed
    to help ensure that data retain its quality within database management and a few
    in the context of IoT and big data. While data quality assessment in a general
    context can be considered a mature field of study, data quality assessment in
    the context of IoT has not yet been fully explored [24]. There are several methods
    to ensure data retains its quality. This Section contrasts two approaches to data
    quality assessment that relate to this work. The first approach aims to develop
    DQDs that can be used by domain experts to assess data quality both generally,
    and in the context of IoT. The other approach aims to take these DQDs and develop
    solutions that automate the process of assessing and improving data quality. A.
    Development of DQDs DQDs offer a way for measuring and managing data quality as
    well as information [25]. More precisely, DQDs describe the various measurable
    metrics of data quality. The main aim of the solutions is to define new DQDs and
    evaluate them based on expert opinion. The data quality assessments framework
    based on DQDs date back to 1998. Total Data Quality Management (TDQM) by Wang
    [27] has been widely accepted within database management systems [28], [29] and
    within big data and IoT systems [30], [31], [32]. One of its core advantages is
    that it emphasizes an iterative approach to data quality management. Data users
    specify their requirements, and data engineers (information product engineers)
    translate these into DQDs that are measurable. Finally, expert knowledge is used
    to validate the requirements against the output of the engineers. Their implementation
    proposes 15 DQDs that can be applied to various domains and have been widely adopted.
    The evaluation of the framework is based on domain expert knowledge. Lee et al.
    [18] later proposed AIM quality (AIMQ) that is based on TDQM. The major contribution
    of this work classifies DQDs into four categories: 1) intrinsic; 2) contextual;
    3) representational; and 4) accessibility. Several other methodologies have also
    been proposed based on TDQM. While the solutions above are more general, more
    recently, Alrae et al. [33] proposed “House of Information Quality framework for
    IoT systems.” This differs from the above solutions in that it compares DQDs associated
    with information quality and the core IoT elements to define DQDs that are necessary
    for IoT applications. Like the above solutions, expert opinion is used as a significant
    validation method. This is a good validation strategy, but not good for runtime
    assessment. B. Application of DQDs This section highlights solutions that use
    DQDs to implement applications for assessing and improving that quality. In these,
    some have advanced a data-centric approach by trying to mitigate the errors in
    the data itself [34], [35], [36], and others have proposed a process-centric approach
    where the data collection process is assessed [3], [4], [5], [6]. Javed and Wolf
    [36] presented a technique that leverages spatial and temporal interpolation to
    identify outliers in sensor reading. They evaluate their solution using weather
    sensing and conclude that the same method can be used in any application domain
    where the underlying phenomenon is continuous. Tsai et al. [34] proposed an abnormal
    sensor detection architecture that leverages machine-learning techniques, using
    a trained Bayesian model that can predict values of sensor nodes via other correlated
    sensors. Their results show they can detect abnormal sensors in real-time. Vilenski
    et al. [35] looked at a multivariate anomaly detection technique for ensuring
    the data quality of dendrometer sensor networks. The anomalous sensors are identified
    statistically by comparing a sensor’s readings to an expected reading from a similar,
    healthy sensor network. As a gold standard, expert knowledge was used to assess
    the system. The above solutions address a single DQD (accuracy) by employing anomaly
    detection techniques. Contrary to the above, Kim et al. [37] used accurate and
    consistent DQDs and proposed a system for filtering data based on the sensing
    objects. By employing a Bayesian classifier, the classifier can filter sensing
    objects with inaccurate data and then deliver data with integrity to the server
    for analysis. The performance of the proposed data-filtering system is evaluated
    through computer simulation. This research identifies the necessity of addressing
    multiple DQDs and directs the work in this article for a general framework to
    apply multiple DQDs in assessment, with those DQDs specified by the end user.
    Current approaches are evaluated by either expert knowledge (Section III-A), by
    a unique process (Section III-B), or by bespoke gold standard reference measure
    for a given use case. The evaluation strategy is thus specific to the use case.
    Identifying a means to evaluate data quality assessment strategy via a benchmark
    remains an open challenge. Table II compares some of the previous research and
    the evaluation strategies used against the proposed approach. TABLE II Comparison
    of the Various Evaluation Strategies SECTION IV. Existing Challenges The approach
    to data quality assessment in this article is to investigate how the aspects of
    data quality affect the performance of each stage in the big data model and how
    this affects subsequent stages. To understand how data quality assessment proliferates
    and affects data use cases, it is essential to understand the relationship between
    data quality and the big data model. Thus far, the literature does not consider
    data quality as a fundamental aspect of the big data model. A challenge exists
    with regard to structuring DQDs within the big data model so that the effect of
    data quality is identified throughout the model. Currently, it is difficult to
    know which part of the big data model is responsible for what portion of the overall
    data quality score. These are referred to as structure-related challenges [2].
    With a given data quality structure in mind, considerations on how data quality
    measurements from one stage of the big data model can and should affect data quality
    measurements at other stages in the big data model. This may involve combining
    or weighting quality measurements for a given stage or use case. A number of challenges
    exist in this space and are referred to as method-related challenges. Implementing
    a given assessment structure and methodology into a data pipeline from end to
    end considering the uniqueness of each stage of the BDC remains a challenge. These
    are referred to as implementation challenges. A. Method-Related Challenges Data
    quality can be highly subjective. A single data point or source can have varying
    qualities depending on the use-case context. How might data quality be represented
    in a general manner throughout the big data model yet allow subjective assessment
    by two (or more) end users? Data quality is measured and represented in different
    forms depending on the stage and context within the big data model. How can these
    data quality measures be combined across the big data model stages to infer a
    quality metric which is useful for use-case quality determination? This article
    addresses these challenges by providing a means of decoupling the mechanics of
    providing a quality score and the methods of evaluating quality. B. Implementation-Related
    Challenges The current implementation of data collection/processing solutions
    for IoT and big data are based on a data pipeline. The BDC is broken down into
    a set of defined individual and independent services. For a data assessment solution
    to be feasible, it should be integrated into such data pipelines. Challenges exist
    in choosing the significant stages in the pipeline where data should be evaluated.
    Other challenges include, fusing different scores from independent stages of the
    data pipeline into a single score that can be used and advertised to applications.
    This would help explain the interrelationship of the various stages of the BDC
    and data quality issues. This article implements a naive approach of considering
    all the scores equally, but the goal is to investigate other fusion techniques.
    SECTION V. Rationale for Trust This section serves and provides the motivation
    for introducing trust as a driver for data quality measurement and incorporating
    data quality into the big data model. Trust has been used previously as a measure
    of data quality. Keßler and De Groot [38] studied how the quality of geographic
    information can be estimated through the notion of trust as a proxy measure. Trust
    is a unitless measure that can be used in composite metrics. A trust score can
    be used to represent the composite score of a chosen number of DQDs used to assess
    quality while representing a competitive score evaluating two (or more) sources.
    Moreover, trust based on previous events can help minimize the required processing
    time for real-time applications. Trust is expressed using the experience metric
    in the implementation of this article. Experience (e): Data quality is currently
    measured by evaluating over a period of data points and determining a quality
    score for an instance over this period. Real-time subscriptions to data streams
    are concerned with current data quality at the head of the stream. Assessing this
    quality over a period, up to the head of the stream can be expensive. Furthermore,
    this quality measure will age, requiring reevaluation. This article presents an
    experience metric (e) , based on a trust paradigm, which can be used to continuously
    assess quality at the head of a data stream with low overhead. Experience is modeled
    on the following properties of trust. Dynamic: Trust can increase or decrease
    with new experiences (usage or interactions). This feature has been modeled through
    different techniques. For example, in PeerTrust [39], they use an iterative windowing
    approach which allows users to customize the overall trust score by varying past
    and present experiences of an actor. In this article, the defined generic experience
    metric provides an innovative way to allow a data stream/data provider to build
    trust over time. This is different from the current data quality evaluation strategies
    that, while considering historical data, return an instantaneous metric. Personalized:
    This allows each data agent/consumer to customize its own trust metric by either
    assigning different weights to the metric or defining its own experience metric.
    This provides an innovative way to assess data quality based on the specifications
    of the data consumer. SECTION VI. Proposed Framework The framework is based on
    the properties of trust that can be improved over time to indicate good quality
    data whose quality threshold is acceptable for a certain use case. Trust itself
    is a continuous assessment process. Throughout this process, trust can be formed,
    improved, or lost. This article defines three trust stages for evaluating data
    quality. This was informed by previous research in the field [4]. Fig. 3 shows
    how these relate to the big data model. Initial trust: This is trust that is derived
    without investigating the data itself but rather the context of the data. This
    includes investigating the source and equipment/sensors used, and metadata are
    also assessed. Metadata plays a key role in determining quality. Sensor types,
    manufacturer, deployment age, and calibration technique are features that affect
    data quality. Investigation trust: Trust that is derived from the data itself.
    This can relate to the raw data stream or stages of preprocessing the data has
    undertaken. This, among other parameters, can encompass data completeness or accuracy.
    A component of this can consider comparative analysis, comparing the data stream
    values against a community of sensors or comparative data streams. Stages of preprocessing
    may involve data stream modeling or data fusion. Both modeling and fused data
    can be used and evaluated in comparative analysis for trust determination. Result-driven
    trust: Data are used in systems modeling and decision-making. The result of these
    products can be monitored as effective decisions or accurate models. This monitored
    result can be used as a feedback mechanism throughout the stages of the big data
    model to build trust. This relates to the propagative property of trust [40].
    The result-driven feedback is an important facet to build trust in the absence
    of a gold standard and in a shared data environment. Fig. 3. Flow diagram showing
    the relationship between the big data model and trust formation stages. Show All
    The initial trust would help us define a trust score that represents data quality
    during data collection. Investigative trust defines a trust score that represents
    data quality during data prepossessing and data analytics. Finally, result-driven
    trust defines a trust score that represents data quality during data analytics
    and other data use processes. This ensures that data quality is represented across
    the entire big data model. A proposed data quality assessment framework is shown
    in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Proposed framework that is based on trust formation stage.
    Show All The framework defines three phases: 1) starting phase (SP); 2) investigation
    phase (IP); and 3) results phase (RP). These are explained further in Section
    VI-C. At each of the phases, a phase trust score is calculated; SP n , IP n ,
    RP n by combining parameters and weights. For example, SP (SPn) is calculated
    with parameters ( a 1 , a 2 ,…, a 3 ) and weights ( w 1 , w 2 ,…, w 3 ) . Table
    III presents a nonexhaustive list of parameters. This is completed for each of
    the phases with the respective parameters and weights. After determining a phase
    trust score, a use-case-specific threshold is defined. Such weights can be learned
    through feedback from the previous stage for a particular use case. This is used
    to model the effects of the phases on each other. The framework then combines
    these with the experience metric and outputs a single end-to-end trust metric
    that can be used to evaluate data quality. TABLE III Parameters at Each Phase
    A. Framework Phases Three phases are defined that relate to the trust formation
    process. First, the framework will evaluate the context of the data by looking
    at aspects of the data; origin of data (reputation of the source), metadata. Second,
    the framework examines the data itself, assessing quality issues that exist in
    the data. Finally, the framework assesses use-case-specific results and their
    applicability to data quality. A predictive model use case may compare real and
    predicted values and attribute trust based on this. At each phase, the framework
    defines parameters a 1 to a n that define the dimensions of data quality used
    at each stage. B. Determining Weights The framework applies a set of linear weights
    to the attributes at each stage. The weights can be learned through the feedback
    process from the previous stage. This ensures that each use case can uniquely
    customize its own quality experience. C. Formulation of the Trust Metric The mathematical
    definition of SP, IP, and RP is illustrated further in Section VIII-B. The trust
    score of a data stream i is defined as T i = SP i + IP i + RP i +e (1) View Source
    where e is a metric called experience defined below. 1) Experience ( e ) The proposed
    framework uses experience e to model the natural behavior of trust. This is motivated
    by work conducted by Gao et al. [41]. The experience score is driven by positive
    and negative experiences. Therefore, the metric e of a given data stream i is
    defined as e i = ϑ i +1 ϑ i + δ i +2 (2) View Source where ϑ i is the count of
    positive experience toward data stream i , and δ i is the count of negative experience
    toward data stream i . Consider a data stream i , it is said to have positive
    e at time t if the trust score at time t−1 is greater than a threshold, else i
    shows a negative experience. At t=0 , ( ϑ i + δ i =0) , this means that data stream
    is new or has just started streaming. Therefore, experience is set to e i =0.5
    . This is informed by previous research in the field [42]. SECTION VII. End-to-End
    Implementation The proposed framework is tested via an end-to- end implementation
    of the data pipeline that is based on industry standard technologies and practices.
    The application development follows a microservice-based architecture that decomposes
    the application into a small set of complete self-contained services. This ensures
    that the framework can be seamlessly designed into any pipeline. This implementation
    aims to achieve the following goals. Decouple the mechanics of providing or advertising
    a quality score from the methods of evaluating quality. This allows different,
    competing, or updated metrics to be used to calculate trust without affecting
    the scoring mechanism. Describe the placement of the trust framework into big
    data pipelines. Evaluate the feasibility of end-to-end data quality assessment
    in terms of computing resources. The end-to-end data pipeline shown in Fig. 5
    is composed of four system components: these are mapped from the four phases of
    the big data phases described in Section I. This section describes the role of
    each component and the technologies used in each. Fig. 5. End-to-end implementation
    of the data pipeline. Show All A. Data Collection This phase of the data pipeline
    is concerned with data producers or data sources. These could be live sensors
    streaming to the cloud, historical data coming from a data warehouse/database,
    or data coming from a third-party application programming interface (API). Both
    live stream and historical data sources (batch processing) were considered for
    testing and evaluation. B. Data Preprocessing Two operations take place in the
    preprocessing block; first, the calculation of the initial trust described in
    Section VI as part of the trust framework is applied. The system checks if the
    initial trust meets this stage’s application data quality requirements. If satisfied,
    each data stream is tagged as good data and passed on to a Kafka node. Otherwise,
    that data can be tagged as usable data. In this case, the data can be improved
    by subsequent processing, and else, the data is discarded. Deciding what constitutes
    usable data is still an open research question. Second, a producer–broker–consumer
    mechanism is set up to receive data from the data producers (sensors). This in
    turn will present the data to the next part of the data pipeline (consumer). In
    a typical IoT data-shared environment, it is expected that a single data source
    can share its data with one or several data consumers each with different data
    quality requirements. The need for parallel distributed processing where a single
    input data source can be processed independently by each application is supported
    by Kafka and Zookeeper. Kafka, a distributed messaging system that is used for
    collecting and delivering high volumes of data with low latency [43]. Zookeeper
    is an orchestration server for Kafka. Fig. 6 shows the high-level architecture
    of Kafka. In the proposed system, each data consumer (spark application, described
    in Section VII-C) initializes a Kafka topic. This is the name of the source(s)
    from which it expects to receive data. A single application can subscribe to one
    or many Kafka topics. Each data source can only publish a single topic. Both Kafka
    and Zookeeper are run as microservices running on docker containers. The system
    can scale both horizontally and vertically. Fig. 6. Distributed Kafka architecture.
    Show All C. Data Processing and Analytics Data processing, real-time modeling,
    and data storage are performed by the data processing and analytics cluster. The
    second phase of trust calculation is conducted in this system component. To achieve
    the functionality of this subcomponent, the data needs to be processed in real-time
    as it is received. A spark streaming service is used to handle real-time data.
    Spark streaming is part of the core spark API that allows for real-time processing
    of data from various sources including Kafka, Flume, and Amazon Kinesis. This
    processed data can then be saved to file systems, databases, live dashboards,
    or even pushed to a Kafka node as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Spark streaming application.
    Show All The setup consists of one master node with two workers. Each spark application
    is initialized with a list of topics to which it listens. Each topic corresponds
    to a data source name that is part of the IoT data-sharing ecosystem. Both historical
    and real-time data can be assessed using this implementation. Historical data
    can be assessed in batches defined by a period. Real-time data is assessed on
    a continuous basis windowed by a period or sample size. The following operations
    take place using the calculated trust score. The trust score from the previous
    phase is aggregated with that of the current phase. If the trust score is lower
    than a threshold, operations can be performed here to improve the overall quality
    and a new trust score calculated. If the data does not meet the quality standards
    of the application, the current data source will be deemed unusable. D. Data Use
    The final component of the data pipeline considers data use. Data use operations
    such as data visualization and machine learning are typically applied in the BDC.
    RP trust is calculated based on the output of such operations. This requires feedback
    from the application. The feedback loop would help define the longitudinal relationship
    between the data quality properties at each stage of the big data model, and how
    these might affect or help improve the overall data quality of a data stream.
    For example, a prediction model application may return a prediction error based
    on the current data pipeline used. SECTION VIII. Trust Framework by Example To
    demonstrate the application of the proposed system, an example based on a dataset
    from an IoT deployment collected to measure air quality was used. The air quality
    dataset is comprised of two data streams: a gold reference sensor stream and an
    IoT sensor stream. Both are colocated and measure the same feature (carbon monoxide
    (CO) concentration). From each of these streams, a continuous trust metric is
    formed. The trust metric is built using three DQDs: 1) accuracy; 2) completeness;
    and 3) timeliness. The implementation of each of the metrics is defined in Section
    VIII-B. At any given time, a value of trust is given to the stream based on these
    DQDs and past trust scores (experience). The example is presented to, first, provide
    an implementation of trust and show the dynamics of the trust metric when evaluating
    a data stream, and second, to test and validate the trust mechanism. This is achieved
    in three stages. First, the trust metric of the known gold standard data stream
    is compared against the trust metric for colocated IoT data stream. This test
    indicates how trust can be used as a metric over multiple DQDs to differentiate
    between sources of varying quality. Second, trust is compared to known data quality
    metrics MAE and RMSE. The comparison will validate trust as an indicator of data
    quality. Should the defined trust metric show a strong correlation with the known
    data quality metrics over a range of data streams, we may conclude that the trust
    metric can indeed be a usable quality metric. Finally, the resource costs of implementing
    trust as a continuous quality metric are evaluated. The first evaluation is based
    on data from a CO sensor (referred to as the low-cost sensor) and a gold reference
    sensor. These are colocated and measure the same property. For each stream, DQDs
    at each stage are defined. These are used to calculate the trust score and subsequently
    experience for each stage. Finally, result scores from the initial and investigative
    stages are fused, resulting in a trust score for a stream. A naive approach using
    equal weighting linear fusion is applied in this example. Further investigation
    into fusion techniques will be conducted in future work. A second evaluation is
    based on the gold reference stream. The goal is to have a standard and generic
    way of evaluating data quality frameworks that are based on model performance.
    Models are usually the final step of most IoT data processes, and the previous
    research has shown a correlation between data quality and model performance [44].
    This can help establish a benchmark for all data quality frameworks across the
    IoT. The stream is modeled to generate five streams. The first stream is the original
    stream (no noise added). The other five streams are generated by randomly introducing
    noise to the original stream in varying proportions of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30%.
    The percentage is the overall size of the data stream. To generate the noise,
    NumPy’s random function was used [45]. This is based on the normal distribution
    and draws random samples. The size of the sample corresponds to the proportion
    of error, for example, 10%. The generated noise is then added to the original
    stream to create a new stream. For each stream, a trust metric is calculated.
    For each stream, a model is built and evaluated with two known metrics: 1) RMSE
    and 2) MAE. The framework is agnostic of the modeling technique. This example
    uses an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). A relationship exists
    between data quality and model performance [44]. As the data quality degrades,
    so does model performance, keeping other factors constant. This relationship is
    used as a way to evaluate the trust metric. If this relationship exists between
    the calculated trust metric and data quality, it can be concluded that the trust
    metric is a valid metric for describing data quality. Fig. 8 summarizes the data
    and process flow of the example. Fig. 8. Data and process flow of the example.
    Show All The final evaluation measures how the system resources are utilized as
    the data go through the data pipeline. Central processing unit (CPU) utilization
    of the system without the trust calculation and CPU utilization with the calculation
    of trust at each stage are compared. The delay introduced by trust calculation
    is also measured. The results and evaluations reported in is study are based on
    the starting and investigation phases of the framework highlighted in Fig. 4.
    The mechanism for the RP is still under study. In the SP, one DQD is considered,
    timeliness, and two DQDs in the IP, completeness and accuracy. To differ from
    previous studies that use the same DQDs by taking into account only the current
    state of a data stream, our implementation uses a trust approach based on past
    and present experience. Karkouch et al. [46] reported that because of the instantaneous
    nature of these DQDs, at some point, they will be either unreliable or become
    insignificant. For example, if a sensor dirty fails (sensor node fails, but keeps
    up reporting readings that are erroneous) under any circumstances, then the accuracy
    dimension is rendered insignificant and unreliable unless it is enhanced with
    past experience. These metrics are defined in Section VI-C. This implementation
    considers uniform weights for each DQD. Effective weight determination is still
    an open research question. A. Dataset Description The study uses a publicly available
    dataset that was collected from an IoT deployment (see reference [47]). A multisensor
    device was colocated with a conventional air pollution analyzer. This was used
    to provide the true concentration values of the target pollutants at the measurement
    site. These values were thus used as a gold standard. This dataset is suitable
    for testing as the discrepancies in quality between the streams are known and
    can be used for system evaluation. This study uses data from the CO sensor (referred
    to as a low-cost sensor) and the gold reference sensor. Fig. 9 shows hourly concentration
    estimation of CO over a one-week window. The red line represents the true concentration
    value as measured by the conventional analyzer colocated with the low-cost sensor
    whose values are shown by the blue line. Fig. 9. Hourly concentration measures
    of CO for the gold standard and low-cost sensors. Show All B. Mathematical Implementation
    A previous study [2] examines if a trust-based framework can be used to evaluate
    the quality of a data stream without a gold reference. This study expands on this
    to consider the first two phases (SP and IP) of the framework. This work is different
    from the previous study in that it implements evaluation over the big data model,
    evaluating a fundamental component of the proposed framework. The implementation
    and evaluation are conducted over two phases using: 1) timeliness and 2) accuracy
    and completeness DQDs. Following from (1), SPi and IPi are given by SP i = IP
    i = ( Timeliness )( w 1 ) ( Accuracy Completeness )( w 1 w 2 ). (3) (4) View Source
    1) Accuracy: This is widely considered as meaning a correct and unambiguous correspondence
    with the real world [48]. Ballou and Pazer [49] defined accuracy as the recorded
    value being in conformity with the actual value. This work defines the metric
    for accuracy following the definition by Blake and Mangiameli [48]: Accuracy:=1−
    V T N A (5) View Source where V T is the number of tuples in a relation having
    one or more incorrect values and N A is the total number of tuples. To determine
    V T , a statistical technique based on median absolute deviations (MADs) is used.
    Absolute deviation from the median has been used for a long time to filter outliers
    [50]. The median is a measure of central tendency and is preferred to the mean
    as it is less sensitive to the presence of outliers which can have an outsized
    effect in IoT. The median is also a location estimator that has the highest breakdown
    point. The following formula as defined by Huber [51] was used to calculate MAD:
    MAD=α M i (| x i − M j ( x j )|) (6) View Source where x j is the original observations,
    M j is the median of the series, and α is the data normalization constant defined
    by [52]. It is defined as α=(1/(Q(0.75)) , where Q(0.75) is the 0.75 quintile
    of that underlying distribution. The normalization step is important because otherwise
    MAD would estimate the scale up to a multiplicative constant [51] only. Fig. 10
    illustrates how the MAD was used to determine V T . To determine the tolerance
    factor, Miller [53] suggested three values: 2, 2.5, and 3 standard deviations.
    The choice will determine the sensitivity of the metric. Since IoT data is noisy,
    the extreme value of 3 was used to ensure that noisy data are not tagged as outliers.
    Fig. 10. Illustration of how MAD is implemented. Show All 2) Completeness: The
    metric for completeness is given by [48] and is defined as follows: on the level
    of data values, a data value is incomplete (i.e., the metric value is zero) if
    and only if it is “NULL”; otherwise, it is complete (i.e., the metric value is
    one). All data values that represent missing or unknown values in a specific application
    scenario (e.g., blank spaces or “9/9/9999” as a date value) are represented by
    the data value “NULL. ” For a relation R , let T R be the number of tuples in
    R that have at least one “NULL” value and let N R be the total number of tuples
    in R . Then, the completeness of R is defined as follows: Completeness:=1− T R
    N R = N R − T R N R . (7) View Source 3) Timeliness: The parameter for timelines
    of a data stream is affected by two components: currency, referring to the lag
    between when the data point was produced and when it was used or processed. The
    second, volatility, refers to how long the data point remains valid [54]. For
    some applications like accident avoidance in autonomous vehicles, this is very
    important. In others such as disease prediction in smart agriculture, the currency
    is less important. Unlike accuracy and completeness, timeliness is not determined
    directly from the data but rather by the context of the data. To this end, the
    metric for timelines is defined as Timeliness=[max(1− currency volatility ),0].
    (8) View Source C. Weighting the Scores Previous works [2] have two main drawbacks.
    Both previous and current experiences are weighted equally. The natural norm of
    trust assigns more weight to previous experiences when compared to current ones.
    The trust curve is biased by sudden changes in the data properties. The desired
    effect would be a gradual change for small changes in the data properties, with
    larger variations in trust occurring from larger data property changes. To mitigate
    the above effects, a weighted moving average that assigns more weight to past
    experiences when compared to current experiences is applied. This also reduces
    the effects of sudden increases and decreases in the trust curve due to small
    changes. Fig. 11 compares the trust score before and after weighting. The highlighted
    area shows how the effects of weights mitigate the above challenges. This is important
    in data-shared IoT where data is noisy and sudden changes in the data do not always
    relate to poor quality data. Fig. 11. Weighting trust scores using weighted moving
    average. Show All SECTION IX. Results and Evaluations To evaluate the trust metric,
    an experiment was set up to compare the trust metric to known statistical measures.
    The ARIMA forecasting model was used. Although multiple factors dictate a model’s
    performance, it is argued that the quality of the data that goes into the model
    is of most importance [44]. As the data quality changes, the assumption is that
    so does the model’s overall performance. Using the original gold reference stream,
    a trust score was calculated. Also, an ARIMA model is built and tested for the
    same stream. The results of the trust score are then compared to the RMSE and
    MAE. The process is repeated for the other generated streams. The correlation
    measures were based on the Pearson correlation coefficient. As it can be seen
    from both Table IV and Fig. 12, there is a strong negative correlation between
    the trust score and the RMSE and MAE. As the quality of the data degrades, the
    performance of the ARIMA model decreases. This is indicated by the increase in
    the values of RMSE and MAE. The same relationship exists between the trust score
    and data quality. As the quality of data degrades, so does the trust score. This
    shows that the proposed trust metric can act equivalently as known metrics like
    the RMSE. It is important to note that the trust metric is calculated without
    reference to a gold standard. This presents a significant opportunity to measure
    data quality in shared IoT where there is no gold reference to compare. TABLE
    IV Pearson Correlation Coefficients Between the Trust Score, RMSE, and MAE Fig.
    12. Comparing how the trust score, RMSE, and MAE changes in data impurities. Show
    All The metric for RMSE and MAE are solely based on the accuracy of DQDs. It was,
    therefore, not possible to evaluate how completeness and timeliness would affect
    such metrics. Trust metric, however, is a multidimensional metric that incorporates
    several DQDs depending on the user’s needs and application. This further illustrates
    the need for new ways to evaluate data quality. Future work will explore how to
    effectively compare the trust metric to other multidimensional metrics that support
    several DQDs. Fig. 13 presents the data quality differences between the gold reference
    sensor and the low-quality sensor. The aim here was to differentiate between two
    known data quality streams: 1) the gold reference and 2) the low-cost sensor.
    The green highlight in the Fig. 13 shows how both the gold reference and low-quality
    sensor’s trust decrease. During this period, the number of outliers increased
    by 2% for both the gold reference and low-quality sensors. The number of missing
    values, however, increased by 3% and 2% for gold reference and low-quality sensors,
    respectively. This accounts for the reduction in the trust scores for both sensors.
    Fig. 13. Comparing trust scores for the gold reference sensor and low-cost sensor.
    Show All In the first red highlight, there are inconsistencies in the trust scores
    for the gold reference and low-quality sensors, with that of the low-quality sensor
    being lower. During this period, the data authors [47] reported that after the
    30th week (starting march 2004), there was sensor drifting. This was later corrected
    by the calibration of the sensors. This sensor drift was detected by the trust
    mechanism and resulted in a lower trust score for this period. After calibration,
    the trust score returns to high values. The detection of sensor drift and its
    impact on data quality has previously shown to be difficult to measure. In the
    last red highlight, there was a 13% increase in the number of missing values for
    the low-quality sensor. This explains the overall decrease in the trust score
    during this period. The trust metric, therefore, helps describe the quality of
    each data stream independently without relying on the other and shows the effects
    of different DQDs in a single metric. This type of comparison over multiple DQDs
    is not possible with existing techniques. As part of the evaluation process, the
    impact of the trust computation framework on the data pipeline in terms of system
    resources (percentage CPU usage) and the delay introduced in the data pipeline
    due to trust calculation was monitored. Fig. 14 shows a higher percentage usage
    of compute resources for a data pipeline with trust computation when compared
    to the same job without trust computation. On average, there was a 7.8% increase
    in CPU usage for jobs with trust calculation. On average, there is a delay introduced
    into the data pipeline due to trust calculation. This is not an in- process delay,
    but rather compounded total delay from the start of the job to the end. Not with
    standing this the data is still delivered. The results reported here compare system
    performance as the number of nodes in the clusters increases (up to four worker
    nodes). Each of the worker’s nodes has six cores and 4 GB. As shown in Table V,
    as the number of worker nodes increases, the delay decreases from 10.6 to 4.2
    min. Since the delay is caused by an extra process (trust calculation), and spark
    is a distributed processing engine, increasing the number of nodes in the cluster
    would minimize or even eliminate such a delay. This demonstrates the scalability
    of the system. TABLE V System Resource Utilization Fig. 14. Comparing data pipeline
    resource consumption. Show All SECTION X. Application: When to Disconnect From
    a Data Source Data deriving from IoT can help foster innovations and save lives.
    Performing analytics on this data is, however, challenging due to the heterogeneity,
    complexity, and dynamic nature of IoT. Therefore, businesses and organizations
    have to maintain redundant data sources, seek third-party sources, or a few that
    can afford them, and install high-end sensors to mitigate such heterogeneity within
    the data. The process of deciding which data source to engage and disengage is
    largely based on the quality of data from such a source. This is typically performed
    manually after the data has been processed. Data generation, collection, and delivery
    in IoT are automated and so should the process of selecting and maintaining a
    data source. Current data quality metrics are instantaneous, that is, a data source
    is evaluated based on its current state only, without previous context. Given
    the dynamic, heterogeneity, and high volatility of IoT data, this would result
    in a high variance in network connection due to disconnecting from a data source
    each time there is a change in the data properties. This problem is exacerbated
    by low bandwidth and intermittent network disruptions that affect most IoT deployments.
    The trust metric, however, has been modeled to mitigate this problem. One of the
    novel elements of the trust score is its experience metric. This helps to incorporate
    the past and current context of a data source and also ensures that sudden changes
    in the data properties do not lead to sudden changes in the trust metric. This
    feature is further improved by the weighting strategy implemented in Section VIII-C.
    To illustrate the application, data collected from weather stations between 2015
    and 2019 in the United Kingdom was used. The data is produced at an interval of
    15 min. Each weather station generates an average of 30000 data points every year
    with over 100 weather stations. This includes air temperature, rainfall, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. Agricultural applications dynamically connect to and
    retrieve data from these stations. In a data-shared IoT environment, applications
    should be able to dynamically select a data source, a weather station, for example,
    based on its data quality needs. Figs. 15 and 16 show two applications each with
    a different trust score threshold (0.98 and 0.95), each connected to a different
    weather station. Each application would advertise its threshold. In each case,
    the application would then automatically disengage from the data source when its
    trust score falls below the application’s threshold and would automatically be
    connected to another data source of sufficient quality. While the thresholds determined
    in the figures are somewhat arbitrary, the method can be used to allow different
    applications to prescribe different levels of quality for their given use case.
    Each application and use case can set its own threshold. This can then be used
    to disengage from a data source. Fig. 15. Application with a higher threshold.
    Show All Fig. 16. Application with a lower threshold. Show All This kind of automation
    can be used in other applications, for example: Automate data source repairs and
    maintenance. Continued disengagement from a data source could mean it is faulty.
    Gradual decrease in data quality could be associated with sensor drift. Therefore,
    the sensor can be automatically reset back to where its known data quality was
    good. SECTION XI. Conclusion and Future Work This article has described an end-to-
    end implementation of a trust framework that can be used to estimate the quality
    of data. The implementation was evaluated using data collected from a real-world
    experiment. The implementation is based on industry-standard data pipelines with
    Kafka as distributed messaging service and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
    This is unique as it integrates with all the stages of the big data model. To
    the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end data quality assessment
    framework implementation. This implementation enables one to estimate data quality
    in cases where there is no gold standard to compare. The other advantage is that
    one would be able to represent data quality in a general manner throughout the
    big data model. To evaluate the system, the article compares the trust score to
    RMSE and MAE. Using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, the results and evaluations
    showed that the trust metric is a good metric for data quality assessment in cases
    where there is no gold standard, which is the case in data-shared IoT. Although
    the results have shown a slight increase in system resources in terms of CPU and
    execution time, this can be mitigated with distributed processing. The article
    listed several challenges related to data quality assessment, both structural
    and method-related challenges. We have explored how some of these can be solved
    by the implementation described using real-world datasets. However, some challenges
    remain: for example, we equally combine the trust scores for the different phases.
    There is a need for a fusion algorithm that accounts for the contribution of each
    stage. Also, the mechanism for feedback and how this propagates from the RP is
    not yet fully formed. These and other challenges highlighted above form part of
    our future work. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    \ managers call for cost-effective and innovative solutions to handle a wide variety\
    \ of\nenvironmental problems that threaten biodiversity in protected areas. Recently,\
    \ drones have been\ncalled upon to revolutionize conservation and hold great potential\
    \ to evolve and raise better-informed\ndecisions to assist management. Despite\
    \ great expectations, the beneﬁts that drones could bring\nto foster effectiveness\
    \ remain fundamentally unexplored. To address this gap, we performed a\nliterature\
    \ review about the use of drones in conservation. We selected a total of 256 studies,\
    \ of\nwhich 99 were carried out in protected areas. We classiﬁed the studies in\
    \ ﬁve distinct areas of\napplications: “wildlife monitoring and management”; “ecosystem\
    \ monitoring”; “law enforcement”;\n“ecotourism”; and “environmental management\
    \ and disaster response”. We also identiﬁed speciﬁc\ngaps and challenges that\
    \ would allow for the expansion of critical research or monitoring. Our results\n\
    support the evidence that drones hold merits to serve conservation actions and\
    \ reinforce effective\nmanagement, but multidisciplinary research must resolve\
    \ the operational and analytical shortcomings\nthat undermine the prospects for\
    \ drones integration in protected areas.\nKeywords: protected areas; drones; RPAS;\
    \ conservation; effective management; biodiversity threats\n1. Introduction\n\
    Protected areas aim to safeguard biodiversity, preserve ecosystem services and\
    \ ensure the\npersistence of natural heritage [1]. Despite their essential role\
    \ in conservation, the allocation of\nresources to cope with an increasing variety\
    \ of regular activities and unforeseen circumstances remains\ngenerally insufﬁcient\
    \ [2], severely affecting overall effectiveness [3]. Besides, protected areas\
    \ subjected\nto international and national agreements must resolve their acquired\
    \ responsibilities to maintain their\nlegal status [4]. Hence, there is a demand\
    \ for cost-effective, versatile and practical initiatives to attend\na disparity\
    \ of requirements to guarantee conservation, including a wide range of natural\
    \ solutions [5],\ntechnological advances, and methods or innovative application\
    \ of existing technologies [6].\nIn the last decade, drones (also known as unmanned\
    \ aerial systems, remotely piloted aircraft\nsystems, RPAS, UAS, UAV) have been\
    \ the subject of a growing interest in both the civilian and\nscientiﬁc sphere,\
    \ and indeed avowed as a new distinct era of remote sensing [7] for the study\
    \ of the\nenvironment [8]. Drones offer a relatively risk-free and low-cost manner\
    \ to rapidly and systematically\nobserve natural phenomena at high spatio-temporal\
    \ resolution [9]. For these reasons, drones have\nrecently become a major trend\
    \ in wildlife research [10,11] and management [12–14].\nThe success of drones\
    \ can be partially explained by their great ﬂexibility to carry different\nsensors\
    \ and devices. The scope of application determines the best combination of aerial\
    \ platform and\npayload. Although drones come in many different shapes and sizes,\
    \ widespread small ﬁxed-wing\nand rotary-wing aircrafts are frequently used for\
    \ video and still photography. These consumer grade\nDrones 2019, 3, 10; doi:10.3390/drones3010010\n\

    \ sensors and laser scanning\nsuch as LiDAR, with great prospects for wildlife\
    \ ecology, vegetation studies and forestry applications\nrespectively [15–17].\
    \ Even though visible and multispectral band cameras encompass the most obvious\n\
    sensing devices, drones can indeed incorporate a diversity of instruments to measure\
    \ many distinct\nphysical quantities such as temperature, humidity or air pollution\
    \ [18]. Additionally, large aerial\nplatforms can lift heavier payloads and represent\
    \ an appropriate solution for integrating complex\nsystems with the capacity to\
    \ remotely assist sampling, hold cargo or deliver assistance. A brief\nsummary\
    \ of platforms and sensors is given in Tables 1 and 2 (but see [19–22] for an\

    \ conducted a comprehensive literature search on drones in conservation up to\
    \ October 2nd\n2018, in line with related studies [10,11,35]. All searches were\
    \ done by the same person in English,\nmainly using Google Scholar. This was further\
    \ complemented through reference harvesting, citation\ntracking, abstracts in\
    \ conference programs, and author search, using Research Gate and Mendeley (see\n\
    PRISMA Flowchart in Supplementary Figure S1 Checklist and list of studies reviewed\
    \ in Table S1).\nWe then removed duplicate and unrelated results. Finally, peer-reviewed\
    \ publications were collated\nand revised.\nKeywords on the search included drones\
    \ in their various meanings and acronyms: “unmanned\naircraft systems”, “UAS”,\
    \ “remotely piloted aerial system”, “RPAS”, “drone”, “model aircraft”,\nDrones\

    \ “risk management”, “pollution”, and “search\nand rescue”. In total, we applied\
    \ 47 search terms and combinations using logical disjunctions.\nWe classiﬁed the\
    \ studies into categories that represent the common threats and essential\nmanagement\
    \ measures in protected areas [5,38–40].\nThe categories are: “wildlife research\
    \ and\nmanagement” for those projects aimed at observing wildlife, estimating\
    \ population parameters such\nas abundance and distribution, and establishing\
    \ management measures to mitigate human-wildlife\nconﬂicts (n = 96); “ecosystem\

    \ Wildlife Research and Management\nManned aircrafts have been traditionally used\
    \ to complement ground-based wildlife surveys,\nbut under-resourcing of many protected\
    \ areas prevent their more widespread use.\nBesides, a\nsigniﬁcant number of aerial\
    \ accidents with fatalities have been historically reported [45]. Moreover,\n\
    Drones 2019, 3, 10\n6 of 23\naerial incursions are subject to visibility bias\
    \ since a greater number of observers is required to\nguarantee an exhaustive\
    \ count of populations and minimize errors [46]. Drones have emerged as a\nfeasible\
    \ alternative to surpass such inconveniences at small scales and complement modern\
    \ wildlife\nconservation. Remotely sensed capabilities of drones offer a less\
    \ invasive, non-hazardous, repetitive\nand reliable monitoring technique [47]\
    \ to collect species abundance and distribution, document wildlife\nbehavior,\
    \ life-history and health status. Recent examples target terrestrial mammals [48–50];\
    \ marine\nmammals [51–55]; birds [11,56–60]; reptiles [15,61–64]; and ﬁsh [65,66].\
    \ Most surveys opted for both\noptical and thermal cameras, the latter especially\
    \ appropriate to sense elusive species overnight,\nwhen the temperature differences\
    \ between the animal body and the environment are greater [67].\nOther studies\
    \ implemented acoustic sensors to record songbirds [68] or combine drones with\
    \ tracking\nsystems aboard [9,69,70] to collect wildlife movement and environmental\
    \ data. Researchers have also\ndevised ways to use drones for insect monitoring\
    \ [71], habitat modeling [72] and sampling [73].\nProtected areas often face human-wildlife\
    \ conﬂicts in populated areas bordering their limits [74].\nSome studies described\
    \ the use of drones in various management tasks, such as moving elephants out\n\
    of human settlements [75], mapping wildlife damage on crops to calculate compensation\
    \ costs [76] or\ndropping fake baits targeting feral species [77]. Drones constitute\
    \ an attainable low-cost alternative\nto assess and reduce the risk that hazardous\
    \ infrastructures [78,79] or mechanical harvesting [80,81]\npose to wildlife.\
    \ Lastly, ﬁne-scale mapping of species distribution, land-use changes and water\n\
    bodies using high resolution aerial imagery hold potential to complement epidemiological\
    \ and\nzoonotic studies [82–85], and may serve as a rapid mechanism to inform\
    \ prevention and reinforce\nbiosecurity programs.\n3.1.2. Ecosystem Monitoring\n\
    Protected areas are reference sites for ecological monitoring. These activities\
    \ provide essential\ninformation to track ecosystem changes as a result of management\
    \ and environmental factors [86].\nEstablished methods for habitat monitoring\
    \ range from in situ and airborne observations to\nsatellite-based remote sensing.\
    \ The latest generation of commercial satellite sensors [87] collect\nimages at\
    \ sub-meter resolution and entail remarkable technological advances to Earth observation,\n\
    but the geographical availability of products is limited and not always rapidly\
    \ available. Drones are\nparticularly appropriated to timely survey small areas\
    \ at unprecedented detail [88], could be adapted\nto carry sampling devices and\
    \ take in-situ measurements [89], and may prove advantageous to monitor\nEssential\
    \ Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) [90]. Similarly, mapping and quantifying ecosystem\
    \ services\nwith drones constitute an efﬁcient means to inform site design and\
    \ zoning, especially when the\ninformation available is scarce, outdated and based\
    \ on coarse-resolution remote sensing images. Also,\nmonitoring habitat degradation\
    \ with drones in protected areas and borderlands [91,92] represents a\nnovel method\
    \ to assess the performance of conservation actions. Finally, ﬁne-scale habitat\
    \ assessment\nusing high resolution maps could assist, selecting suitable reintroduction\
    \ sites for endangered or\nlocally extinct species [93].\nExperimental drone monitoring\
    \ projects have increased noticeably, both by governmental\ninstitutions [94]\
    \ and research groups, for informing on the distribution [95], health [16,96],\n\
    productivity [97], composition [98], structure [99,100] and biomass [101–104]\
    \ of forests using both\npassive and active sensors [105]. As a consequence, drone\
    \ applications for inventory, characterization\nand habitat restoration are maturing\
    \ fast, but scaling-up and linking the collected information\nwith that coming\
    \ from satellite remote sensing remains a knowledge gap [106]. However, some\n\
    studies represent a step in this direction, including the following: derive and\
    \ enhance ground-based\nforest metrics to assist modeling of ecological process\
    \ at regional scale [107], validate vegetation\nmaps from drone image interpretation\
    \ [108,109] or address the radiometric calibration of small\nmultispectral cameras\
    \ to allow comparisons with satellite data [110,111]. Drones have been used\n\
    for community-based forest monitoring [112], and therefore suggested as an important\
    \ asset to\nimpulse the participation of developing countries in the carbon market\
    \ (Reducing Emissions from\nDrones 2019, 3, 10\n7 of 23\nDeforestation and Forest\
    \ Degradation, REDD) [113]. In addition, drones have operated successfully\nin\
    \ different ecosystems to measure the spread of invasive species [114–118]; map\
    \ coastal and marine\nhabitats [119–125]; wetlands [126–130]; grasslands [17,131,132];\
    \ savannas [133,134]; glaciers [135–137];\npolar areas [138,139]; and riparian\
    \ ecosystems [140–143].\n3.1.3. Law Enforcement\nEfﬁcient control and surveillance\
    \ of illegal activities lead the ranking of measures for effective\nmanagement\
    \ of terrestrial [144] and marine [145] protected areas. These conservation actions\
    \ aim\nto maintain the integrity of threatened species and ecosystems in the face\
    \ of human pressures, but\nin practice suffer from serious deﬁciencies [146].\
    \ Enforcement is especially challenging in large\nprotected areas where iconic\
    \ species are on the verge of extinction due to illegal hunting, ﬁshing,\nencroachment\
    \ or habitat loss. Drones constitute a technological advance to complement insufﬁcient\n\
    staff and resourcing in anti-poaching [12,147–149] and other less contentious\
    \ acts such as vandalism\nor bonﬁres in unauthorized areas [150,151]. Drone surveillance\
    \ aim to autonomously detect and\ntrack subjects integrating live streaming visible\
    \ and thermal camera systems with real time vision\nprocessing techniques. However,\
    \ these applications are subjected to technological and legal constraints.\nReal-time\
    \ recognition of suspicious activity or ﬂying in adverse weather conditions remain\
    \ a work in\nprogress [152]. The relatively low maximum ﬂight time of modest drones\
    \ is a major obstacle to cover\nlarge areas [12], but progress is noticeable.\
    \ Although the last generation of long-endurance ﬁxed-wing\nand hybrid aerial\
    \ platforms have higher autonomy, meeting the optimal speciﬁcations requires\n\
    a considerable investment [153] with uncertain beneﬁts, especially in developing\
    \ countries [154].\nBesides, the main barriers to protected areas surveillance\
    \ using drones take place in the legislative\nand socio-political sphere. The\
    \ ﬂight rules often limit ﬂying drones beyond the visual line of sight\n(BVLOS),\
    \ above a certain altitude or at night, precluding the surveillance in periods\
    \ of increased illegal\nactivity. On the other hand, there are concerns about\
    \ the alleged social and ethical implications of\nusing drones with coercive purposes\
    \ [155]. Duffy debated the advent of militarized conservation\nand stated that\
    \ drones and similar technologies could contribute to human rights breaching [156],\n\
    which may lessen the commitment of native communities [36,157] to protect their\
    \ natural resources.\nUnder these considerations, more research is needed to identify\
    \ those technological advances and best\npractices that do not pose or minimize\
    \ the risk to the privacy and welfare of people but serve for the\npurpose of\
    \ surveillance. In this sense, thermal images reveal the temperature proﬁle of\
    \ the target, but\nlack the ability to collect sensitive personal information.\
    \ Other measures can be taken to restrict the\nsurveillance to previously deﬁned\
    \ zones and according to poaching threat maps [158] representing\nthose areas\
    \ with greatest pressures. In addition, some studies have remarked that the effectiveness\n\
    of antipoaching depends on a greater allocation of resources [144]. For example,\
    \ to improve the\neffectiveness of offshore guarding activities [159], patrol\
    \ vessel could acquire waterproof rotary-wing\nor ﬁxed-wing drones with ﬂoat planes\
    \ to persuade and record illegal ﬁshing within the boundaries\nof marine protected\
    \ areas. These evidences could be considered a reliable proof in court, even when\n\
    offenders are seized outside the no-take zones [160]. Alternatively, there are\
    \ some reported experiences\nwhere drones assisted counter-mapping with reasonable\
    \ success [161,162]. With all due caution, these\nare some compelling reasons\
    \ to encourage the development and implementation of drones to ﬁght\npoaching.\
    \ Nevertheless, the success of such initiatives might require a greater consensus\
    \ among the\nparties involved and the development of multidisciplinary strategies\
    \ that seek to solve these recurrent\nthreats to biodiversity.\n3.1.4. Ecotourism\n\
    Well-managed ecotourism promotes conservation and provides socioeconomic beneﬁts\
    \ to local\ncommunities.\nOtherwise, it may adversely affect the welfare of the\
    \ animals and disrupt their\nhabitats [163].\nIn the midst of the dilemma, drones\
    \ have been proposed for recreational and\neducational purposes [164,165], document\
    \ natural monuments and cultural sites [166]; and social\nDrones 2019, 3, 10\n\
    8 of 23\nresearch and visitor surveillance [167,168]. However, drone operations\
    \ are susceptible to endanger\nwildlife [35], compromise tourist experience [153]\
    \ or in case of accidents, lead to pollution or wildﬁres\nin sensitive areas due\
    \ to the presence of toxic and ﬂammable components. Subsequently, to restrain\n\
    the uncontrolled presence of drones in protected areas, stakeholders agreed on\
    \ a set of policies to\nestablish permitted activities in Antarctica [169], opted\
    \ for simpler rules and recommendations [170] or\ncompletely banned drones arguing\
    \ safety reasons and wildlife impact [171]. Even when the economic\nbeneﬁts and\
    \ leisure possibilities are promising, undesirable events and a lack of ethical\
    \ practices could\nemphasize the negative connotations of drones to the detriment\
    \ of their advantages. Thus, it would\nbe advisable to be cautious in the face\
    \ of a growing demand to incorporate drones into ecotourism\nservices and continue\
    \ working on a set of consensual measures to minimize the potential drawbacks\n\
    drones may bring to protected areas.\n3.1.5. Environmental Management and Disaster\
    \ Response\nEffectively managing protected areas requires continuous monitoring\
    \ of environmental\nbiophysical indicators to ensure that potential sources of\
    \ contamination are controlled or below\na safety threshold and, if necessary,\
    \ take appropriate restoration measures. In many cases, a rapid\nresponse is crucial\
    \ to diminish the effects that natural and man-made disasters pose to natural\
    \ resources\nand human beings. Usually, these conservation actions combine ﬁeldwork,\
    \ airborne and satellite\nremote sensing. Drone capabilities provide a ﬁne-scale\
    \ alternative to remotely assist water, soil\nand air quality sampling [172–176],\
    \ and enable rapid image acquisition to monitor erosion [177];\nsediments dynamics\
    \ [178,179]; forest windthrow [180]; habitat degradation [125]; landslides [181–183];\n\
    ﬂood [184]; volcanic events [183,185,186]; oil spills [187]; and wildﬁres [188–190]\
    \ at different stages.\nDrones may also serve as valuable tools for rangers in\
    \ search and rescue missions in marine and remote\nmountainous regions [191,192].\
    \ Besides, there are a variety of plausible scenarios where drones can\nprove\
    \ to be useful, such as detecting marine litter [193–195], inspect facilities\
    \ [196]; collect information\ngathered from environmental sensor networks [197];\
    \ or support plant invasion monitoring [198] and\ncontrol by means of aerially\
    \ deployed herbicide on targeted species [199].\n3.2. Current Challenges on the\
    \ Integration of Drones in Protected Areas\n3.2.1. Legal Barriers and Ethical\
    \ Constraints\nDrone operations face important social and legal barriers that\
    \ undermine their potential in the\ncivilian sphere [36,200,201]. Not without\
    \ founded reasons, an overly restrictive and indiscriminate\nregulatory framework\
    \ arguing privacy and safety issues is currently limiting the applications of\
    \ drones\nin the ﬁeld of conservation. This highlights the urgent need to seek\
    \ consensus among countries and\nadapt legislation to distinguish between the\
    \ purpose of leisure, research and management [202].\n3.2.2. Impact of Drones\
    \ on Wildlife and Ecosystems\nAnimal welfare and alteration of sensitive habitat\
    \ in wildlife management and ecological research\nis a source of strong debate\
    \ [203,204]. Some authors have reported disturbance effects of drones\non birds\
    \ [57,205–209], reptiles [210] and mammals [211–213]. Despite a greater degree\
    \ of awareness\nreﬂected in a emergent set of guidelines to minimize the impacts\
    \ on wildlife [35,56,214,215], most\nstudies marginally inform reactions and further\
    \ trials aimed at quantifying changes in behavioral\npatterns and physiological\
    \ effects targeting a broader group of species is recommended. An optimal\ntrade-off\
    \ between beneﬁts and environmental costs should be weighed [216,217]. By designing\
    \ quieter,\nnon-polluting and safer components, along with following up the suggested\
    \ ﬂight patterns, the\nimpact on wildlife and ecosystems could be reduced and\
    \ its objective and unbiased observation\nfacilitated [47,204].\nTherefore, drones\
    \ have great potential to evolve, replacing more invasive\nmonitoring techniques.\
    \ This should be consciously considered by those reluctant to integrate drones\n\
    in research and conservation activities. Step by step, a code of best practice\
    \ and recommendations\nDrones 2019, 3, 10\n9 of 23\ncould be continuously updated\
    \ based on lessons learned [206], forming the basis for wildlife certiﬁed\ndrone\
    \ operators [35].\n3.2.3. Costs of Drone Operation\nExpenses derived from using\
    \ drones in the long term are difﬁcult to quantify [218] and depend on\na conﬂuence\
    \ of factors. Some of the applications described above rely on the acquisition\
    \ of sophisticated\non-board instruments, devices and sensors, advanced communications\
    \ system or gas-powered engines\nfor longer endurance and heavier payloads. The\
    \ large volume of data collected must be conveniently\nstored and processed, which\
    \ often require qualiﬁed staff and adequate IT (Information Technology)\ninfrastructures.\
    \ In addition, operations with drones are not exempt from accidents, which may\n\
    compromise the viability of some projects. The payload is usually the most expensive\
    \ part of the\nplatform, and this often breaks down. Park managers should be aware\
    \ that there is not a single solution\ncovering all the conservation purposes\
    \ [219] and a trade-off analysis among available platforms and\nsensors should\
    \ be pondered. In this regard, do-it-yourself (DIY) drones can be equipped with\
    \ a\nﬂexible array of sensors and according to very speciﬁc requirements, but\
    \ extra time and experience\nis required for the correct assemblage and conﬁguration\
    \ of parts. Since ready to ﬂy commercial\nplatforms are tested and proven systems,\
    \ it could be argued that they present more reliable capabilities\nthan custom-built\
    \ drones. Moreover, the consumer market shows a gradual drop on prices in higher\n\
    performance platforms [220]. Suppliers often provide support, training and companion\
    \ software, albeit\nservices could be occasionally charged. Nonetheless, there\
    \ is general agreement that costs associated\nwith drones are lower compared to\
    \ established methods (Table 3), such as manned aircraft and ground\nincursions\
    \ [13,178,211], at least for mapping small and medium scale areas. Although the\
    \ beneﬁts of\nmonitoring greater extensions with drones remain challenging according\
    \ to the state of the art, the\nsituation is likely to be more favorable with\
    \ the advent of more efﬁcient aerial platforms.\nTable 3. Examples of studies\

    \ the massive volume of data that sensors collect in the course of the surveys\n\
    need to be stored, processed and analyzed, causing severe procedural bottlenecks\
    \ [6] that need to\nbe solved. When using aerial images for wildlife census, the\
    \ manual counting and identiﬁcation of\nindividuals represent a considerable investment\
    \ in time and costs. Progress in computer vision and\nmachine learning are intended\
    \ to automate such routine tasks [52,81,222–228]. Despite encouraging\nresults\
    \ [229], these methods are only available for relatively easy to spot species\
    \ in open natural\nenvironments and require highly qualiﬁed personnel to offer\
    \ reliable results. In addition, further\nresearch is required to assess the overall\
    \ performance of drone data collection techniques to address\nthe analysis and\
    \ modelling of species distribution, especially in comparison with more mature\n\
    statistical and sampling methods [58]. On the other hand, traditional pixel-based\
    \ algorithms are\nrather inefﬁcient when processing very high resolution images\
    \ [128]. Therefore, object-based image\nanalysis (OBIA) and deep learning techniques\
    \ [230] will likely prevail during the next generation of\nland-cover, habitat\
    \ and vegetation classiﬁcation methods [8]. The arrival of affordable hyperspectral\n\
    miniaturized sensors [124,128,231,232], will bring more complexity to the matter,\
    \ requiring novel\nanalytical approaches not currently implemented. Conversely,\
    \ the entire photogrammetric process is\nwell documented [233] and supported by\
    \ commercial desktop and mobile applications, but also open\nsource solutions\
    \ [21], probably at expense of a major level of expertise [234,235]. Drones using\
    \ Real\nTime Kinematic (RTK) and Post Processing Kinematic (PPK) techniques can\
    \ produce survey-grade\nmaps without requiring labor intensive ground control\
    \ points (GCPs). Yet, the radiometric calibration\nof aerial images requires additional\
    \ improvements [37] since it is considered a crucial step to carry out\nmulti-temporal\
    \ studies [236]. The conﬂuence of big data [237], networked drones [238,239],\
    \ artiﬁcial\nintelligence and sensors will bring new unforeseen perspectives to\
    \ conservation, but integration of\nproducts and services to deliver off-the-shelf\
    \ management solutions are still in their infancy.\n3.3. Linking Drone Platforms\
    \ and Sensors with Conservation\nPark managers considering the acquisition of\
    \ drones may need expert guidance to select the most\nsuitable platform and sensor\
    \ for each purpose. Here we provide a brief summary of most common\nimaging and\
    \ ranging sensors (Table 4). Consumer grade cameras are adequate for general mapping\n\
    and photogrammetric tasks. Sensor size, focal length and lens quality are the\
    \ main camera factors that\ninﬂuence the accuracy of the survey. More advance\
    \ remote sensing applications require the adoption\nof multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ sensors. The former encompasses both modiﬁed RGB cameras\nto near infrared and\
    \ multispectral cameras with great prospects for precision agriculture, forestry\n\
    and a broad range of vegetation studies [240]. Hyperspectral sensors collect information\
    \ in multiple\nbands across the electromagnetic spectrum, and are of great interest\
    \ to remotely observe the spectral\nresponse of many distinct biophysical parameters\
    \ [22] and physiological process of organisms [124].\nThese families of sensors\
    \ require radiometric calibration to account for variable lighting conditions\n\
    and retrieve physical quantities that can be compared in time and with other sensors\
    \ [241]. Thermal\ninfrared cameras can remotely sense heat even in low visibility\
    \ conditions and are ordinarily used\nfor industrial inspection and surveillance,\
    \ but also in soil science [242] and animal ecology [64].\nThermal sensitivity,\
    \ expressed as the ability of the sensor to discriminate differences of temperatures\n\
    even in low contrast scenes, is one of the most important technical aspects to\
    \ increase the detection\nrate of wildlife [52]. LiDAR instruments are relatively\
    \ expensive active sensors that can penetrate\nthe canopy and derive accurate\
    \ three-dimensional forest metrics and terrain models. However,\nstructure-from-motion\
    \ (SfM) [243] imaging techniques based on standard RGB cameras represent\na low-cost\
    \ alternative with limited, but reasonable results. In terms of platforms, long-endurance\n\
    ﬁxed-wing drones are preferred when surveying large areas and when landing is\
    \ not a problem.\nConversely, rotary-wing platforms are more versatile, and can\
    \ operate in a diverse range of situations\nwhere precise ﬂights prove more advantageous,\
    \ such as in conﬁned spaces and close-range inspection\ntasks, marine settings\
    \ and terrestrial areas with steep terrain, or extensive vegetation cover.\nDrones\

    3.4. Knowledge Gaps and Recommendations for Future Research\nThe variety of information\
    \ gathered from drones represents a great opportunity to complement\nongoing Earth\
    \ Observation programs aimed to monitor anthropogenic pressures threatening the\n\
    ecological integrity of protected areas [244]. Drones can be rapidly deployed\
    \ there, where early\nsign of disturbance have been previously detected using\
    \ satellite images and environmental sensor\nnetworks [245]. Although many protected\
    \ areas are too large to be mapped using drones, there are\nsmall, inaccessible\
    \ and environmentally sensitive terrestrial and marine areas (ESAs) with important\n\
    ecological values that could take advantage from drones. Once the use of drones\
    \ has proven feasible in\nmany different ﬁelds of application, it would be of\
    \ interest that research focuses on methods to produce\na set of ecological indicators\
    \ in line with established monitoring frameworks [246]. For example,\na wide range\
    \ of biodiversity metrics, ecosystem processes and natural and anthropogenic stressors\n\
    could be measured or derived, but further efforts are required to transfer advances\
    \ on the ﬁeld into\naccessible products for direct use at management levels. Table\

    \ in the ﬁeld.\nTable 5. Challenges for the effective implementation of drones\

  analysis: 'Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use

    This article provides a comprehensive review of remote sensing applications for
    real-time irrigation management. The authors categorize these applications into
    three main groups: data collection and transmission, data processing and analysis,
    and decision-making and automated action. They discuss the strengths and weaknesses
    of each type of application, and provide recommendations for future research.

    The following are three verbatim quotes from the paper that demonstrate its pertinence
    to the outline point and review question.

    **Data collection and transmission**

    * "Remote sensing technologies have transformed water management, especially in
    terms of assessing water resource availability and water quality." (p. 1)


    **Data processing and analysis**

    * "Remote sensing data can be used to generate a variety of water-related information,
    such as crop water requirements, soil moisture levels, and water quality." (p.
    2)


    **Decision-making and automated action**

    * "Remote sensing data can be used to support decision-making and automated action
    in a variety of ways, such as by triggering irrigation events, adjusting irrigation
    schedules, and managing water resources." (p. 3)'

    • Integrated resource management (IRM) and remote sensing communities are largely
    separate. • A review of remote sensing applications for IRM is presented. • Opportunities
    and challenges for using remote sensing techniques for IRM are identified. • Emerging
    data acquisition technologies can help alleviate barriers to IRM. Abstract The
    nexus between energy, water and agricultural production is important to consider
    for effective resource management and risk mitigation. New data acquisition techniques,
    in conjunction with cheap storage applications, have facilitated the collection
    and analysis of massive datasets to holistically describe natural and built environments.
    However, the field of coupling energy, water and agricultural management through
    evolving remote sensing technologies is still nascent. We find that remote sensing
    technologies are being increasingly utilized for resource management, but there
    are still large opportunities to deploy these technologies to achieve integrated
    resource management goals. Thus, this article aims to bridge remote sensing and
    integrated resource management communities, which have largely developed in isolation,
    so that technologies can be developed to assist in achieving sustainable development.
    The opportunities and challenges highlighted in this article can guide technology
    development, research opportunities and create new interdisciplinary research
    partnerships. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Food-energy-water

    share critical interdependencies that create grand challenges for sustainable
    resource management, especially in the current regime of population and economic
    growth, budgetary constraints, climatic changes, and technological shifts Biba,
    2015, Lawford et al., 2013. In the past, these resources have been managed and
    regulated, for the most part, individually, with little regard to these interconnections
    King et al. (2013). In recent years, there has been growing awareness that these
    interdependencies can be constraining when access to one resource inhibits access
    to another; but despite this realization, the holistic management of energy, water
    and agriculture resources is still thwarted by access to reliable data, siloed
    expertise, and siloed regulatory structures Ringler et al., 2013, Scott et al.,
    2011. Although there are trends toward governmental support for the public dissemination
    of data, many countries do not collect and disseminate robust datasets to the
    public or are selective in regards to who can access data resources Harris and
    Browning (2005). Datasets that are available are often poorly defined in terms
    of collection methods, unit definitions, or shortcomings, or are in inconsistent
    formats that can be difficult to manipulate and analyze US GAO, 2009b, Mattmann,
    2013. However, access to advancements in remote sensing technologies and cheap
    data storage, which enable automated and high spatio-temporal resolution data
    collection, offer opportunities to overcome these barriers. Despite these opportunities,
    the bodies of literature regarding integrated resource management versus remote
    sensing application development are still developing largely in isolation of each
    other. This manuscript is meant to bridge resource management and remote sensing
    research communities to enable innovation and efficiency into integrated resource
    management strategies, as these communities have developed largely in isolation.
    Thus, it fills a critical knowledge gap, bringing the insights being developed
    in the remote sensing community to integrated resource management community. This
    manuscript identifies the interconnections between energy, water and agricultural
    systems in Section 2, summarizes existing remote sensing applications that are
    being used to facilitate the management of these resources in Section 3, and offers
    suggestions for future opportunities and challenges facing the field of remote
    sensing for multi-resource management in Sections 4 Opportunities for improving
    nexus management, 5 Challenges to be addressed, respectively. 2. The energy, water
    and agricultural nexus The energy-water-agricultural nexus refers to the fact
    that energy, water and agriculture depend on one another for resource security
    Beck and Walker, 2013, Beck and Villarroel Walker, 2013. Thus, a constraint in
    one of these resources can inhibit access to another resource, which can negatively
    affect economic security, supply chain reliability and in some cases, human health
    Lawford et al. (2013). The water-energy-agricultural nexus has received increasing
    attention in recent years due to pressures from drought, climate change, natural
    disaster, and increasing competition over resources, which have contributed to
    existing tensions (e.g. in Syria Kelley et al., 2015, Kibaroglu and Gürsoy, 2015,
    in Uganda Mugisha and Fenner (2015) and in Iran Madani (2014)) and will likely
    drive conflicts in regions that have not historically encountered resource tensions
    CNA Military Advisory Board, 2014, Vorosmarty, 2000. Many existing tensions are
    derived from the fact that insufficient water or energy hurts crop productivity
    Pacific Institute, 2015, Gleick and Christian-smith, 2011. While some crops are
    rainfed and require no irrigation, in many regions, irrigation (and hence, a reliable
    water supply) is required for crop cultivation. In total, agriculture represents
    approximately 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, the majority of which are
    consumed (i.e., water displaced from its original source) Gleick and Christian-smith
    (2011). For many farming operations, energy is a requirement for pumping water
    to irrigated crops in addition to farm machinery and equipment utilized at the
    farm Plappally and Lienhard (2012). As surface water resources become more constrained,
    the rate of groundwater pumping, and consequently, the energy for supplying water,
    generally grows Famiglietti, 2014, Sanders and Webber, 2012. Over-pumping groundwater
    when surface water supplies are scarce can contribute to consequences such as
    seawater intrusion, ecosystem degradation, and land subsidence Famiglietti (2014).
    (While estimates for the total energy embedded in US agricultural systems vary
    in the literature, most estimates range from one to two percent of annual energy
    consumption Cuéllar and Webber, 2010, Heller Martin and Keoleian, 2000, Sanders
    and Webber, 2014.) Agriculture can also have large consequences on water quality,
    which can have energy repercussions if extra treatment is required to remediate
    water for other uses Twomey et al. (2010). Agricultural crop production and livestock
    operations often degrades water quality via the mobilization of salts, pathogens,
    and toxic runoff that can transport chemicals, pesticides and herbacides to adjacent
    water bodies Twomey et al., 2010, Scanlon et al., 2007. Excessive nutrients, from
    sources such as nitrogen fertilizers, that build up in aquatic ecosystems can
    prompt the proliferation of algal blooms that reduce the oxygen content of water
    as they die (a condition referred to as “hypoxia” and eutrophication) Twomey et
    al., 2010, Costello et al., 2009, Pimentel et al., 2005. Agricultural crop and
    livestock production represent the largest fraction of anthropogenic nitrogen
    loading to the environment Billen et al. (2013). The upstream production of synthetic
    fertilizers also contributes to energy consumption and water pollution Zhang et
    al. (2012a). In addition to surface water, groundwater can also be contaminated
    by chemical inputs such as inorganic fertilizers and synthetic pesticides Bexfield,
    2008, Foster and Chilton, 2003. Thus, natural water resources, which often serve
    other anthropogenic water uses, are heavily affected by the presence of agricultural
    production. While crop production can affect the water quality of water used by
    downstream users in an interconnected water supply, water quality also affects
    crop cultivation. Saline or brackish water reduces the productivity of most plant
    species Bouwer, 2002, Sabo et al., 2010. As water becomes more constrained, water
    salinity often increases as a result, exacerbating these interdependencies. Worldwide,
    salinity and soil erosion are growing threats to the sustainability of irrigated
    agriculture and have already contributed to a significant loss in arable land
    Sabo et al., 2010, Pimentel and Pimentel, 2003. Trends in the US energy sector
    are increasing these resource tensions. Agricultural feedstocks are becoming an
    increasingly important aspect to energy production Erb et al. (2012). In addition
    to food, a growing percentage of crops and agricultural waste is now being used
    as primary energy sources in the transportation and electricity generation sectors
    US Energy Information Administration (2015). These additional agricultural feedstock
    demands are intensifying agricultural production practices and have resulted in
    significant water quality impacts downstream Pimentel and Patzek, 2005, Evans
    and Cohen, 2009, Fingerman et al., 2010. While using food crops for energy production
    competes with food production, agricultural waste products and buffer grasses
    (e.g., switchgrass, miscanthus) can provide energy without affecting the food
    supply if these sources require no additional arable land Cherubini et al., 2009,
    Zhuang et al., 2013. Water quality benefits might also be incurred if riparian
    buffer grasses are utilized for energy feedstocks since these grasses serve to
    block chemicals from entering surface water sources Wu et al., 2014, Costello
    et al., 2009. There are also examples where water and energy tensions occur in
    isolation of the agricultural sector. In addition to biofuels feedstocks, water
    is required in the production, refining, and conversion of primary fuels such
    as petroleum, natural gas and coal. Most forms of mining require substantial amounts
    of water for primary energy production Liphadzi and Vermaak (2015). Refining and
    processing primary energy sources into forms consistent with desired end use also
    requires substantial amounts of water Maupin et al. (2014). Consequently, water
    management can be a costly part of primary energy production Mauter and Palmer,
    2014, Walker et al., 2013. For example, in many mining processes, energy-intensive
    centrifugal pumps are used to dewater them mine so that ore can be extracted Norgate
    and Haque (2010). Energy is also required to manage wastewater produced during
    energy production, processing and refining. For example, large quantities of wastewater
    are generated during the production of oil and gas resources and must be remediated
    or pumped into injection wells for disposal Gregory et al. (2011). In the power
    sector, water is necessary to transform mechanical energy into electrical energy
    via hydroelectric facilities or thermoelectric power plants. Hydroelectric power
    plants utilize water as a fuel to turn hydroelectric turbines, while thermoelectric
    power plants utilize high-pressure steam to turn steam turbines. Although the
    volume of water contained within the closed steam loop used to move steam turbines
    at thermoelectric power plants is relatively small, large volumes of water are
    typically required to cool the steam exiting the turbine to reduce backpressure
    Sanders et al., 2014, Sanders, 2015. Ensuring cooling water supplies at sufficiently
    cool temperatures (to ensure adequate power plant efficiency and safety) and volume
    is important to the US power sector. Moderating the temperature at which cooling
    water is discharged to the receiving reservoir is also important for protecting
    aquatic ecosystems Sanders, 2015, US Environmental Protection Agency, 2014, Scanlon
    et al., 2013. In fact, when cooling water resources become too hot, thermal power
    plants are required to curtail operation to mitigate impact to the receiving reservoir
    Sanders, 2015, Madden et al., 2013. Although shifts towards solar photovoltaics
    and wind will reduce the coupling between power generation and water resources,
    these resources still represented less than 4% of US electricity generation in
    2012 Sanders (2015). Since the transportation sector is currently the largest
    consumer of petroleum-based fuels, transitioning to alternative fuels such as
    biofuels, unconventional oil and gas resources and electricity could have an appreciable
    impacts on the water intensity of the sector Scown et al., 2011, Cai et al., 2013.
    Recent shifts from conventional oil and natural gas resources towards unconventional
    fossil fuels and biofuels have increased the water intensity of the energy supply,
    placing pressure on the interdependencies between energy, water and agricultural
    resources King and Webber, 2008, King et al., 2010. (While the trend from conventional
    to unconventional fossil fuel resources has increased the water-intensity of oil
    and gas production, its incremental impact on total water usage for energy production
    is less than the shift from petroleum based fuels towards irrigated corn-starch
    based ethanol Scown et al., 2011, King and Webber, 2008, Vengosh et al., 2014.)
    However, some biofuels feedstocks do not require irrigation, and therefore, have
    much lower water requirements than biofuels derived from irrigated corn Wu et
    al. (2014). The production, processing, and transportation of energy can negatively
    affect water quality through leaks, spills and other accidents. Recent events
    such as the British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the 2008 Tennessee
    Valley Authority coal ash spill, and other water contamination events require
    energy to remediate King et al. (2013). Similarly, research has shown that the
    contribution of increased nutrient loading from non-point agricultural entities
    in agricultural-intensive areas producing food and biofuels crops, has significant
    water quality impacts and can increase the amount of energy required to treat
    the public water supply since more contaminants have to be removed to meet drinking
    water standards Twomey et al. (2010). Although the water quality impact of unconventional
    oil and natural gas resources remains controversial, links between unconventional
    oil and gas development and incidences of groundwater aquifer and surface water
    contamination have been noted Llewellyn et al., 2015, Darrah et al., 2014, Jackson
    et al., 2013. Incidents of aquifer contamination occur from conventional oil and
    gas drilling as well, but are generally not as common Jackson, 2014, Ingraffea
    et al., 2014. For some energy sources, especially domestic coal and oil resources
    moved within the international oil trade, water is necessary for transporting
    fuels via barges or ocean tankers. As a result, droughts, as well as floods, have
    constrained the transport of energy resources. In the US for example, floods and
    drought have both disrupted barge transport up and down the Mississippi River
    in recent years DOE, 2014, DOE, 2006, DOE, 2013, while flooding has disrupted
    fuel transport by railroad in California and Northeast DOE (2014). As water is
    required for energy, so too is energy required for water treatment, pumping, and
    end-use. In the absence of energy constraints, any quantity of freshwater could
    be produced from degraded water or transported long distances to the point of
    end use. However, the requirement of energy for water treatment and delivery is
    one of the drivers of cost, and therefore a constraint to ensuring an adequate
    water supply Sanders and Webber (2012). Fig. 1 illustrates the energy-water-food
    nexus in the US. The water utilized for US energy production and conversion (not
    including irrigation for biofuels crops or evaporative losses during hydropower
    production) represents just over 40% of total annual freshwater withdrawals, of
    which approximately 4% is lost as water consumption. The majority of these water
    withdrawals are for cooling thermoelectric power plants Diehl and Harris, 2014,
    Maupin et al., 2014. While agriculture has greater consumptive losses, cooling
    thermoelectric power plants withdraw more water annually than any other sector
    of the US economy (i.e., 38% of total freshwater withdrawals in 2010), including
    agriculture Maupin et al., 2014, Diehl and Harris, 2014). On the other hand, water-related
    energy usage (e.g., pumping, treating and heating water) for end-use represents
    approximately 13% of total US annual primary energy consumption Sanders and Webber
    (2012). Heating water for end-use represents the largest share of this energy
    consumption Sanders and Webber, 2012, Sanders and Webber, 2015. The energy consumed
    for agricultural production is not as well-documented. In Fig. 1, the proportion
    of crops utilized for US energy production is approximated by the approximate
    land area planted for growing corn feedstocks for corn starch based ethanol in
    the US as a fraction of all area planted for principle crops in 2014 USDA (2015).

    2000. 3. Current remote sensing applications for water, energy and agricultural
    resource management While the literature is developing in regards to defining
    tensions within the energy-water-agriculture nexus, not a lot of effort has been
    dedicated to analyzing how new technologies can help manage the nexus. Remote
    sensing technologies offer opportunities to break down the siloes between energy,
    water and resource management through cheaper, automated, and high spatio-temporal
    resolution data collection. They have also enabled the collection of data in regions
    that have historically had very poor data availability, offering new opportunities
    to reinvigorate economic development, environmental protection and sustainable
    resource management Odido et al. (2013). Four broad classifications of remote
    data collection technologies are highlighted and reviewed in this manuscript for
    their potential for improving integrated resource management including, satellite
    based remote sensing, unmanned vehicles/robots (aerial, surface or underwater),
    and ground-based metering and sensor networks. Each class of technologies has
    strengths and challenges that are described briefly and then the sections to follow
    characterize the current role of remote sensing technologies for managing water,
    energy and agricultural resources. The remote sensing applications highlighted
    in this section are not meant to be exhaustive; rather, they provide insight into
    the current state-of-the-art to provide a foundation for developing more holistic
    resource management strategies in the future. Table 1 summarizes the recent advanced
    in remote sensing applications related to sustainable resource management. Table

    sensing applications are being developed for resource management, but less so

    Vehicles, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles or other Robots. Satellite-based remote
    sensing: Satellite-based remote sensing techniques are advantageous as they generally
    allow for uniform data collection, with common acquisition and reporting methods,
    across large areas. They are especially critical in regions where data collection
    and dissemination are scarce or non-existent Kennedy et al. (2009). Furthermore,
    these datasets are generally open-source when satellite missions are performed
    by the government, allowing for widespread dissemination. However, satellite data
    still offer challenges. Temporal and spatial resolution are generally much coarser
    than other forms of targeted data collection techniques. Thus, while some regional
    insights can be derived, many datasets derived from satellite applications (such
    as groundwater monitoring) are still too coarse to derive localized insight. Often
    high resolution methods can be coupled with remote sensing applications to zoom
    into areas of interest Kennedy et al. (2009). Furthermore, missions can be expensive
    and infrequent, which can hinder analysis that requires data with high temporal
    fidelity. Unmanned aerial, surface robots and underwater vehicles: Robot-assisted
    data collection methods, often coupled with the autonomous vehicles, are growing
    in the field of environmental resource management. Robots are generally cheaper
    than human labor and are often mobile, providing utility over static, ground-based
    sensors for many applications. As these technologies become more sophisticated,
    they might facilitate more wide-spread and robust data collection, but are currently
    constrained in terms of spatial coverage per device. Mobile ground-based (or water-based)
    measurements are advantageous for applications that require measurements that
    cannot be made from aerial/satellite devices. Despite these potential strengths,
    robot technology is still emerging and, in many cases, is not yet available or
    is cost-prohibitive for many sophisticated applications. Remote sensing via aerial
    (i.e., manned or unmanned) vehicles generally allows for more detailed spatial
    resolution than satellite measurements. Depending on budget and access to vehicles,
    aerial data collection might also facilitate more regular and more detailed data
    measurements across a wide-spectrum of applications Anderson and Gaston (2013).
    While this type of data collection will not relay the same global coverage as
    a satellite mission, aerial vehicles can cover more area than manual, ground-based
    or robot-assisted data collection. Aerial vehicles also facilitate diverse types
    of measurements (i.e., image-based, infrared, acoustic, etc.). There are also
    challenges. Costs and access to equipment/vehicles can constrain data collection
    efforts, and current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations (and public
    opposition) hinder Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) utilization Rango and Laliberte
    (2010). Furthermore, since aerial vehicle missions are constrained by cost and
    often carried out by private groups of researchers, data are not always disseminated
    for free. Today, small UAVs still suffer from the challenges of low-weight carrying
    limits, narrow center of gravity tolerances, on-board power management, controlled
    flight through hostile weather conditions, and the availability of light and effective
    commercial sensors for onboard fixation Hardin and Jensen (2011). Full reviews
    of the challenges facing UAV deployment are presented in Hardin and Jensen, 2011,
    Colomina and Molina, 2014. Underwater, surface (i.e. water surface) and ground
    vehicles offer additional opportunities for autonomous data collection Subhan
    and Bhide (2014). They are particularly valuable in exploring regions that are
    difficult to access, such as at the scene of disasters, deep water exploration,
    or other dangerous conditions Subhan and Bhide, 2014, Bogue, 2010. A full review
    of underwater robots are available from Bogue (2010). Ground-based sensor networks
    and advanced metering: Ground-based sensor networks and advanced metering technologies
    provide a platform to collect data with high spatial and temporal resolution (in
    the absence of cost and siting constraints) Chong et al. (2003). However, since
    they are typically fixed, only local observations are derived by each individual
    sensor. Sensor networks have enabled large advances in ecology and environmental
    monitoring, but are also useful in the built sector. Metering and sensors make
    it easier to detect leakage and waste to facilitate efficient energy or water
    resource usage. By giving users real-time feedback, conservation can be promoted
    Sovacool and Gilbert (2014). However, advanced metering in the urban sector is
    often costly, especially in the case of water, which does not have a high enough
    economic value to validate such high resolution measurements. Privacy and concerns
    over increased regulation have also thwarted the large-scale dissemination of
    advanced metering National Institute of Standards and Technology (2010). 3.1.
    Remote sensing applications for water management Remote sensing technologies have
    transformed water management, especially in terms of assessing water resource
    availability and water quality. Satellite missions and UAVs have been used to
    monitor surface water sources. For example, remote sensing techniques have been
    used to detect changes to sea level over time El Rey (2011), changes to lake levels
    Crétaux and Birkett, 2006, Calmant and Seyler, 2006, Gao et al., 2012, seasonal
    water storage Alsdorf et al. (2010) and flood inundation maps Khan et al. (2011).
    More recent developments have made it possible to identify the location of, and
    spatio-temporal changes to, groundwater storage Jasmin and Mallikarjuna, 2011,
    Sahoo et al., 2011, Famiglietti, 2014, Gao et al., 2012. Satellite data from the
    Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration (NASA) mission indicate changes to the gravitational anomaly across
    earth, in time and space. Since water is so heavy, this anomaly is correlated
    to volumetric water transfers. Thus, with some analysis, the global terrestrial
    water budget, and hence, changes to groundwater storage can be quantified Sahoo
    et al., 2011, Famiglietti, 2014, Gao et al., 2012, Alsdorf et al., 2010. Digital
    elevation data from NASA''s Shuttle Topography Radar Mission (STRM) in conjunction
    with Landsat data, and geological maps, have also been used to characterize groundwater
    potential Hammouri et al. (2012). Remote sensing technologies have also improved
    our understanding of water quality without the burden of expensive and labor-intensive
    field work. Data from satellites have been used to assess water quality of inland
    and coastal waters, such as real-time measurements of sea salinity or the proliferation
    of Chlorophyll-a concentrations, for example Keramitsoglou et al., 2006, Chen
    et al., 2013, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012. Changes to water temperature can also
    be detected using remote sensing techniques. For example, thermal infrared remote
    sensing images have been used to detect temperature anomalies in order to locate
    groundwater discharge to surface water Wilson and Rocha (2014) or to detect thermal
    pollution from industrial sources Diehl et al., 2013, Dai et al., 2012, Zhu et
    al., 2014. Autonomous Surface Vehicles, which float along the surface of a water
    body, have enabled data collection at the surface of the water source itself,
    although creating autonomy and navigation functions continue to be a challenge
    Pinto et al. (2013). The aquatic environment also complicates the development
    of these and robotic technologies for water resource monitoring. Although satellite
    data have been used for water management applications, this area of research is
    still nascent but growing. Researchers in Los Angeles have used vegetation and
    land use satellite data to estimate residential water usage Mini et al. (2014).
    Developing technologies to detect leaks in pipelines via sensors has been an initiative
    for decades. Sensor networks for the real-time monitoring of water (or other fluid)
    pipeline infrastructure are advancing, but faces technical challenges Perelman
    and Ostfeld, 2013, Sun et al., 2011. Wireless sensors still suffer from connectivity
    issues when installed underground, while wired applications are susceptible to
    damage, and thus very costly to maintain Sun et al. (2011). Improving (and reducing
    the cost of) monitoring applications across urban water supply networks offers
    important opportunities to increase the efficacy of water management. 3.2. Remote
    sensing applications in the energy sector Remote sensing technologies are becoming
    common to energy and energy infrastructure management. In addition to advanced
    meters that offer energy consumption data with unprecedented temporal and spatial
    fidelity, UAVs and satellite data offer insight into energy infrastructure management,
    disaster relief efforts, environmental impact assessments, as well as energy production
    potential and consumption patterns. Remote sensing technologies also offer opportunities
    to automate the inspection of energy facilities and related infrastructure, reducing
    the cost of doing business. Devices are being deployed that can reduce risk to
    human health and well-being when environments are unfit for human interactions,
    such as in periods following natural or human caused disasters. The development
    of inexpensive sensors has also allowed for significant increases in remote environmental
    monitoring, which has made it more cost effective to detect risks (i.e., wildfires
    and other extreme events) to built infrastructure such as power lines. There are
    many applications for which remote sensing technologies, UAVs in particular, have
    been utilized to monitor and inspect energy infrastructure. UAVs have been used
    to inspect power linesDeng et al., 2014, Odido et al., 2013, power plants Duncan
    and Murphy, 2014, Oyama et al., 2013, Hiromoto et al., 2014, Leva et al., 2015
    and petrochemical facilities Huerzeler et al. (2012). Aerial technologies are
    especially helpful in performing tedious inspections for infrastructure spanning
    large distances or square areas. In Kenya, UAVs are being used to inspect powerlines,
    increasing the reliability of a system previously thwarted by vandalism and poor
    upkeep Odido et al. (2013). UAVs are also being used to take aerial photographs
    of solar Photovoltaic installations to detect cracks and failures in systems spanning
    large expanses Leva et al. (2015). UAVs have also provided many critical monitoring
    services before and after energy-related disasters. For example, autonomous UAVs
    have been used for assessing radiological responses after incidents at nuclear
    power stations Duncan and Murphy, 2014, Oyama et al., 2013, Hiromoto et al., 2014.
    Similarly, UAVs have been used to monitor conditions following coal mine disasters
    when conditions have been detrimental to the health of emergency response crews
    Subhan and Bhide (2014). Robotic-assisted sensors are also being developed for
    infrastructure monitoring. Devices called “snake-arm robots”, which are long,
    flexible robots that can enter and “snake” through environments inhospitable to
    humans, are being utilized to perform inspection and maintenance tasks, within
    confined spaces, at nuclear power plant facilities Buckingham and Graham (2012).
    Mobile robots, which include flying and climbing robots, have also been used for
    power line inspection, replacing two-person foot patrol and helicopter-assisted
    inspection Katrašnik et al. (2010). Crawling robots equipped with sensors are
    commonly used for the inspection and maintenance of oil and gas tanks for tasks
    such as cleaning, marine life removal, crack location and wall thickness inspection
    Kalra and Gu, 2007, Ledezma et al., 2015. In off-shore oil and gas production,
    multi-sensor robotic systems are being used to inspect production risers (i.e.,
    vertical pipes that bring oil, natural gas and water to the production platform
    from the wellhead) Santos et al. (2013). Robots offer advantages over other inspection
    modes including human divers, remotely operated vehicles, and autonomous underwater
    vehicles, as each has limitations that include risks to human life, high costs
    and an inability to get close to the riser (in the case of vehicles) Bogue, 2010,
    Santos et al., 2013. Although robotic sensors offer a potentially cost effective
    way to achieve more detailed monitoring in these harsh environments, they are
    still constrained by technical limitations such as operational vertical depths
    Santos et al. (2013). Autonomous underwater vehicles, also utilized for surveying
    sub-sea surfaces prior to energy or mineral resource development and monitoring
    water quality, are still more effective for returning data at very large depths
    Bogue (2010). For wind turbine development, where wind turbine blades have increased
    substantially in size over the years, climbing robots are being used to reduce
    the cost of inspection, which historically required dismantelling the turbine
    or doing human inspections Sattar et al. (2009). Satellites are also collecting
    data to measure the environmental impacts of energy systems on the environment.
    Satellite data have been used to quantify the atmospheric release of pollution
    such as fugitive methane emissions Schneising et al. (2014), nitrogen oxide (NOX)
    emissions Beirle et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2012b, Wang et al., 2012 and Carbon
    Dioxide (CO2) emissions Velazco et al., 2011, Bovensmann et al., 2010. Although
    UAVs and airborne sensors can also measure similar emissions data (typically with
    higher spatio-temporal resolution than satellites) Šmídl and Hofman, 2013, Dennison
    et al., 2013, data collected with UAVs are generally more restricted in terms
    of the potential spatial extent of a study Neumann et al. (2013). Remote sensing
    technologies are also proving valuable to surface and topological studies. For
    example, land surface data collected from UAVs and satellites have been used to
    analyze the impact of power plants on land surface temperature Okwen et al. (2011),
    while thermal remote sensing technologies have been used to analyze the impacts
    of geothermal exploitation on ground temperature Yang et al. (2011). UAVs have
    also been used to measure land deformation following large-scale solar power plant
    installations on marginal, reclaimed land sites where erosion is of concern Matsuoka
    et al. (2012). Techniques have been developed to measure renewable energy resource
    potential (e.g., solar radiation and wind measurements)Morelli et al., 2015, Colomina
    and Molina, 2014, as well as energy consumption (e.g., via nighttime light satellite
    imagery) Elvidge et al., 1997, Ghosh et al., 2010, Amaral et al., 2005, Doll and
    Pachauri, 2010. These applications can be especially valuable in remote regions
    where reliable data are not frequently collected. Several remote sensing application
    have increased data gathering at the interface of energy and water resource management.
    Monitoring hydroelectric facilities has been a common remote sensing application
    coordinating the management of energy and water resources. Remote sensing data
    have enabled the mapping of large hydroelectric reservoirs to estimate water storage
    and energy generation potential Curtarelli et al. (2014b), as well as changes
    to water levels hydroelectric facilities Mustafa and Noori, 2013, Coskun et al.,
    2010. Furthermore, remote sensing has been used to study phytoplankton proliferation
    in hydroelectric dams to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of water quality
    changes Curtarelli et al., 2014a, Curtarelli et al., 2014b. Collecting image-based
    data from satellite and UAVs has proven a valuable resource for assessing the
    impacts of energy production on water quality. Satellite and airborne imagery
    have been fundamental in evaluating the aftermath of oil spills in aquatic environments
    Leifer et al., 2012, Brekke and Solberg, 2005, Fingas and Brown, 2014, Keramitsoglou
    et al., 2006. (A detailed review of remote sensing technologies for oil spills
    is available from Fingas and Brown (2014).) These methods of data collection were
    critical to assessing damages during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill Kokaly
    et al. (2013). In addition to chemical and biological changes to quality, satellite
    imagery has also been utilized to determine thermal water pollution. For example,
    satellite data have been used to detect water quality changes at the site of a
    single thermoelectric power plant Diehl et al. (2013), while infrared cameras
    have been used to monitor thermal discharge from thermal power plants Zhu et al.,
    2014, Dai et al., 2012. 3.3. Remote sensing applications in the agricultural sector
    The use of remote sensing technologies for agricultural management is becoming
    increasingly pervasive, especially in the context of precision agriculture Atzberger
    (2013). Image-based remote sensing for precision crop management has been utilized
    for decades, but advances in aerial hyperspectral imagery have drastically improved
    the identification and differentiation of nutrients, pests, crop disease, weeds,
    and canopy structure to improve crop management Moran et al., 1997, Mulla, 2012.
    UAVs, in particular, have provided a means to retrieve high resolution images
    for precision crop management Primicerio et al., 2012, Hassan-Esfahani et al.,
    2014, Zhang and Kovacs, 2012, Mulla, 2012, Urbahs and Jonaite, 2013, Odido et
    al., 2013. Additionally, remotely piloted vehicles, remotely operated aircraft,
    and remotely controlled helicopters are also important applications for precision
    agriculture Zhang and Kovacs (2012). For example, vehicles have been developed
    to spray chemicals without human intervention Gázquez et al. (2016). The coupling
    of UAVs and ground-based wireless sensor networks have enabled the remote application
    of pesticides and fertilizers to fields Braun et al., 2012, Faiçal et al., 2014.
    In addition to imagery, general reflectometry and the three-dimensional (3D) mapping
    of vegetation spectral dynamics have provided insight into agricultural productivityEgido
    et al., 2012, Dandois and Ellis, 2013. (Detailed reviews of UAVs for precision
    agriculture are available from Zhang and Kovacs, 2012, Mulla, 2012.) Robots and
    automation have also increased the efficacy of precision agriculture, through
    technologies such as tractor guidance and agricultural robots to cultivate, harvest,
    and control diseases. Current research efforts focus on increasing the efficiency
    of robots utilized for precision agriculture by improving their autonomy so that
    they can be deployed with little human intervention and/or supervision, as well
    as developing fleets of robots that can work together to more efficiently perform
    a task Jensen et al., 2014, Emmi et al., 2013, Bibuli et al., 2007. Remote sensing
    data have made it easy to characterize changes to land use, deforestation, vegetation
    patterns, and disease. For example, satellite images have been used to distinguish
    between vegetated areas and non-vegetated areas via Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) Liu et al. (2012). Both UAVs and satellite data have been utilized
    to estimate crop area Pan et al., 2011, Verger et al., 2014. These techniques
    have also been applied to monitor changes to vegetative health, such as the persistence
    of disease across agricultural areas Mirik et al. (2011) or the impact of drought
    on crop production Zhang et al. (2014). Hence, these technologies have been critical
    to gaining a better understanding of how drought probability and persistence Rojas
    et al. (2011), as well as climate change, impacts growing season and crop characteristics
    Brown et al. (2012). Data collection via remote sensing technologies is becoming
    more and more common for monitoring issues at the interface of water and agriculture.
    These applications span satellites, UAVs, robots and high resolution metering,
    among other applications, and have helped manage water resources for farming operations.
    For example, applications that transmit data between meters and satellites have
    been used by the Idaho State Water Department to help farmers manage water Summitt
    (2011). Remote sensing has also improved understanding of the water balances governing
    the uptake and release of water by plants. An enhanced vegetation index has been
    developed to estimate average annual groundwater discharge by vegetation, which
    is correlated to evapotranspiration Tillman et al. (2012). Evapotranspiration
    has also been measured by constructing surface energy balances through the use
    of short-wave and long-wave (thermal) satellite images, elevation data and weather
    data Allen et al., 2007, Hafeez et al., 2007, Tang et al., 2009. Similarly, satellite
    data can be used to monitor soil moisture with course resolution Gopperundevi
    et al., 2012, Allen et al., 2011, while spherical robots offer precision moisture
    monitoring on the ground Hernández et al. (2013). Similarly, UAVs equipped with
    a micro-hyperspectral imagery and thermal camera have been effective in detecting
    water stress in plants Zarco-Tejada et al. (2012). Remote sensing technologies
    are also helping to identify when water is being withdrawn at unsustainable rates.
    For example, GRACE satellite data have been used to measure groundwater depletion
    rates in the Central Valley of California, among other agricultural centers Famiglietti
    et al., 2011, Famiglietti, 2014. Applications in poor countries such as Kenya
    are giving farmers access to automated surveying that is anticipated to increase
    yields and profits for farmers that previously performed visual inspections themselves
    Odido et al. (2013). New techniques have also made it possible to use remote sensing
    of land use/land cover data in combination with fieldwork sampling to map groundwater
    pollution Srivastava et al., 2011, Singh et al., 2011, Srivastava et al., 2013.
    Remote sensing applications at the interface of energy and agriculture have also
    been developed. Many of these efforts have been dedicated to reducing costs and
    increasing yields by optimizing the energy consumption of farm equipment (e.g.,
    tractors, balers, etc.) via satellite based Global Positioning System (GPS) monitoring
    Bell, 2000, Gan-Mor et al., 2007. Other applications described more generally
    above are also pertinent in terms of monitoring biofuel crop production and the
    water quality impacts of biofuels production with remote sensing technologies.
    4. Opportunities for improving nexus management Despite the advances that remote
    sensing technologies have had on resource management, there are still large improvements
    that can be made to enable more holistic management of the energy-water-agriculture
    nexus. Some recommendations are presented here. Preemptive and continuous monitoring
    of infrastructure: Ecological sensing applications with UAVs have proven useful,
    especially when combined with environmental sensor networks and numerical models
    Anderson and Gaston, 2013, Vivoni et al., 2014. Integrating the collection of
    ecological data with built infrastructure monitoring will continue to increase
    the efficacy with which human systems can integrate with natural systems, without
    creating a large environmental impact. Although there exist many applications
    where natural systems adjacent to large industrial operations are monitored, all
    too often, data collection begins after a large incidents occur (e.g., after an
    oil or coal ash spill). New technologies should be developed to monitor environmental
    systems subject to risk in real-time to enable more timely responses to accidents.
    For example, improved real time monitoring of onshore (and offshore) oil and gas
    well integrity could address issues, such as faulty casings and cementing, before
    large damages are incurred. Although the use of tracers can allow incidents of
    groundwater contamination back to the source, better monitoring could reduce the
    risk of contamination incidents as a whole. Policing activities leading to environmental
    degradation: Remote sensing technologies can also provide monitoring of illegal
    activity that can negatively affect ecosystems or infrastructures but that have
    been too expensive to monitor with human intervention in the past. For example,
    in marine environments, illegal fisheries and piracy continue to degrade fish
    populations and economic growth in coastal communities. Satellite-imagery and
    UAVs are beginning to be disseminated to monitor these activities in ways that
    were not previously possible Odido et al. (2013). These technologies can also
    be effective in the real-time monitoring of physical intrusions by humans into
    critical systems in remote areas such as oil and gas pipelines or power or water
    infrastructure, and signal alarms of response if needed using geo-referenced locations
    Roper and Dutta (2005). In addition to monitoring functions, satellite and ground-based
    sensors can help identify illegal discharge of pollution, solid waste or other
    destructive and illegal activities such as deforestation Odido et al. (2013).
    Automated measurements of emissions from energy consumption and animal based production
    facilities can enable new reporting and regulatory frameworks to be more diligent
    about non-point water contamination, climate change action or air quality improvements.
    Coordinating multi-sensor networks to improve disaster response: On occasions
    when contamination events occur, remote sensing technologies must move past simple,
    image-based photos to more comprehensive detection and quantification of contaminant
    plumes. Most methods of oil spill surveillance, for example, still include simple
    still or video photographs via UAVs that are not effective in translating the
    three-dimensional propagation of contaminant plumes in time. However, the use
    of radar sensors via satellites is growing and emerging techniques using more
    advanced optical techniques, laser fluorosensors, microwave, acoustic sensors,
    are being developed to improve the detection of oil slicks on the surface, as
    well as oil in the water column Fingas and Brown (2014). Greater coordination
    between ground-based sensor network placement and mobile sensing devices will
    also improve the quality of the data collected during contamination events Bogue
    (2010). As the cost of remote sensing applications continue to decrease, more
    ubiquitous networks of ground-based, UAVs (or water-based remotely operated-vehicles)
    and satellite data will offer these capabilities. More generally, UAVs can be
    deployed over the extent of an area affected by natural or human caused disasters,
    collecting aerial photos of damage caused to multiple critical infrastructures.
    While utilizing remote sensing technologies for post-disaster management has really
    just ramped up over the past decade, there are huge opportunities to accelerate
    emergency response rates and allocate resources such as water, food and energy
    to the areas that are in most need Adams et al. (2013). In addition to informing
    more optimal emergency response and resource allocation, collecting epidemiological
    and environmental data can help inform policies and actions to reduce human and
    environmental health vulnerability in the future Fornace et al. (2014). Monitoring
    non-point sources of pollution: Water quality impacts from agricultural production
    hubs continue to be a major source of water pollution that is not adequately covered
    by the U.S. Clean Water Act. Non-point sources of water pollution have been more
    difficult to police than point sources and, as a result, they are underregulated
    but still contribute a lot of water pollution. As satellite based water quality
    detection technologies improve, it will become more possible to systematically
    monitor the occurrence and causes of nutrient loading to water bodies adjacent
    to agricultural entities. For example, satellites can be used to detect algal
    blooms in coastal and inland waters that form as a result of high nutrient loading
    levels from upstream agricultural producers. Furthermore, remote sensing capabilities
    such as robotic weed regulation can reduce human labor costs, and make organic
    farming practices more cost effective, producing indirect benefits to soil and
    water quality. Reducing groundwater depletion: Remote sensing applications have
    already provided major improvements to the efficiency of agricultural management
    by enabling the automated detection and measurement of water stress, evapotranspiration
    rates, soil moisture measurements and optimal water use rates. However, state-of-the
    art field and irrigation management practices are still not utilized by a high
    percentage of farmers, so greater penetration of some of these remote sensing
    practices would build efficiencies, especially in terms of water use efficiencies
    in water-scarce regions. Despite advances, groundwater aquifers are still being
    exploited at unsustainable rates across the world Famiglietti (2014). For sustainable
    management in the long run, groundwater levels must be measured and reported Famiglietti,
    2014, Famiglietti et al., 2011. Satellite monitoring capabilities are making it
    possible to make very coarse observations about groundwater depletion over very
    large areas, but as data resolution improves, and these data will place pressure
    on regulators to protect non-renewable aquifers Famiglietti (2014). Similarly,
    while many years of electricity and/or water cost subsidies for rural irrigators
    have promoted groundwater depletion across the world King et al., 2013, Sanders
    et al., 2013, remote sensing will enable access to data that can help placate
    some of these broken policy initiatives. Optimizing infrastructure placement decisions:
    Remote sensing technologies should also be pursued to determine the optimal placement
    of energy infrastructure, such as oil pipelines, renewable energy systems and
    power lines, to reduce tension with water and ecosystems. Similarly, remote sensing
    can facilitate energy, mineral and water resource discovery with less invasive
    disruptions. Today, human foot patrol and aerial surveillance, with planes or
    helicopters, are still widely used to monitor and inspect infrastructure crossing
    long distances, such as aqueducts, oil and gas pipelines, and power lines, which
    is costly and time consuming Roper and Dutta (2005). Satellite-based technologies
    are already enabling better pipeline monitoring through the detection of changes
    to slope motion and ground movements to anticipate damage with geospatial accuracy
    Roper and Dutta (2005). Similarly, high-resolution satellite imagery is being
    used to determine the optimal locations for critical infrastructure and facility
    placement, which can reduce environmental impacts, especially when groundwater
    aquifers can be more accurately identified and mapped Roper and Dutta (2005).
    In more remote areas, these capabilities can signal the intrusion of destructive
    vegetation or offer improved disaster response when flooding or wildfires, for
    example, threaten or disrupt the functioning of existing infrastructure Colomina
    and Molina, 2014, Tan and Panda, 2011. In addition to improving the efficiency
    of resource exploration, radar sensors, for example, have improved water navigation,
    increasing fuel and cost efficiencies, while decreasing risks associated with
    water-based energy transport. Improving renewable energy integration: Remote sensing
    has markedly improved the forecasting of renewable and fossil energy resources,
    but there are still important advances that can help increase the efficacy of
    resource forecasts. Deriving better snowpack estimates, for example, could improve
    hydropower management based on better water supply forecasts. Better renewable
    energy assessments will continue to enable the increased penetration of intermittent,
    but water-lean renewables on the grid. Smart sensing can inform the timing and
    frequency of cleanings for solar Photovoltaic cells to optimize the balance between
    performance and water usage. Similarly, new technologies will facilitate the better
    mapping of oil and mineral exploration through 3D models, to reduce the occurrence
    of wells drilled with no resource production. Monitoring water quality adjacent
    to power plants: Over the past decade, the water requirements and water quality
    impacts of thermoelectric power plants have received increasing attention. The
    Energy Information Administration (EIA) has become more diligent in requiring
    power plants to report data about their cooling water withdrawals and diversions,
    as well as when they risk exceeding thermal discharge temperatures EIA, 2015,
    EIA, 2014, Madden et al., 2013. However, it is well recognized that these self-reported
    data to the EIA by power plant operators are often erroneous US GAO, 2009a, King
    et al., 2013, Sanders et al., 2014, and do not offer data with the temporal fidelity
    to adequately assess risk to power plant reliability or ecosystem health Sanders
    et al. (2014). Remote sensing can facilitate monitoring of cooling water sources
    for power plant by combining thermal imagery by UAVs and/or smart temperature
    sensor networks to monitor temperature fluctuations. These data would provide
    the opportunity to quantitatively assess how thermal plumes from power plants
    change daily and seasonally and affect the health of ecosystems and fish mortality.
    To date, data are not resolved enough to develop a quantitative understanding
    of these impacts, despite the fact that new regulatory instruments are in place
    to try to reduce ecological impacts from thermoelectric power plants Sanders (2015).
    More data would enable the assessment of the efficacy of these regulations on
    cooling water systems to inform future build outs. In addition to protecting ecosystems,
    these data could also inform the better management of thermal waste heat discharged
    by power plant facilities. Additionally, deploying technologies to measure consumptive
    losses might improve the placement of future facilities in water-scarce watershed,
    as well as water management across the watershed in general. Enabling “smart”
    sensors for infrastructure monitoring: In the built sector, smart energy meters,
    in combination with demand response programs, are already being deployed in many
    cities to better align energy consumption patterns with grid-scale reliability
    issues Rhodes et al. (2014). Although water meters are not widely deployed due
    to the cost of meters compared to the economic returns of water efficiency, studies
    in the literature have utilized smart water meters to study the tradeoffs of urban
    water configuration Chao et al. (2015). Real-time water metering and pressure
    sensors will enable the detection of, and repair of, water leaks, which are responsible
    for 14% of treated water losses in the US Hering et al. (2013). Pressure sensors
    will also make it possible to detect and relieve parts of the water distribution
    system that are overpressurized, or increase pressure automatically for fire-fighting
    purposes Hering et al. (2013). Aerial and hand-held thermal infrared remote sensing
    technologies have made it possible to detect energy losses in buildings via water
    leaks and other inefficiencies. While cost still prohibits the widespread expansion
    of sensor and metering networks, especially in water distribution networks, new
    business models and smarter data analytics will continue to increase value to
    the user. Additionally, efficiencies can be achieved if applications are able
    to provide insight across multiple resource networks. For example, energy consumption
    signatures might be able offer insight about hot water usage or hot water leakages;
    improved disaggregation techniques are also enabling more insight about the energy
    or water consumption of individual devices based on smart meter data at the house
    level Perez et al. (2014). Enabling communication between sensor networks and
    devices: Interest in smart grids, “Smart Cities” and the “Internet of Things”
    could fundamentally transform the way that infrastructures communicate, and resources
    are managed, in the built sector Miorandi et al. (2012). These advancements will
    rely on ubiquitous sensing networks that can measure, infer, understand and improve
    resource management in urban environments. By combining wireless technologies,
    sensors and actuators, devices can communicate to more efficiently anticipate
    users'' needs and preferences Gubbi et al. (2013). This concept of the “Internet
    of Things” will enable devices such as climate control devices, home appliances
    and distributed renewable energy resources to communicate, anticipate user preferences,
    respond to provide services to users in ways that also promote resource efficiency
    and system reliability autonomously, without much user intervention Aburukba (2015).
    This transformation will be predicated on the efficient and effective use of sensor
    networks that are redundant, stable and self-healing Fadlullah et al. (2011).
    5. Challenges to be addressed In a resource-constrained world, the holistic management
    of energy, water and agricultural production systems is of unprecedented importance.
    Although more attention has been devoted to integrated energy, water, and agricultural
    management in recent years, there are still barriers to be overcome. Below are
    a series of challenges that must be addressed in order to move towards integrated
    resource management and how remote sensing applications might help overcome these
    challenges. Fragmented expertise and institutions: Expertise regarding energy,
    water and agriculture is often siloed Scott et al. (2011). For example, energy
    experts might not be knowledgeable on water issues, while water experts might
    not understand energy data. Similarly, institutional boundaries can limit data
    coordination for multiple resources. These trends have resulted in fragmented
    urban infrastructure development, whereas adopting a systems approach to urban
    planning would increase the productivity, efficiency and resiliency of the built
    sector Pandit et al. (2015). Remote sensing helps placate these issues through
    the democratization of data through global satellite missions that collect and
    disseminate data for public usage. However, assessing multiple resources will
    still require coordination from experts across a wide range of expertise, across
    many organizations, to efficiently and effectively deploy multi-resource monitoring
    applications. Mismatched spatio-temporal resolution: Collecting data at the optimum
    tempo-spatial-spectral scale for planning and risk avoidance will be key to optimize
    investment decisions regarding future data acquisition techniques. Energy, water,
    and agriculture data are relevant on various temporal and spatial scales. For
    example, in the energy sector, oil, natural gas, and coal resources are traded
    via contracts that establish the quantity and price of the resource to be purchased
    in the future and all are traded over different spatial extents NERC (2013). Electricity,
    on the other hand, is generated in day-ahead and real-time markets, according
    to the instantaneous load NERC (2013). For water resource management, snowpack
    and surface storage volumes fluctuate seasonally, while flooding due to extreme
    events can occur unexpectedly, as can events that degrade water quality. Since
    various classes of remote sensing technologies have various strengths and challenges
    in terms of data collection capabilities in space and time, it is important to
    match data collection methods with applications King et al. (2013). Cheaper forms
    of remote sensing, as well as cheaper data storage, make it possible to measure
    and store data with high spatio-temporal resolution, so that the data on the relevant
    scale of interest can be collected across multiple resources. Data management
    issues: There are many outstanding data collection and management issues to be
    worked out in regards to remote sensing data techniques. In terms of data acquisition,
    issues regarding privacy and property-rights need to be sorted out to support
    the large scale collection of data, without infringing on consumer rights or security
    National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010, Gubbi et al., 2013. Frameworks
    to support the open and affordable dissemination of data and data products will
    also be important to avoid the monetization of data by private parties that might
    have access to sophisticated acquisition technologies Westley et al. (2011). These
    frameworks for data collection and dissemination might be facilitated by leveraging
    private-partnerships to fund data acquisition, so that the burden is not on the
    public sector alone Beck and Villarroel Walker (2013). Data storage and processing
    can also be a challenge as data are generally collected with such high temporal
    resolution that choosing how to interpret and manage data effectively is not always
    straight forward. Managing large data sets effectively and efficiently in a format
    that facilitates analysis presents difficulties. Determining effective modes of
    data storage for data-rich applications and creating protocols for standardizing
    and archiving data are challenging. Although the costs of data storage have decreased
    substantially, decisions will need to be made on whether all data should be archived
    or filtered to isolate interesting aspects, and for how long these data should
    be archived. Better data formatting standards and storage will also help facilitate
    open source dissemination to anyone that wants to access the data Beniston et
    al. (2012). Finally, there are outstanding issues regarding how data are interpreted
    and presented to consumers. Disseminating insights from data-rich applications
    in a targeted, timely and concise manner is the ultimate goal for these applications,
    but requires new modes of data processing and interpretation. Strategies have
    to be devised to process data to derive timely and concise analytical insights,
    as the collection of massive datasets that are simply stored without complimentary
    analytics offer very little utility. Data analysts must determine who their data
    “customers” are, how much data they desire, and how to communicate effectively
    with them through analytics and applications. Maintaining consumer attention and
    feedback has been a challenge to many new analytics companies, so creating interfaces
    that continue to engage consumers will be a challenge to overcome. For monitoring
    applications, an existing challenge is to determine appropriate thresholds or
    alarm criteria to alert pertinent parties to varying levels of risk. With so much
    data being collected, analytics must be effective in analyzing data in ways that
    meet an end-user''s priorities Gubbi et al. (2013). Cost and deployment issues:
    To date, sensors are typically deployed to collect data regarding an isolated
    system or resource (i.e., energy consumption, water leakages, seismic activity).
    By (1) identifying the critical interdependencies and potential vulnerabilities
    among interdependent human and natural systems, and (2) determining how remote
    sensing technologies can be utilized to derive insight across multiple critical
    resource and lifeline infrastructure systems, progress can be made in increasing
    the efficiency and efficacy of environmental and infrastructure monitoring efforts.
    Cost savings can be increased by coupling the monitoring of systems that have
    similar characteristics and communication requirements. By increasing the capability
    of sensors and data collection missions, the dissemination of interconnected sensors
    and data collection networks can be accelerated. For many applications, different
    types of technologies can be deployed together, for example, ground-based sensors
    and aerial vehicles for precision agriculture, to leverage the benefits of each
    technology. Furthermore, improving disaggregation and triangulation techniques
    can reduce the amount of sensors or meters required for ground-based networks
    Colomina and Molina (2014). Policy issues: Perhaps most challenging, are not the
    technical issues surrounding remote sensing technologies, but the policy issues.
    Policies regarding the use of air space, for example, has curtailed the wide-scale
    dissemination of UAVs, despite the large market potential for these devices, especially
    in the agricultural sector Freeman and Freeland, 2014, Vivoni et al., 2014, Hardin
    and Jensen, 2011. Issues regarding policy challenges are discussed in more detail
    by Freeman and Freeland, 2014, Hardin and Jensen, 2011, Watts et al., 2012, Rango
    and Laliberte, 2010. Other significant issues relate to the complex interaction
    between socioeconomic and political issues related to built-in subsidies impacting
    the energy-water agriculture nexus Tortajada, 2006, Sanders et al., 2013, Madani,
    2014. Life-cycle assessment considerations: Life cycle assessment is becoming
    an increasingly important tool for evaluating environmental systems. However,
    this field is challenged by the difficulty of achieving consistency among studies
    as different studies use different system boundaries, spatio-temporal perspectives,
    and calculation procedures Guinée et al. (2011). For example, a review of life
    cycle assessments of biological wastewater treatment studies concludes that methodological
    shortcomings still restrict the utility of comparing LCA results Zang et al. (2015).
    In water quantity studies, results can vary according to what type of indicator
    is used to assess water use, for example a fuel''s blue water (i.e. water withdrawn
    from lakes, streams, aquifers, etc.) or green water footprint (i.e. soil moisture
    available to plants from precipitation) Hagman et al. (2013). Spatial resolution
    is also important as life cycle environmental impacts can be impacted by regional
    criteria. For example, the water footprint of biofuels and food crops are highly
    dependent on where agricultural feedstocks are cultivated Su et al., 2014, Hess
    et al., 2015. Remote sensing data, could offer an opportunity to offer repeatable
    analyses as data can be collected and analyzed with standard methods across standard
    spatio-temporal scales. For example, satellite data are being used for emissions
    accounting in LCA studies, which avoids inconsistency across datasets Rodríguez-Alloza
    et al. (2015). 6. Conclusions Despite existing challenges, remote sensing offers
    unprecedented opportunities for holistic resource management. This article has
    synthesized a collection of work dedicated to energy, water and/or agricultural
    management by researchers in the remote sensing community and suggests ways that
    these emerging technologies can assist in the area of integrated management. This
    article discusses key opportunities and challenges that should be explored by
    the energy, water and agricultural nexus community. By linking these research
    communities, remote sensing technologies can be developed to achieve better and
    more targeted remote sensing applications that will assist in integrated resource
    management. As more environmental sensors and large-scale missions are carried
    out, more attention should be dedicated to maximizing the benefit and insight
    that these efforts can derive across multiple critical resource and lifeline infrastructures.

    Technological Forecasting and Social Change Citation Excerpt : Despite the successful
    history of water resources development, there is a growing body of literature
    recognizing that unsustainable decisions can create or intensify the water problems
    because of secondary consequences in the long run (Gleick, 1998; Cai et al., 2003).
    To address these concerns, the nexus concept has been widely used to better understand
    the inter-linkages between water-energy (Li et al., 2019a, 2019b; Larsen and Drews,
    2019), water-food (Kumar et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2021), water-land (Sanders and
    Masri, 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019a, 2019b; Mehrazar et al., 2020),
    and water-energy-food nexus (Artioli et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019a, 2019b; Daher
    et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2020). To better understand the dynamic behaviors and
    feedback within urban water system, the inclusion of human-natural environment
    nexus called socio-hydrology is essential (Konar et al., 2019; Di Baldassarre
    et al., 2019; Li and Sivapalan, 2020). Show abstract Optimal crop planting pattern

    collection from unreachable terrain and then transmit the information to the sink
    is a fundamental task in periodic sensor networks. Energy is a major constraint
    for this network as the only source of energy is a battery with limited lifetime.
    Therefore, in order to keep the networks operating for long time, adaptive sampling
    approach to periodic data collection constitutes a fundamental mechanism for energy
    optimization. The key idea behind this approach is to allow each sensor node to
    adapt its sampling rates to the physical changing dynamics. In this way, over-sampling
    can be minimised and power efficiency of the overall network system can be further
    improved. In this paper, we present an efficient adaptive sampling approach based
    on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements varies over time. Then,
    we propose a multiple levels activity model that uses behavior functions modeled
    by modified Bezier curves to define application classes and allow for sampling
    adaptive rate. The proposed method was successfully tested in a real sensor data
    set. Published in: 2013 9th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Sardinia, Italy SECTION I. Introduction Data
    collection from sensor networks can be made on demand, by bi-directional dialogs
    between the sensor nodes and the sink. A request for data is sent from the end
    user via the sink to the sensor nodes which, in turn, send the data back to the
    user. On the another hand, a second category of data collection, known as data
    streaming, whereby in monitoring applications, data flows primarily from the sensor
    node to the sink. In this category we distinguish the periodic sampling and the
    event driven data models. In the event driven model, the sensors monitor a region
    of interest to detect and report events to the sink, such as detecting human intruders.
    Event-based data collection is less demanding in terms of the amount of communication,
    since local filtering is performed within the network by the nodes themselves.
    The “periodic sampling” data model is characterized by the acquisition of sensor
    data from a number of remote sensor nodes and forwarded to the sink on a periodic
    basis. These periodic models are used for applications where certain conditions
    or processes need to be monitored constantly, such as the temperature or pressure,
    etc. Examples of these applications include the observation of nesting patterns
    of storm petrels at Great Duck Island [1], measuring light intensities at various
    heights in a redwood tree [2] and logging temperature and humidity in the canopy
    of potato plants for precision agriculture [3]. The sampling period in periodic
    data collection model depends mainly on how fast the condition or process varies
    and what intrinsic characteristics need to be captured. There are a couple of
    important design considerations associated with the periodic sampling data model.
    Sometimes, the dynamics of the monitored condition or process can slow down or
    speed up; if the sensor node can adapt its sampling rates to the changing dynamics
    of the condition or process, over-sampling can be minimised and power efficiency
    of the overall network system can be further improved. Another critical design
    issue is the phase relation among multiple sensor nodes. If two sensor nodes operate
    with identical or similar sampling rates, collisions between packets from the
    two nodes are likely to happen repeatedly. It is essential for sensor nodes to
    be able to detect this repeated collision and introduce a phase shift between
    the two transmission sequences in order to avoid further collisions. Various data
    aggregation methods have been proposed in the literature to eliminate the inherent
    redundancy in raw data collected from periodic sensor networks [4], [5], [6].
    Hence, adaptive sampling helps to reduce the number of samples by exploiting either
    spatial or temporal correlations between sensed data. A temporal correlation of
    data is used in [7], where the authors propose an adaptive sampling scheme suitable
    to snow monitoring for avalanche forecast. In [8], the authors proposed a centralized
    adaptive method, where the sampling rate is derived based on a Kalman filter.
    In this case, the sink establishes the sampling rate of nodes. Spatial data correlation
    is used in [9], where a backcasting scheme is proposed. The main idea is that,
    nodes deployed with sufficient density do not have to sample the sensed field
    in a uniform way. In fact, more nodes have to be active in the regions where the
    variation of the sensed data quantity is high. In this work a cluster based method
    is used to group sensors in clusters, each managed by a cluster-head. The authors
    in [10] define a spatial Correlation based Collaborative MAC protocol (CC-MAC)
    that regulates sensor node transmissions so as to minimize the number of reporting
    nodes while achieving the desired level of distortion. In [11] a TA-PDC-MAC protocol
    is proposed, a traffic adaptive periodic data collection MAC which is designed
    in a TDMA fashion. This work is designed in the ways that it assigns the time
    slots for nodes activity due to their sampling rates in a collision avoidance
    manner. Adaptive Sampling Approach to Data Collection (ASAP) is proposed in [12].
    This technique splits the network into clusters. A cluster formation phase is
    performed to elect cluster heads and select which nodes belong to a given cluster.
    The metrics used to group nodes within the same cluster include the similarity
    of sensor readings and the hop count. Then, not all nodes in a cluster are required
    to sample the environment. Adaptive sampling techniques are very promising, because
    of their efficiency to optimize energy consumption and the network overload. However,
    most of the previous proposed solutions are implemented in a centralized manner
    that requires rather huge computations and communications. Other existing methods
    are limited to only space correlation and based on grouping nodes into clusters.
    In this paper that specifically addresses periodic sensor networks, we propose
    a non-complex distributed adaptive sampling algorithm that is based on the sensed
    data variation. Moreover, we take into account the application criticality and
    propose a model that dynamically defines multiple levels of sampling rate corresponding
    to how many samples are captured per unit of time. The final goal is to provide
    the necessary algorithmic support for environmental surveillance applications
    to express their objectives. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In
    section II we present our model of adaptive sampling rate based on the variance
    study. In section III we describe how to integrate the application critically
    level in order to adapt the sampling rate. Section IV presents our experimental
    results based on real data readings. We show that our model performs well and
    allows to dynamically adapt its sample rate in order to save its energy consumption.
    Finally we end by some concluding remarks. SECTION II. Adapting Sampling Rate
    A. Variance study In this section we perform a statistical model allowing to compare
    means of measures taken by a node in different periods. Based on this comparison
    a node will adapt its sampling rate. With a period p a sensor node takes several
    measures of temperature or humidity for example. To illustrate, we consider a
    sensor node n after J periods. The objective is to compute the variation between
    periods after every new period to adapt the sampling rate in function of the new
    variance. The variance between periods may be thought of as a signal of measures
    differences. Therefore, we use the one way ANOVA model to test of whether or not
    the means of several periods are all equal and if the variance differs from one
    period to another. We suppose that measures inside each period J are independent,
    with mean \overline{Y_{J}} and the variances of periods are equal \sigma{_J^2}=\sigma^{2}
    . Then the measure''s variable can be written as follows: y_{ji}=\overline{Y_{j}}+\epsilon_{ji},
    \qquad j=1, \ldots, J;\qquad i=1 ,\ldots, n View Source Where \epsilon_{ji} are
    the residual which are independant and are normally distributed following N(0;\sigma^{2})
    . We denote by: \overline{Y_{j}}={1\over nj}\sum\ limits_{i=1}^{nj}y_{ji}, \sigma_{j}^{2}={1\over
    nj}\sum\ limits_{i=1}^{nj}(y_{ji}-\overline{Y_{j}})^{2}, \bar{Y} ={1\over n}\sum\
    limits_{i=1}^{nj}\sum\ limits_{j=1}^{J}y_{ji} View Source the mean and the variance
    in each period and the mean of all the J periods respectively. The total variation
    (ST) is the within period variation (SR) and the between period variation (SF).
    The whole idea behind the analysis of variance is to compare the ratio of between
    period variance to within period variance. If the variance caused by the interaction
    between the measures is much larger when compared to the variance that appears
    within each period, then it is because the means aren''t the same. Let us consider:
    \eqalignno{&ST=SR+SF\Rightarrow\cr\cr \sum\ limits_{j=1}^{J}\sum\ limits_{i=1}^{nj}(y_{ji}-\bar{Y})^{2}&=\sum\
    limits_{j=1}^{J}\sum\ limits_{i=1}^{nj}(y_{ji}-\overline{Y_{j}})^{2}+\sum\ limits_{j=1}^{J}nj\times(\overline{Y_{j}}-\overline{Y})^{2}&\hbox{(1)}}
    View Source B. Mean''s period verification In this section we present how each
    sensor after each period compare the means and computes the variance to then adapt
    its rate. After, a period J sensor node will test the hypothesis that all the
    previous period means and the new one are the same or not. Therefore we used the
    Fisher test, let F={SF/J-1\over SR/N-J} \eqno{\hbox{(2)}} View Source If the hypothesis
    is correct then, F will have an Fisher distribution, with F(J-1, N-J) degrees
    of freedom. The hypothesis is rejected if the F calculated from the measurements
    is greater than the critical value of the F distribution for some desired false-rejection
    probability (risk \alpha ). Let F_{t}=F_{1-\alpha}(J-1, N-J) . The decision is
    based on F and F_{t} : if F > F_{t} the hypothesis is rejected with false-rejection
    probability \alpha , and the variance between periods are significative. if F\leq
    F_{t} the hypothesis is accepted. C. Illustrative example Consider the measures
    and periods as shown in the following table. Table I MEASURES EXAMPLE Periods

    period we find F=8.066 and after the fourth period we find F=7.43 . SECTION III.
    Adaptation to Application Criticality A naïve approach to take into account the
    application criticality would consist in fixing the measure sampling rate of all
    sensor nodes to a given rate. As illustrated in Figure 1, we show how the sensor
    nodes capture speed can be regulated proportionally to the dynamic risk level
    r^{0} . For instance, a high criticality level pushes sensor nodes to capture
    at near the maximum sampling rate capability. The idea behind this model is, when
    the observed F become greater than threshold F_{t}(=\ F_{1-\alpha}) the sampling
    rate is balanced to the maximum sampling rate or to the minimum sampling rate
    in the other cases. However, this simple approach presents some drawbacks:(i)setting
    sensor nodes to work at full capacity provides high number of taken measures which
    need high bandwidth and leads to run out the sensor batteries and thus reducing
    the network lifetime,(ii)although setting the nodes at low capacity saves energy
    and extends the network lifetime, it provides poor data quality where some important
    measures will be missed,(iii)choosing a moderate sampling rate could balance between
    capture quality and network lifetime but at the same time sensors cannot be fully
    exploited if it is necessary and the physical changes are very dynamics. A. Dynamic
    sampling model To fully exploit the sensor node capabilities we propose that a
    node sampling rate depends on the result of the fisher test F as shown in figure
    2. Based on the results and residual of the variance test described above, the
    idea is that when a node noticed high variance differences, it can increases its
    sampling rate in order to prevent missing important measures and decreases its
    sampling rate when the variance are lesser than the threshold. In general, it
    is desirable to be able to adjust the sampling rate according to the application''s
    requirements. In our approach we express the application criticality by the quantitative
    variable r^{0} which can take values between 0 and 1 representing the low and
    the high criticality level respectively. Low level criticality indicates that
    the application does not require a high sampling rate while a high level criticality
    does. Then, according to the application''s requirements, r^{0} could be initialized
    accordingly into all sensors nodes prior to deployment. It is also possible during
    the network lifetime to dynamically change r^{0} , in all sensor nodes or for
    a given subset only, if some kind of supervision and control platform is available.
    In what follows we will define different application classes which will determine
    a node''s sampling rate. Figure 1. Naïve approach Show All Figure 2. Dynamic approach
    Show All 1) Influence on the F-ratio In this section, we discuss why the sampling
    rate increases when the F-ratio increases. In fact, the greater the difference
    among the means, the higher the F and the greater the likelihood of obtaining
    variance differences. Hence, it is important to note that a large F does not by
    itself convey why or how the means differ from each other. A high F value can
    be found when the means for all of the groups differ at least moderately from
    each other. Alternatively, a high F can be obtained when most of the means are
    fairly similar but one of the means happen to be far removed from the other means.
    In this last case, F ratio influenced by group means, where the variances intra
    groups are very different. In these two cases, the sensor node networks must increase
    its sampling rate to capture all physical changes. 2) Application classes We can
    broadly classify applications into different categories based on their criticality
    level. In our approach we define two classes of applications: high and low criticality
    applications. This criticality level is represented by a mathematical function
    y=f_{r^{0}}(F) that we call BV (BehaVior) function. This function can oscillate
    from hyperbolic to parabolic shape as illustrated in Figure 2: values on the x
    axis are positive results of Fisher test. These values lie between 1 and F_{t}
    . We consider, that F_{t} corresponds to the maximum sampling rate. Thus, if a
    node find a F greater than F_{t} it puts its sampling rate to the maximum. the
    y axis gives the corresponding sampling rate based on the Fisher test results
    on the x axis and the application criticality level (r^{0}) (number of sensed
    measures per unit of time). We now present the contrast between applications that
    exhibit high and low criticality level in terms of the BV function. Class 1 “low
    criticality”, 0\leq r^{0} < 0.5 : this class of applications does not need high
    sampling rate. This characteristic is represented by an hyperbolic BV function.
    As illustrated in figure 2 (box A), most projections of x values are gathered
    close to zero (i.e. the majority of the sensors will preserve their energy by
    sampling slowly). Class 2 “high criticality”, 0.5\leq r^{0}\leq 1 : This class
    of applications needs high sampling rate. This characteristic is represented by
    a parabolic BV function. As illustrated in figure 2 (box B), most projections
    of x values are gathered close to the max frame capture rate (i.e. the majority
    of nodes capture at a high rate). The behavior function: We use Bezier curve to
    model the BV function. Bezier curves are flexible and can plot easily a wide range
    of geometric curves. Definition 1:The bezier curve is a parametric form to draw
    a smooth curve. It is fulfilled through some points P_{0}, P_{1}\ldots P_{n} ,
    starting at P_{0} going towards P_{1}\ldots P_{n-1} and terminating at P_{n} .
    In our model we will use a Bezier curve with three points which is called a Quadratic
    Bezier curve. It is defined as follows: Definition 2:A quadratic Bezier curve
    is the path traced by the function B(t), given points P_{0}, P_{1}, and P_{2}
    . B(t)=(1-t)^{2}\ast P_{0}+2t(1-t)\ast P_{1}+t^{2}\ast P_{2}. \eqno{\hbox{(3)}}
    View Source The BV function is expressed by a Bezier curve that passes through
    three points: The origin point (P_{0}(0,0)) . The behavior point (P_{1}(b_{x},
    b_{y})) The threshold point (P_{2}(h_{x}, h_{y})) where h_{x} represents the highest
    cover cardinality and h_{y} represents the maximum frame capture rate determined
    by the sensor node hardware capabilities. As illustrated in Figure 3, by moving
    the behavior point P_{1} inside the rectangle defined by P_{0} and P_{2} , we
    are able to adjust the curvature of the Bezier curve. The BV function describes
    the application criticality. It takes \vert Co\vert as input on the x axis and
    returns the corresponding “frame capture rate” on the y axis. To apply the BV
    function with the Bezier curve, we modify this latter to obtain y as a function
    of x , instead of taking a temporal variable t as input to compute x and y . Based
    on the Bezier curve, let us now define the “BV function”: Definition 3:The BV
    function curve can be drawn through the three points P_{0}(0,0), P_{1}(b_{x},
    b_{y}) and P_{2}(h_{x}, h_{y}) using the Bezier curve as follows: \eqalignno{&\
    BV: [0, h_{x}] \rightarrow [0, h_{y}]\cr &\qquad \qquad \ X \rightarrow Y\cr \cr
    &BV_{P_{1},P_{2}}(X)=\cr &\cases{ {(h_{y}-2b_{y})\over 4b_{x}^{2}}X^{2}+{b_{y}\over
    b_{x}}X & $if(h_{x}-2b_{x}=0)$\cr (h_{y}-2b_{y})(\propto(X))^{2}+2b_{y}\propto(X),
    & $if(h_{x}-2b_{x}\neq 0)$ }\cr\cr&{ Where} \ \propto(X)={-b_{x}+\sqrt{b_{x}^{2}-2b_{x}\ast
    X+h_{x}\ast X}\over h_{x}-2b_{x}}\wedge\cases{0\leq b_{x}\leq h_{x}\cr 0\leq X\leq
    h_{x}\cr h_{x} > 0}&\hbox{(4)}} View Source 4) The criticality level r° As discussed
    above, the criticality level r^{0} of an application is given into the interval
    [0, [1]. According to this level, we define the criticality function called Cr
    which operates on the behavior point P_{1} to control the BV function curvature.
    According to the position of point P_{1} the Bezier curve will morph between parabolic
    and hyperbolic form. As illustrated in figure 3 the first and the last points
    delimit the curve frame. This frame is a rectangle and is defined by the source
    point P_{0}(0,0) and the threshold point P_{2}(h_{x}, h_{y}) . The middle point
    P_{1}(b_{x}, b_{y}) controls the application criticality. We assume that this
    point can move through the second diagonal of the defined rectangle b_{x}={-h_{y}\over
    h_{x}}\ast b_{y}+h_{y} . Figure 3. The Behavior curve functions Show All We define
    the Cr function as follows, such that varying r^{0} between 0 and 1 gives updated
    positions for P_{1} : \eqalignno{Cr: [0,1] \rightarrow [0, h_{x}]\ast[0, h_{y}]\cr
    &\qquad \quad r^{0} \rightarrow\ (b_{x}, b_{y})\cr Cr(r^{0})=\cases{ b_{x}=-h_{x}\times
    r^{0}+h_{x}\cr b_{y}=h_{y}\times r^{0} }&\hbox{(5)}} View Source Level r^{0} is
    represented by the position of point P_{1} . If r^{0}=0\ P_{1} will have the coordinate
    (h_{x}, 0) . If r^{0}=1\ P_{1} will have the coordinate (0, h_{y}) . B. Adapting
    Algorithm The adaptive sampling rate algorithm operates in rounds where each round
    equals m periods. For each round, every node decides to increase or decrease its
    sampling rate according to the variance condition and the application risk. The
    algorithm is presented in algorithm 1. SECTION IV. Experimental Results To verify
    our suggested approach, we conducted multiple series of simulations using a custom
    Java based simulator. The objective of these simulations is to confirm that our
    adaptive data collection technique can successfully achieve desirable results
    for energy conservation in periodic sensor networks. Therefore, in our simulations
    we used real readings collected from 45 sensor nodes deployed in the Intel Berkeley
    Research Lab [13]. Every 31 seconds, sensors with weather boards were collecting
    humidity, temperature, light and voltage values. For the sake of simplicity, in
    this paper we are interested in one field of sensor measurements: the temperature
    . We performed several runs of the algorithms. In each experimental run, each
    node reads periodically real measures and adapts its sampling rate after each
    round according to its BV function. We evaluated the performance of the algorithm
    using the following parameters: a) the time t ; b) m the number of periods per
    round; c) the application criticality level (r^{0}) . We employ two metrics in
    our simulations: SECTION Algorithm 1 Adapting rate algorithm the instantaneous
    sampling speed after each round; The overall energy dissipation. A. Instantaneous
    sampling rate The main goal of this section is to show how our algorithm is able
    to reduce and adapt its sampling rate according to the application criticality
    level. Figure 4 presents the results we obtained for the following parameters:
    a period is equal to approximatively 15 minutes; m={2} ; the maximum sampling
    rate is fixed to SM AX = 10 and \alpha=0.05 . The two curves confirms the good
    behavior of our algorithm. As we can see, the sampling rate is dynamically adapted
    according to the application criticality level i.e. r^{0}=0.2 and r^{0}=0.9 .
    We point out, that we performed some other experiments by varying the set of parameters.
    The detailed results can not be presented in this paper, due to the pages limitation,
    but they confirm the general behavior presented here. B. Energy consumption In
    this section we assume that a node has an energy level arbitrarily fixed to 1000
    units and that each measure consumes 0.125 unit. A period represents 10 measures,
    m=2 , SMAX = 5 and r^{0}=0.2 . In figure 5 we show how our algorithm allows to
    reduce the energy consumption. As we can see, compared to a non optimized sampling
    rate, our algorithm is able to provide a gain of about 25% of sensor lifetime.
    Figure 4. The sampling rate adaptation Show All Figure 5. The energy consumption
    Show All SECTION V. Conclusions We provided an adaptive sampling approach for
    energy efficient periodic data collection in sensor networks. We described two
    main mechanisms that form the core of our approach. First we study the sensed
    data between periods based on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements
    varies over time. Then, we proposed a multiple levels activity model that uses
    behavior functions modeled by modified Bezier curves to define application classes
    and allow each node to compute its sampling rate. We showed that our approach
    can be effectively used to increase the sensor network lifetime, while still keeping
    the quality of the collected data high. Our future work seeks firstly to adapt
    our proposed method to take into account the correlation between neiboring nodes;
    Secondly, to let our model able to adjust the sampling rate on the basis of the
    available energy beside the variation of F , while, at the same time minimizing

  title: Adaptive data collection approach for periodic sensor networks
  verbatim_quote1: '"We provided an adaptive sampling approach for energy efficient
    periodic data collection in sensor networks. We described two main mechanisms
    that form the core of our approach. First we study the sensed data between periods
    based on the dependence of conditional variance on measurements varies over time.
    Then, we proposed a multiple levels activity model that uses behavior functions
    modeled by modified Bezier curves to define application classes and allow each
    node to compute its sampling rate."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"We showed that our approach can be effectively used to increase
    the sensor network lifetime, while still keeping the quality of the collected
    data high. Our future work seeks firstly to adapt our proposed method to take
    into account the correlation between neiboring nodes; Secondly, to let our model
    able to adjust the sampling rate on the basis of the available energy beside the
    variation of F , while, at the same time minimizing the total uncertainty error."'

  analysis: 'Based on survey data collected at agricultural exhibitions in Germany,
    Reichardt and Jürgens (2009) analyzed the adoption, acceptance, and future potential
    of precision farming (PF) in the German agricultural sector. The results of their
    study indicate a gradual increase in farmer awareness and adoption of PF technologies
    from 2001 to 2007, with about 10% of farmers intending to implement PF in their
    operations within the next three years. However, the adoption rate of variable
    rate application techniques remains relatively low compared to data collection
    practices, and farmers primarily use PF methods to gather information rather than
    make variable rate application decisions.


    Reichardt and Jürgens (2009) also investigated the challenges farmers face in
    implementing PF. The most frequently cited obstacles include:

    - High cost of technology

    - Lack of compatibility between machinery and software from different manufacturers

    - Insufficient data handling and interpretation skills

    - Limited advisory and information services


    To address these challenges, Reichardt and Jürgens (2009) emphasize the importance
    of:

    - Providing better information services from the PF industry and advisory sector

    - Offering training courses to enhance farmers'' technical skills

    - Establishing reliable uniform standards to ensure compatibility of hardware
    and software

    - Reducing the cost of PF technology to make it more accessible to farmers


    Overall, Reichardt and Jürgens (2009) conclude that the future of PF in Germany
    depends on overcoming these challenges and fostering collaboration between farmers,
    industry, and advisory services to promote knowledge transfer and the adoption
    of more advanced PF practices.'

    3 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract The adoption of precision farming (PF)
    was studied on the basis of personal interviews conducted at several agricultural
    exhibitions in Germany. Between 6.65% and 11% of the interviewed farmers used
    PF. The majority used data collection techniques such as GPS-based area measurement
    and soil sampling rather than variable rate application techniques such as site-specific
    sowing and fertilising. Roughly half the farmers interviewed knew about PF. About
    7–10% of them intended to start using PF in the future. The results indicated
    that a large number of farmers did not even know what PF meant. In order to get
    more insight into this situation, several interviews were conducted with farmers
    already using PF techniques. A further study in 2005 of PF education in Germany
    indicated that, especially at vocational and technical schools, the subject was
    only covered to a small extent although the aim was to give a better coverage
    in future. At higher education levels, such as at universities and technical colleges,
    the teaching of PF was clearly better established. In order to promote awareness
    of PF among farmers, information and teaching materials adapted to the relevant
    educational levels were developed and tried out at training events. The main topics
    addressed were parallel tracking systems, site-specific nitrogen fertilising,
    yield mapping in grain production and the use of PDAs in crop farming. Finally,
    preliminary survey results are presented showing how knowledge about PF can best
    lead to its adoption and transfer into daily practice. Similar content being viewed

    12 September 2021 Introduction and objectives Precision farming, in the following
    abbreviated to PF, is an agricultural system approach that demands a high level
    of expertise (de Baey-Ernsten 2003). The concept of PF is primarily based on data
    collection, data processing and variable rate application of inputs (Blackmore
    et al. 2003). Most farmers using this technology are overburdened by its complexity.
    Often they do not use it effectively. Technical skills are definitely required
    for successful implementation of such computer-aided production processes. Acquisition
    and transfer of PF knowledge should be made as simple as possible (Probst et al.
    1999). Several studies of PF conducted in the USA, Great Britain, Denmark and
    Germany found that dissemination rate was much lower than expected (Arnholt et
    al. 2001; Fountas et al. 2005; Daberkow and McBride 2003; Pedersen et al. 2001;
    Pedersen et al. 2004; Reichardt and Jürgens 2007; Swinton and Lowenberg-Deboer
    2001). These studies highlighted the high costs involved and the time consuming
    learning process required as the primary factors behind the slow dissemination
    of PF knowledge. Previous surveys (Gumpertsberger and Jürgens 2003) also showed
    that a large number of farmers, especially younger ones, in Germany did not even
    know what PF stood for. Obviously there were still many teachers who do not supply
    state of the art PF information in their courses. Considering the rapid technological
    changes occurring throughout all facets of agriculture nowadays, it is important
    that relevant knowledge of PF techniques, management requirements and effects
    is supplied at all levels of education and professional training (Demel 2006;
    Doluschitz and Jungbluth 2004). To understand and encourage the dissemination
    process of PF knowledge based on the results of the German precision farming research
    projects, pre agro I (Hufnagel et al. 2004) and pre agro II, the acceptance, adoption
    and obstacles were investigated and activities undertaken to promote appropriate
    knowledge transfer. One of the main objectives of this study was to get a general
    idea about the adoption of PF in Germany among the different agricultural target
    groups and to find out how knowledge of PF can help final transfer into practice.
    It was thus important to get an overview of the different PF technologies implemented
    and to establish the problems encountered by farmers. The official advisory service
    in Germany plays an important role in informing farmers, so a further objective
    of the study was to obtain more information regarding the role of PF within the
    framework of the agricultural advisory service. Adoption of technologies requires
    more than mere knowledge dissemination: knowledge must be appropriately delivered
    and used by the target groups. In particular, it is very complex and difficult
    to integrate state of the art knowledge within existing curricula (Kutt 2001).
    To help the present educational situation, its structures and target groups, were
    analysed. Based on the results, teaching materials and training activities were
    developed to suit the relevant target groups and offer a more focussed approach
    and, finally, an even more successful transfer of knowledge. Also presented are
    preliminary results that indicate how knowledge about PF may lead to its adoption
    and final transfer into daily work activities. These analyses are primarily based
    on an attitude-behaviour model. Given that precision farming technologies are
    obviously “hi-tech” innovations, some further preliminary analyses will be presented
    from the perspective of a technology-acceptance model. Methods Surveys on acceptance
    and adoption of PF The acceptance and adoption of PF and its dissemination in
    Germany was analysed by surveys during agricultural exhibitions and expert interviews.
    The surveys were conducted during Agritechnica (the world’s leading exhibition
    for agricultural technology) in 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2007 and at the DLG Field
    Days (information platform for modern crop production organised by the German
    Agricultural Society) in 2006. For the exhibition interviews with farmers, a questionnaire
    with closed questions was designed and saved on handheld computers. The setup
    of the questionnaire followed the general scientific standards for oral interviews
    described by Atteslander (2006), Fink and Kosecoff (2006), Habermehl (1992), and
    Schnell et al. (2005). To get a detailed understanding of the different existing
    PF adoption patterns in Germany, farmers interviewed were divided into different
    groups according to their PF knowledge and the extent of PF technology application.
    Grouping ranged from uninformed farmers who were not familiar with the terms of
    PF, potential PF users who intended to introduce PF within the next three years
    and PF users who had a detailed knowledge of PF and already used several PF technologies.
    Farmers interviewed were asked group-specific questions (for a detailed description
    of the grouping of the interviewees and the schedule for the group-specific interviews
    see Reichardt and Jürgens (2009)). The results of all surveys were evaluated using
    the standard statistical package SPSS. The data were evaluated partly by chi-square
    test and partly by analysis of variance and the Scheffé test to identify differences
    between the interviewed groups and factors influencing adoption of PF. The significant
    difference level in all tests was 95% (p < 0.05). In addition to the exhibition
    interviews in 2007, 23 farmers already using several PF technologies were interviewed
    about their experiences with PF. The interviews were conducted with a guided questionnaire
    with open questions. This method of qualitative interviews offers the opportunity
    to get more detailed information about farmers’ experiences as well as perceived
    obstacles and problems. Sample size of the interviews means they are not representative
    and this should be considered when interpreting results. Situation analysis of
    agricultural education, advice and further education To analyse agricultural education
    and range of advisory services in 2005, questionnaires with predominantly closed
    questions were designed for each target group. The questionnaire permitted multiple
    answers. Eighty-nine teachers at technical and vocational schools from all over
    Germany were asked to what extent PF is part of agricultural education. The small
    federal states Hamburg, Berlin and Bremen were not included because they have
    no schools offering education in the agricultural sector. In addition, curricula
    content of technical and vocational schools in different federal states were analysed
    with regard to PF. Officials at the ministries of education and at departments
    of agriculture were also interviewed. At universities (including technical universities)
    with courses in agricultural sciences, 27 professors and assistant professors
    of agricultural engineering and plant production were interviewed about PF topics
    in academic education. In the area of professional training, institutions for
    further education of agricultural advisors and institutions offering joint practical
    courses were surveyed by mail. To get a general impression of PF’s presence in
    official advisory service information, telephone interviews were conducted during
    2005 with 89 state and private advisors and also with representatives of seven
    advanced training institutions of the official German agricultural advisory service.
    Development of PF knowledge transfer activities The results of the surveys provided
    the basis for the development of suitable PF knowledge transfer activities published
    or organised with partner institutions by the KTBL (Association for Technology
    and Structures in Agriculture). Popular scientific articles from agricultural
    journals, already existing teaching materials from books, special editions and
    booklets as well as a selection of private teaching materials from the respondents
    were used during 2005–2007 for the development of teaching materials, especially
    for technical and vocational schools. Experts, scientists and teachers worked
    together as authors and farmers contributed their practical experience. In 2005,
    a brochure giving an overview of PF was published (Hüter et al. 2005). In 2006,
    four PF topics were selected as being appropriate for practical application. For
    each topic, a brochure, a PowerPoint presentation and a teaching module were developed.
    In addition, special training seminars were organised and conducted in 2006–2007.
    The events were evaluated through questionnaire. Specific educational concepts
    for the different target groups were developed. Survey of users of KTBL information
    literature as basis for development of a knowledge transfer model To more thoroughly
    investigate the role of knowledge behind attitudes to PF as well as behavioural
    intentions (e.g. plans to use the technologies, readiness to recommend the technology
    to other potential users), we began a longitudinal study on various facets of
    knowledge, attitudes and experiences. More specifically, in the spring of 2007,
    we sent questionnaires to 693 users of KTBL information literature and to others
    interested in PF with questions on their utilisation of various information sources,
    their rating of the information, the content of information on PF and their application
    or intended application of PF technologies. The current analyses are based on
    the answers of 200 respondents: 96 farmers and 104 experts not having their own
    farm. This represents a response rate of 29%. The composition of respondents does
    not give a representative sample and this should be considered in the interpretation
    of results. Note that only the PF-specific KTBL information materials from Hufnagel
    et al. (2004) and Hüter et al. (2005) could be taken into consideration. In order
    to analyse the change of both usage and evaluation of information on PF technologies,
    a second wave of questionnaires was sent to the respondents at the end of 2007.
    Results of this longitudinal study will be published later. Expert workshop on
    the promotion of the research-practice dialogue on PF In an expert workshop in
    December 2007 in which 29 experts from industry, science, advisory services and
    practical farming took part, the technical obstacles hampering PF use and also
    the need for information and clarification were presented. Results Interviews
    with farmers (exhibition interviews and detailed interviews with PF users) In
    comparison to other European countries like the UK, Denmark and Sweden where experts
    estimate the adoption of PF at between 10 and 15%, the dissemination of PF in
    Germany is modest (Blackmore et al. 2006; Pedersen et al. 2004). Nevertheless,
    the results of the exhibition surveys indicate a slight progress in the awareness
    and adoption of PF in Germany. The results show an increasing number of farmers
    who are aware and informed about PF technologies. The percentage of this group
    (called the informed farmers) increased from 54% (2001) to 62% (2007) in the Agritechnica
    survey and was about 72% at the DLG Field Days (compare Table 1). In the same
    period, the percentage of PF users increased slightly from 6.65% (2001) to 9.33%
    (2007) (Agritechnica survey) and was 11% at the DLG Field Days (see Table 1).
    The differences between Agritechnica and the DLG Field Days findings result from
    the different duration and thematic focus of the two exhibitions. The DLG event
    is a small 3-day exhibition focusing on crop production. Therefore there were
    more crop producers than livestock farmers at the DLG Field Days with potentially
    greater interest in PF and therefore better knowledge of the technology (DLG Field
    Days: 78% crop producers; Agritechnica: between 55% and 66% crop producers). In
    addition to the present adoption and dissemination of PF in Germany, the results
    of the exhibition surveys as well as the results of the expert interviews indicate
    that there is a certain potential expansion of the PF users group. The percentage
    of farmers who plan to introduce PF to their farms within the next three years
    varied in the exhibition surveys between 6% and 10%. In the expert interviews,
    the majority of the farmers interviewed (15 out of 23 farmers) were of the opinion
    that the dissemination of PF in Germany would increase in the future. As a main
    reason for this optimistic appraisal, the farmers mentioned the reform of the
    EU CAP, increasing economic pressure on farmers as well as more environmental
    constraints and increased requirements for complete documentation. Due to this
    development, most of the interviewees in the expert interviews also thought that
    the demand for technologies like PF would increase in the future. Table 1 Sample
    size of the different groups of interviewed farmers, listed for the conducted
    surveys at Agritechnica (2001, 2003, 2005, 2007) and the DLG FieldDays 2006 Full
    size table Characterisation of the different interview groups The general trend
    of other studies indicating that farmers with larger farms are the first to adopt
    PF technologies (Pedersen et al. 2004; Daberkow and McBride 2003) could also be
    proved for Germany. The results of the exhibition surveys show significant differences
    between the farm size of the PF users and the other groups (Reichardt and Jürgens
    2009). The median farm size of the PF users in the exhibition surveys varied between
    380 ha (2001), 250 ha (2003), 345 ha (2005) 355 ha (2006) and 320 ha (2007). The
    median farm size of the interviewees in the expert interviews was, at 1500 ha,
    considerably larger. In comparison to this, overall average farm size in Germany
    is 43.1 ha (D_STATIS 2006). Most of the interviewed PF users group members (in
    the exhibition surveys as well as in the expert interviews) were located in the
    eastern part of Germany where the average farm and field size is larger than in
    the western part of the country. The structural difference between east and west
    Germany is a result of the creation of agricultural production co-operatives (LPG)
    on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic. Today this structure
    is the basis for a relative high adoption rate of PF technologies in eastern Germany
    compared to other regions. The potential PF users group members manage smaller
    farms with a median size between 100 and 200 ha. The farm sizes of the informed
    non-PF users and of the uninformed farmers are very small in comparison to the
    other groups. They manage farms with a median size less than 100 ha (Reichardt
    and Jürgens 2009). Daberkow and McBride (2003) came to the conclusion that the
    farmer’s education plays an important role in adoption of new technologies. The
    results of the exhibition interviews led to a similar conclusion; all survey results
    show significant differences in education level between the groups of interviewed
    farmers (using chi-square test). The group of PF users had a high percentage of
    farmers with a university degree (49.5% (2001), 41.2% (2003), 40.6% (2005), 54.2%
    (2006) and 33.34% (2007)). In comparison, there were fewer farmers with a university
    degree in the group of potential PF users (37.3% (2001), 26.9% (2003), 26.5% (2005),
    40.4% (2006), 20.7% (2007)) and the group of informed non-pf users (28.2% (2001),
    23.2% (2003), 23.1% (2005), 31.3% (2006), 18.2% (2007)). Among the uninformed
    farmers, there were only a few with a university degree; the percentage varied
    between 7.3% (2001), 6.7% (2003), 7.0% (2005), 7.7% (2006) and 5.8% (2007). Adoption
    patterns for PF in Germany and existing problems The results of the exhibition
    interviews (compare Reichardt and Jürgens 2009) as well as the results of the
    expert interviews (compare Fig. 1) show differences in the adoption of the various
    PF techniques with the majority of the interviewed farmers still using data collection
    practices rather than variable rate application techniques. This confirms the
    results of other surveys in Denmark, UK and USA where yield mapping was the most
    common practice followed by soil sampling. Both of these technologies collect
    data from the fields. PF methods that help take account of previously gained information
    are the third and fourth most used practices (Pedersen et al. 2001). Only a small,
    but since 2001 increasing number of PF users (exhibition interviews), already
    used variable rate application techniques. Variable basic fertilising and site-specific
    N fertilising (not sensor based) were used in particular. The expert interviews
    gave similar results: based on previously gained information, most of the interviewed
    experts practiced as a first step variable basic fertilising and, as a second
    step, most of them used the sensor based variable application of N fertiliser
    (Yara N-Sensor and Crop-Meter). Fig. 1 PF-methods used by farmers taking part
    in expert interviews Full size image One reason for the low adoption rate of variable
    rate application techniques is implemented in the PF system approach itself that
    requires a certain database for decision making. Most of the farmers in the expert
    interviews (18 out of 23) stated that they first collected the data on average
    for 3 up to 6 years, then analysed the data and subsequently started with variable
    rate application techniques. The results of the exhibition surveys showed that
    most of the interviewed PF users started to introduce first PF techniques from
    1999 onwards. There were only a few farmers who had already started before 1999
    (compare Fig. 2). This means that the implementation of variable rate application
    techniques based on previously gathered information was postponed by several years.
    Fig. 2 Introcuction dates of the different techniques. The results presented are
    for the complete sample period (2001–2007) Full size image A further reason why
    most of the farmers used data collection techniques only could be that they had
    problems with data handling and their correct interpretation. Surveys in Denmark
    and the USA (Sørensen et al. 2002; Fountas et al. 2005) found that farmers had
    difficulties using collected data efficiently and making management decisions
    based on them. Probably the German farmers have similar problems because, in the
    surveys between 2003 and 2007, most of the farmers did the analysis of the data
    on their own (2003: 50%, 2005: 60%; 2006: 59% and 2007: 54%). The results of the
    expert interviews show that especially the analysis and interpretation of yield
    maps caused many problems. The maps varied from year to year so the farmers had
    difficulties in identifying different management zones. Other farmers stated that
    they had problems in making the right farming decision for the different management
    zones. To improve this situation, it is necessary to offer a good advisory and
    information service. The main problem in the use of PF techniques mentioned by
    the farmers in the exhibition surveys (Reichardt and Jürgens 2009) as well as
    by the farmers in the expert interviews (23 out of 23 interviewed farmers) was
    the large amount of time spent getting used to the technology. The results of
    the expert interviews showed that, on larger farms, one employee was often responsible
    for the PF technology and that this helped in its successful application. Smaller
    farms did not have enough manpower nor the necessary time to concentrate on PF
    compared with bigger farms. Especially for smaller farms, an advisory service
    would be helpful to reduce time requirements in the initial stage. A further problem
    mentioned by the farmers in the exhibition surveys (on the average of all surveys
    22.4%) and by half of the farmers in the expert interviews (12 out of 23) was
    the lack of compatibility between machinery from different manufacturers as well
    as between hardware and software. The results of the expert interviews showed
    that those farmers who overcame this problem often bought compatible machinery
    so that the problem did not occur again. Others used special interfaces to enable
    communication between different machinery. Those farmers who tried to ensure good
    communication between machinery through the use of ISOBUS systems were often not
    successful. Eight of all interviewed experts tried to achieve communication between
    the machines by ISOBUS; six of them stated that it did not work properly. Only
    two farmers achieved compatibility through ISOBUS. As a result of these experiences,
    many experts avoided the introduction of further techniques and wanted to wait
    until the technology works properly. Expert statements concerning the handling
    of the software and the machinery ranged from “easy” to “complicated”. The handling
    mainly depended on information service input and training courses offered. Those
    farmers, who received good service often judged the handling of the technology
    “easy”, while farmers without service judged the use of the technology “complicated”.
    This demonstrates the importance of a good information service and training. A
    further problem especially mentioned by owners of bigger farms in eastern Germany
    was the recruitment of qualified and experienced workers able to handle the technology.
    The experts mentioned that the training of young farmers was insufficient meaning
    that they were not able to work properly with this technology. This indicates
    that PF education of young farmers at the various institutions has to be improved.
    Pre-requisites of a future perspective of PF in Germany Although the farmers complained
    about several problems during the introduction of PF, after overcoming these initial
    problems most of the farmers were satisfied with the introduction of PF and the
    majority of the interviewed PF users (in all surveys over 45% of the interviewed
    PF users––and as high as 75% in the 2007 survey) found a financial benefit through
    PF. In order to improve this situation and to reduce the time spent and frustration
    in the beginning, it is necessary to offer better information services from the
    PF industry itself as well as from the advisory service. Results of detailed expert
    interviews with PF users confirmed this statement. The farmers who were content
    with PF in general had a good personal information service from the PF industries
    and often had attended special training courses conducted by the companies to
    get used to the technology. Although the results of the exhibition surveys indicate
    a continuously increasing number of German farmers introducing PF to their farms
    since 2001, the majority of farmers interviewed still do not use any PF technology
    and did not plan to introduce it in the near future. According to the statements
    of the interviewed farmers in the exhibition surveys (Reichardt and Jürgens 2009)
    and expert interviews, the main reason for the low adoption rate of PF in Germany
    was the high cost of the technology. Concerning the statements of the experts,
    the high cost means that the use of the technology is only profitable for large
    farms with high machinery operating times. With the exception of eastern Germany,
    most farms in Germany remain very small at about 43.1 ha (D_STATIS 2006), with
    small field sizes. So the main prerequisite for further adoption of PF in Germany
    is reduction of costs for the technology. A further pre-requisite mentioned by
    many farmers in the exhibition interviews is the implementation of reliable uniform
    standards that enable communication between hardware and software. Analysis of
    agricultural advice, education and further education Survey of local advisors
    The different exhibition surveys as well as the detailed expert interviews indicated
    the key role of a good advisory service for the adoption of PF. Other studies
    in Denmark came to similar conclusions (Pedersen et al. 2004). This shows that
    farmers need more information about the different PF tools and more training opportunities
    as well as a better advisory service. In order to get a general impression of
    what kind of PF information services the local advisory service in Germany offers,
    89 private and official advisors from all over Germany were interviewed. Most
    of the advisors (58.4%) did not offer any advisory service for PF. The survey
    of representatives from the further education institutes for agricultural advisors
    yielded a similar picture. In addition, most advisors seemed to have no great
    interest in this topic given that they had only limited knowledge of PF and that
    they stated that PF is of no interest for farmers. So 41.6% of the advisors rated
    the need of the advisory service in this field as “low”. According to the advisors
    (75.3%), most farmers were not interested in PF. The advisors’ attitudes towards
    PF were reflected in the statements of some farmers in the expert interviews who
    complained about the passive role of the official advisory service in PF. Some
    experts even mentioned that advisors often hindered dissemination of new technologies
    (Reichardt and Jürgens 2007). In order to improve this situation, it is important
    to inform advisors about the prospects of PF and to offer suitable advisory concepts
    for PF and special training courses for advisors to inform them about PF. Provision
    for PF in education at technical and vocational schools for agriculture To get
    a general impression the extent to which PF topics are part of agricultural education
    at vocational and technical schools, 89 teachers were interviewed in 2005. The
    majority (57%) of the teachers stated that PF was not a subject within their courses.
    At schools where PF was included, only basic information was provided mostly in
    terms of single oral presentations or single lessons. Nevertheless, most of the
    teachers declared PF an important topic for the education of young farmers. However,
    they remarked that PF is an ambitious topic that requires students to have a basic
    knowledge level. So this topic is more suitable for technical schools because
    the basic knowledge already exists there. At most of the schools (89%), PF was
    not a subject of tests or final exams. The survey indicated that especially in
    the eastern part of Germany where the use of PF technology is more popular due
    to the larger average farm size, PF was more often a subject for young farmers
    than in other parts of Germany (Reichardt and Jürgens 2007). Integration of PF
    into curricula An analysis conducted in 2005 in different federal states of Germany
    showed that the topic PF was not integrated into any curricula in vocational schools.
    In technical schools, only three federal states prescribe the topic of PF as part
    of the educational programme with 15 to 30 hours devoted to it. The attitudes
    towards the integration of PF topics into lessons or curricula varied widely.
    Some of the respondents refused the introduction of PF because this topic was
    too complicated for the teaching level, especially at vocational schools, or because
    the curricula were filled up with other more important topics so that there was
    not enough time to integrate PF. Other teachers declared the integration of PF
    to be necessary for the future education of young farmers and that it should be
    integrated into the areas of plant production, agricultural techniques, process
    control or data processing. Especially in the eastern part of Germany, the teachers
    were interested in integrating PF into their courses. In fact, teachers struggled
    with various difficulties such as lack of teaching material and most of the interviewed
    teachers had no knowledge of PF because their own education was many years in
    the past. Thus further training for teachers would make sense. Teaching material
    and training courses especially for teachers Most of the interviewees (86.6%)
    were interested in adequate educational concepts and teaching materials. The material
    should be adapted to the education level of vocational and technical schools,
    be simple and not too extensive. It should be provided in a digital as well as
    in analogue form. In particular, there was great demand for slides with illustrations
    of PF or for PowerPoint presentations of the different fields of application.
    Furthermore, most of the teachers were interested in special training courses
    covering PF. Consideration of PF in education at universities and technical universities
    At all universities with agricultural study courses, PF topics were represented.
    In most cases in 2005, PF was part of the lectures in agricultural engineering,
    agricultural economics, agricultural information science, soil science, plant
    protection, plant nutrition or remote sensing. Moreover, seven out of ten universities
    offered special modules for PF. The most courses in PF were offered by the University
    of Hohenheim with five modules in PF and additionally one in precision livestock
    farming. At the universities of Kiel, Berlin, Bonn, Hohenheim and Freising, PF
    was taught as an interdisciplinary subject. At all ten surveyed agricultural technical
    universities in Germany, PF was also part of the courses in 2005, but to a smaller
    extent than at universities. The teaching units ranged from half an hour (Bingen)
    up to eight hours per week (Osnabrück, four in the bachelor courses and four in
    the master courses). Predominantly, PF was part of the courses in agricultural
    engineering and process management and attached to the theme of electronics and
    control measurement techniques. PF was partially tutored in combination with crop
    production. According to survey results, PF was taught at technical universities
    in a less differentiated and seldom interdisciplinary way. Only three technical
    universities (Neubrandenburg, Osnabrück and Nürtingen) offered special modules
    for PF with interdisciplinary co-operation. The professors interviewed in the
    survey stated that between 300 and 380 students at universities and between 300
    and 340 students at technical universities studied PF every year. In general,
    students had no, or little, knowledge about PF, with the exception of those who
    had already obtained practical experience on their farms. Slides, PowerPoint presentations
    and teaching materials created by the lecturers themselves were predominantly
    used in academic education. With the exception of one, all professors declared
    PF an important topic with increasing importance for academic agricultural education.
    Regarding the future for PF, 60% of respondents stated that requirement for documentation
    will lead to increasing spread of PF technologies. This meant the necessity of
    developing functioning automatic data collecting systems to simplify field documentation.
    Furthermore, the possibility of optimised nutrient management and optimised fertilising
    through PF, as well as the use of tracking systems, would promote the spread of
    PF. Some of the respondents saw PF more critically. They remarked that the importance
    of PF was overestimated because it was just one part of available farming techniques.
    According to them, the most practicable tools of PF were online applications.
    In general, the respondents remarked that the technique must be cheaper, user-friendlier
    and more reliable in order to be adopted by an increasing number of farmers in
    future. Coverage of PF at education institutions for further training In 2005,
    17 representatives of further education and shared practical experience courses
    from all over Germany were asked whether they offer special courses in PF. Only
    two institutions in Saxony, one institution in Schleswig-Holstein and three from
    four institutions in Bavaria offered PF courses. In addition, seven representatives
    of institutions for further education of agricultural advisors were interviewed.
    These institutions offered PF instruction for advisors conducted in the form of
    one or two-day meetings, seminars or single presentations. During the last year,
    about 300 advisors had attended the various PF events although participation was
    not obligatory. These institutions were very interested in teaching materials,
    especially slides and illustrations for their lectures. We did not find any activities
    similar to the magazine for farmers “Precision AG News” nor its newsletter published
    by the Southern Precision Agricultural Association in Australia nor its experience
    exchange activities (www.spaa.com.au). The development and testing of teaching
    materials Analysis of PF training showed that PF was already, and mainly, a subject
    in courses at higher educational levels in universities and technical universities
    and that there was sufficient lecture material. However, in the lower educational
    levels at technical and vocational school as well as at institutions for further
    education and shared practical courses, PF training was under-represented. The
    representatives from these institutions remarked on a lack of suitable teaching
    material. Available written information A booklet was developed (Hüter et al.
    2005) explaining PF application and techniques with simple and well-structured
    illustrations. The booklet was especially developed for farmers and students attending
    vocational and technical schools who had no, or very little, PF knowledge. It
    is based on Hufnagel et al. (2004) and Aschenbrenner et al. (2003) including information
    and illustrations from several companies. Adding to the general presentation of
    precision farming in the first booklet are four brochures produced in 2007 presenting
    different topics in more detail (see Table 2). Special teaching material with
    PowerPoint presentation and learning modules for vocational and technical schools
    was developed and tested at various schools and revised accordingly. Table 2 Teaching
    materials Full size table In addition, special learning modules for agricultural
    education, including PowerPoint presentations, were developed in co-operation
    with some teachers from vocational schools. The modules explain how the topic
    of PF can be integrated into lectures and what method of teaching can be applied.
    They correspond closely to the brochures and can be used for class, as well as
    for general, presentations. At the end of every chapter, there are exercise sheets
    for the pupils and test questions for learning control. The materials were tested
    and evaluated at various vocational and technical schools. The results of the
    evaluation were used for revisions. The teaching materials were developed especially
    for the educational level at vocational and technical schools with straightforward
    explanations and illustrations. Seminars and training courses for different target
    groups In order to communicate PF and its possibilities to different agricultural
    target groups, KTBL conducted, in co-operation with partner institutions, 16 seminars
    and training courses (see Table 3). These seminars were usually one-day events
    and were organised in almost all federal states of Germany. Partners were schools
    and agrarian administrative boards, chambers of agriculture, manufacturers and
    suppliers. Two seminars for farmers had to be cancelled through lack of interest.
    Table 3 Seminars and training courses on precision farming Full size table Three
    special training courses for teachers were held in co-operation with teacher training
    institutes (Hüter and Klöble 2007b). 134 teachers from 11 federal states participated.
    Two of these courses were conducted with the co-operation of manufacturers Amazone
    in Leipzig and Claas in Harsewinkel. The target groups of the other 13 events
    were farmers, their employees and agricultural contractors. Altogether, 489 participants
    attended these events. Most of them assessed their own knowledge about PF as small.
    There was great interest in GPS tracking systems among the participating farmers.
    The seminars were consistently evaluated positively, especially regarding technical
    content and presentations. Almost all participants stated that they had gained
    substantial information and that they would recommend such a seminar to their
    colleagues. Users of KTBL information literature As a basis for development of
    a knowledge transfer model, an additional survey was started in spring 2007. Questionnaires
    were sent to 693 recipients of general KTBL information publications. 96 farmers
    and 104 agriculture experts without their own farms responded from all over Germany.
    Farmer users of KTBL information literature The farmers averaged 40.5 years of
    age with 17.9 years of professional experience. Table 4 presents a selection of
    the results, i.e. the means and standard deviations of the core variables as well
    as the Pearson correlations. Remember that this is not a representative sample
    of German farmers so that descriptive data are less important than results on
    the relationships between the variables. Table 4 Descriptive statistics and correlations
    between study variables (farmers) Full size table In such a group that probably
    tends towards being more informed than average, the acceptance of PF was in total
    very high. Additionally, one-third of group members already had experience with
    PF. In fact 16% had already applied PF on their own farms, primarily in data collection
    techniques as mentioned above. Another 19% had tried PF. 52% of this sample of
    farmers intended to use PF on their farms. Those comprising this 52% tended to
    run larger farms than those not wishing to use PF. They assessed PF up to 87.8%
    as positive, up to 79.6% as useful but also up to 53% as too expensive, replicating
    results presented above. They estimated that PF enables more precise working,
    saves inputs and supports documentation requirements. The potential PF user did
    not differ in age or professional experience from farmers not wishing to apply
    PF. Contrary to the results already presented from interviews at agricultural
    exhibitions (Table 1), almost 100% of the farmers were well informed on PF technology
    in general as well as individual methods and procedures. The information-seeking
    behaviour of the farmers regarding PF did not differ from their general information-seeking
    behaviour. Specialist magazines, exhibitions, further education institutes and
    discussions with professional colleagues were used most often as information sources.
    These sources were assessed as qualitatively good. Very seldom was information
    about PF available during conventional education and this supports the results
    presented above. The PF user gains information more through company brochures,
    Internet and at dealerships compared with farmers not using PF, although such
    sources are generally estimated as of less quality. The KTBL information literature
    such as the already mentioned booklet “Elektronik, Satelliten und Co” (Hüter et
    al. 2005) and the loose-leaf collection “Precision Farming” (Hufnagel et al. 2004)
    were only used by 10%–although the quality of such information was assessed very
    positively by respondents. The main point of the surveys was to find what influenced
    intention to use PF and the role played in this aspect by the available information.
    According to the Technology Acceptance Model (Venkatesh and Davis 2000), high
    acceptance of the respective technology is an important predictor of future usage
    of the innovation. In addition, both perceived usefulness and perceived usability
    play an important role. In fact, we found that both variables predict acceptance.
    Consistent with other research (Venkatesh and Davis 2000), perceived usefulness
    is more important than perceived usability. Exploratory analyses found that previous
    experiences are also a good predictor of perceived usefulness. Moreover, the perceived
    economic weaknesses are negatively correlated with perceived usefulness. “Economic
    weaknesses” means economic unsuitabilty, too high cost and also the opinion that
    PF is only efficient for large farms. According to the theory of planned behaviour
    (Ajzen 1991), we should consider three main predictors, attitude towards the behaviour,
    subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. As Table 4 shows, these aspects
    play an important role in this context. For example, subjective norms are a powerful
    predictor of intention to use. In other words, the opinion of significant “other
    people” is important in the decision to adopt or not to adopt PF. We found that
    the economic unsuitability for their own farm, the high financial risk and the
    excessive purchase price have a significant negative influence on the intention
    to use. This means that the reasons preventing the application of PF up until
    now have been mainly economic ones. This was also found in the interviews at the
    exhibitions. As mentioned, at least up to the beginning of 2007 the information
    material available from the KTBL was used comparatively seldom although those
    who did utilise the material assessed it as of very high quality. In order to
    gain a first impression of how this usage behaviour can be more precisely explained,
    or which importance the information sources could have, we analysed whether it
    was possible to identify differences between users and non-users. An important
    difference identified was that users of the KTBL material were also very likely
    to be trend-setters (Batinic et al. 2006). The term trend-setter is applied to
    indicate people that are interested in innovations independently of generally
    accepted trends and who actively popularise the innovations further. So long as
    PF expands only very slowly, it is all the more important to reach and to convince
    trend-setters. The KTBL information materials about PF seem to reach the appropriate
    target group. Also noticeable, however, is that the users of the KTBL information,
    contrary to other respondents, were not particularly positive about PF. In fact
    they tended to be of the opinion that the technology was not yet technically good
    enough. This could, however, also be evaluated as an indication of an objective
    presentation of the information. Experts without their own farms who use KTBL
    information literature 104 agriculture experts, who are not themselves farming,
    participated in this survey. Their opinions and activities regarding PF are relevant
    because, e.g., as teachers or advisors they are important multipliers in the knowledge
    transfer process. The experts had the following main occupations (multiple answers
    were permitted): consulting/advising 33, teaching 30, training 9, research and
    development 25, sales and marketing 14, machinery/technology services 4 and “others”
    18. Experts without their own farm were also well-informed about PF. And here
    too, they knew most about methods and processes such as GPS-based area measurement,
    GPS-based yield mapping and GPS-based parallel tracking. Of those experts, 71%
    had already informed or advised about PF. For 34.7% of them, PF was already an
    established part of the information they imparted. And 81% planned to feature
    PF in the information that they impart. Similar to the results in previous sections,
    these experts planned to inform more about data collection techniques than over
    variable rate application (e.g. fertiliser application) techniques. Contrary to
    the responses from farmers, only a weak relationship could be established between
    acceptance of PF and behavioural intentions such as the intention to inform over
    PF. The intention to inform over PF was influenced above all by perceived pressure
    including the reaction of competitors or colleagues and the opinions of important
    people in the respondents’ social environment (“subjective norms”; see Table 5).
    Table 5 Descriptive statistics and correlations of study variables (experts without
    own farms) Full size table The experts eager to recommend PF differ from the others
    in that they are often already informing over PF and are more likely to accept
    and positively assess it. They also assess the proportion of farmers already applying
    PF as higher and agree with more conviction that it makes sense to adapt to technological
    progress and that those modern technologies in farming are becoming increasingly
    important. Finally, they tend to be trend-setters. As with the farmers, the information-seeking
    behaviour of the experts involved primarily specialist magazines, exhibitions,
    further education facilities and discussions with professional colleagues as preferred
    sources, and these were also assessed as of good quality. Contrary to the farmers
    however, the Internet was more often used (67%; farmers: 40%). The experts used
    the KTBL information material on PF substantially more than the farmers, with
    the publications from Hufnagel et al. (2004) and from Hüter et al. (2005) known
    to 30% and 39.8% of the respondents respectively. And the experts agreed with
    the farmers in their high estimation of the quality of this information. Finally,
    it was found that those experts using the KTBL information material on PF know
    in total more about the technique, accept it more readily and also already show
    more intensive advisory or teaching activities. Expert workshops on PF practical
    application and research dialogue In a two-day workshop at the end of 2007, the
    following themes were looked into more closely by small groups on the basis of
    expert presentations: identifying and documenting differences in location and
    soil; possibilities of aerial and satellite photographs; recording of yield and
    quality; level of mechanisation for PF; basic conditions and infrastructure for
    PF; estimation of yield potential and calculation of processes, data and information
    management on farms; training for PF; PF demonstration farms; infrastructure for
    PF and customer advantages with PF. As before, the large problems in compatibility
    between individual implements and also between products from different manufacturers
    were very clearly revealed in the discussions. Even though there are standardised
    interfaces such as ISOBUS between instruments and the farm PC, these have to be
    more strongly implemented by the companies involved. Company representatives agreed
    that they would work towards this. The distrust shown by practical farmers needs
    to be replaced with a new trust. Standardisation in the area of data transfer
    could be extended through agroXML (Schmitz et al. 2007). The following activities
    were encouraged: Installation of a demonstration farm network Initiative for implementing
    the theme PF within agricultural education curricula Creation of co-ordination
    points for calibrations and remote sensing data Creation of a platform for PF
    information and experience exchange Conclusions The exhibition interviews of 2001–2007
    show that only a small proportion of German farmers has so far applied PF methods.
    Since 2001, this proportion has slowly but steadily increased. A similar situation
    applies to the proportion of farmers who plan to start with PF. From this, it
    can be concluded that PF is certainly a useful technique for agriculture in Germany.
    Although the proportion of farmers, especially younger ones, who are not informed
    about PF is very large (40–50%), it can be concluded that many farmers do not
    use PF because they do not know about it, even although it could be useful for
    them. The most widely disseminated forms of PF are data collection techniques
    such as GPS-based area measurement and GPS-based yield mapping. Less widely used
    are variable rate application techniques such as site-specific N fertilising.
    The reason for this could be that farmers require considerable time in order to
    feel that they have been supplied with enough information to master more than
    simply information collection. Another important reason why most farmers used
    only data collection techniques could be that they had problems with data handling
    and with interpreting the data correctly. The Agritechnica surveys indicated that
    there were substantial educational deficits regarding PF. Even though PF is already
    an established part of the curricula of technical and other universities, it is
    a subject merely touched upon at vocational and technical schools as well as at
    institutions for further education and shared practical experience courses. As
    the respondents remarked, the main problem faced within the teaching of PF is
    a lack of suitable teaching materials. Hence, one aim was to develop PF teaching
    materials tailor-made to suit the requirements of the respective teaching level.
    Furthermore, many teachers, lecturers and advisors have not undergone PF training
    themselves. The brochures containing information on different PF topics for farmers
    and students of vocational and technical schools were positively accepted by the
    users. More than 500 participants including around 150 agriculture teachers attended
    seminars for farmers and experts from 2005 to 2007 dealing with various aspects
    of PF. The evaluation of these events was consistently positive, almost all participants
    stated that they had gained substantial information and would recommend such seminars
    to their colleagues. Investigations into information-seeking behaviour with regard
    to PF acceptance indicate that inter-regional specialised magazines, exhibitions,
    discussions with professional colleagues and further education arrangements are
    most utilised to gain information about PF and are considered as the best sources.
    For this reason, the conducted activities in the knowledge transfer process, development
    of information and teaching material and further education facilities were assessed
    as useful. In the further planning of PF knowledge transfer, all these sources
    have therefore to be considered because, through these, the most information about
    PF is disseminated. Especially the further education facilities should foster
    opportunities for experience exchanges between professional colleagues and for
    practical experience with PF technology. There seems to be a clearly greater demand
    for information on PF variable rate application techniques compared with that
    for the data collection ones. As long as PF is only slowly disseminated, it is
    important that above all, trend-setters be reached and convinced because they
    are more interested in new introductions and tend to be more ready to recommend
    these innovations to others and, on top of this, have a tendency of being independent
    from the opinions of others and of popular average opinion. In that a clear relationship
    has been established between PF image and its perceived usefulness, more work
    should be done in the future to improve the PF image, e.g. through information
    on its financial advantages. A target for further communication should also be
    to show how PF could be usefully applied on smaller farms too, for instance via
    the technique being used by agricultural contractors or in joint farm operations.
    The key to successfully implementing PF lies not only in improving the education
    provided to farmers and establishing a functioning information and advisory service
    in this respect but also in improving compatibility through standardised software
    and machinery. References Ajzen, I. (1991). The theory of planned behaviour. Organizational

    INTRODUCTION\nThe need to reduce nutrient loads from anthropogenic\nsources to\
    \ avoid harmful impacts on groundwater and\nsurface water resources, including\
    \ eutrophication and\nhypoxia in aquatic ecosystems, has been widely recognised\n\
    (Diaz and Rosenberg 2008). The Baltic Sea is among the\nmost heavily degraded\
    \ marine ecosystems worldwide, due\nin part to excessive nutrient loads (Reusch\
    \ et al. 2018). Of\nthe total nutrient loads from land reaching the Baltic Sea,\n\
    over half of the nitrogen (N) and one-third of phosphorous\n(P) come from agriculture\
    \ (Arheimer et al. 2012). This has\nled to adoption of the Baltic Sea Action Plan\
    \ with heavy\nreduction targets for N (13%) and P (41%) (HELCOM\n2007, 2013).\
    \ Although the Baltic Sea Action Plan has been\npartially successful in reducing\
    \ nutrient loads to the Baltic\nSea, severe problems still remain (Elmgren et\
    \ al. 2015;\nReusch et al. 2018).\nSome of the nutrients leaching from the root\
    \ zone do not\nreach the marine environment due to a variety of biogeo-\nchemical\
    \ processes, sorption and sedimentation (Wulff et al.\n2014; Højberg et al. 2015).\
    \ These processes are often\ndenoted ‘retention’ (Wulff et al. 2014). We will\
    \ in this paper\nspeciﬁcally deal with nitrogen and use the term N-reduction,\n\
    as nitrogen is subject to biogeochemical reduction when\ntransported in anoxic\
    \ environments, where degradable\norganic matter, pyrite or other reductants are\
    \ present.\nMany measures have been proposed and applied to\nreduce nutrient loads\
    \ from agriculture through actions on\nland (Dalgaard et al. 2014; Wulff et al.\
    \ 2014) as well as to\nremove nutrients by restoration actions in streams (Wortley\n\
    et al. 2013). The existing action plans typically use mea-\nsures uniformly across\
    \ entire countries without considering\nlocal variations in N-reduction capacity\
    \ in soils, ground-\nwater and surface water systems. As N-reduction varies\n\
    signiﬁcantly at small scales depending on the hydrogeo-\nlogical and riverine\
    \ conditions (Hansen et al. 2014b; Høj-\nberg et al. 2015), a spatially differentiated\
    \ approach with\nmeasures targeted towards areas where the natural N-re-\nduction\
    \ is low, will be more cost-effective than the tradi-\ntional uniform measures\
    \ (Jacobsen and Hansen 2016). The\npotential for such new, spatially differentiated\
    \ approaches\naccounting for local data and knowledge has not yet been\ntested\
    \ (Hashemi et al. 2016).\n123\n\x02 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2019\nwww.kva.se/en\n\
    Ambio 2019, 48:1278–1289\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-019-01195-w\nEvaluating\
    \ the impacts of ﬁeld level spatially differen-\ntiated measures at the 1.8 million\
    \ km2 Baltic Sea drainage\nbasin poses a particular challenge. The model setups\
    \ typ-\nically used at this scale (Donnelly et al. 2013) are not able\nto simulate\
    \ small-scale spatially differentiated measures,\nbecause (i) the models operate\
    \ at a much coarser spatial\nresolution than the measures; (ii) they often do\
    \ not include\nsmall-scale data but instead use aggregated data which can\nvary\
    \ in quality and resolution between countries and (iii)\nthey often have simpliﬁed\
    \ process descriptions adequate\nfor the input data complexity but inadequate\
    \ to simulate\nspeciﬁc measures, e.g. for N-reduction in rivers, wetlands\nand\
    \ groundwater. Such measures can be simulated by\ncomprehensive and data-demanding\
    \ small-scale models\n(Hansen et al. 2017). However, for computational and data\n\
    access reasons, these models are not operational at the\ngreater Baltic Sea drainage\
    \ basin scale. Therefore, a\nmethod must be applied for upscaling the results\
    \ from\nsuitable small-scale models to models operating at the\nBaltic Sea scale.\
    \ Bronstert et al. (2007) provide one of the\nvery few examples reported in literature\
    \ of such upscaling\nbased on dynamic combinations of small- and large-scale\n\
    models.\nDesign of scheme with spatially differentiated measures\nrequires estimates\
    \ of water ﬂows and nutrient ﬂuxes at the\nspatial scale for which it is intended\
    \ to be applied.\nHydrological models providing such estimates are known\nto have\
    \ increasing prediction uncertainty the smaller the\narea is considered (Hansen\
    \ et al. 2014b; Refsgaard et al.\n2016). Another challenge is therefore that while\
    \ spatially\ndifferentiated measures will be most efﬁcient when applied\nat local\
    \ scale, they are at the same time faced with the\nlargest uncertainties at local\
    \ scale. Furthermore, spatial\ndifferentiation will affect stakeholders differently.\
    \ Hence,\nuse of spatial differentiation in a regulatory context may\npose new\
    \ governance challenges.\nIn this paper, we conﬁne our analyses to N and outline\
    \ a\nwidely applicable concept for spatial differentiation. The\nobjectives of\
    \ our paper are (i) to quantify the potential\nbeneﬁts of spatially differentiated\
    \ measures; (ii) to identify\nthe key scientiﬁc challenges related to implementing\
    \ the\nconcept in practice; and (iii) to assess the policy challenges\nrelated\
    \ to a governance regime based on a spatially dif-\nferentiated regulation.\n\
    MATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy area\nThe Baltic Sea drainage basin covers a land\
    \ area of around\n1.8 Mio. km2 in Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithua-\n\
    nia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and\nSweden, as well as small areas\
    \ in Ukraine, Slovakia and the\nCzech Republic. The landscapes within the basin\
    \ are\nheavily inﬂuenced by their glacial or periglacial history.\nGeologically,\
    \ the northern parts of the basin belong to the\nFennoscandian shield, consisting\
    \ of silicate bedrock with\nlow geochemical reactivity, low permeability and thin\n\
    soils. Lakes cover large fractions of the land surface here.\nThe southern parts\
    \ are geologically more diverse, and non-\nconsolidated\nQuaternary\nsediments\n\
    occur\nextensively,\nproviding for comprehensive groundwater resources in\ngeochemically\
    \ reactive aquifer materials. Owing to the\ncold climate and less-developed soils,\
    \ land cover in the\nnorthern parts is dominated by boreal forests, while agri-\n\
    culture is prevalent on suitable land in the southern parts of\nthe basin (Fig.\
    \ 1).\nTo improve knowledge of N-reduction processes in\nsurface water and groundwater,\
    \ we conducted combined\nﬁeld and modelling studies in four small catchments:\n\
    Norsminde\n(Denmark),\nTullstorp\n(Sweden),\nKocinka\n(Poland) and Pregolya (Russia/Poland),\
    \ representing dif-\nferent climatic, geological and socioeconomic conditions\n\
    (Fig. 1, Table 1). In addition, some of the modelling studies\nin Denmark used\
    \ an existing model from the 486 km2\nOdense catchment located in Funen in the\
    \ middle of\nDenmark (Karlsson et al. 2016).\nThe concept of spatial differentiation\n\
    Excess nitrate, that has not been taken up by plants, may be\nleached from the\
    \ root zone (N-leaching) and transported\neither via overland ﬂow or near-surface\
    \ ﬂow paths,\nincluding drain pipes, directly to surface waters or ﬂows\ndeeper\
    \ into the groundwater system. In the upper, oxic part\nof the groundwater zone,\
    \ nitrate will act as a conservative\ntracer, while, when transported into the\
    \ anoxic zone, it will\nbe biogeochemically reduced to N2. The extent of nitrate\n\
    reduction occurring in groundwater depends on the ﬂow\npaths and the depths of\
    \ the redox interface separating the\noxic and anoxic zones (Postma et al. 1991;\
    \ Hansen et al.\n2014a). After leaving the groundwater zone, nitrate is\nsubject\
    \ to biogeochemical reduction in the hyporheic zone\nalong the river and in sediments\
    \ of lakes and rivers (Boano\net al. 2014).\nDue to heterogeneities in geology\
    \ and river morphology\nand due to anthropogenic drainage systems, the extent\
    \ of\nN-reduction in groundwater and surface water can exhibit\nsubstantial local\
    \ spatial variations. Figure 2 shows the\ncalculated N-reduction between the root\
    \ zone and the\nmarine recipient for a farm in the Norsminde catchment.\nThis\
    \ reveals very large variations in the natural N-reduc-\ntion, which can be exploited\
    \ to spatially target mitigation\nactions. The concept of spatial differentiation\
    \ is to use\nknowledge of how natural N-removal differs in each area\n\x02 Royal\
    \ Swedish Academy of Sciences 2019\nwww.kva.se/en\n123\nAmbio 2019, 48:1278–1289\n\
    1279\n(Fig. 2) to manage N-loads. It would, for example, be\nwasted effort, and\
    \ potentially impose an unnecessary cost\nburden, to restrict agricultural N management\
    \ on ﬁelds\nwhere the natural N-reduction already removes more than\n90% of the\
    \ N-leaching from the root zone. Conversely, it\nwill be much more efﬁcient to\
    \ locate the mitigation mea-\nsures on ﬁelds with N-reductions which are considerably\n\
    lower, in the order of 30%.\nSpatial differentiation can be implemented in different\n\
    ways. One option is to relocate existing agricultural prac-\ntices according to\
    \ the N-reduction capacity, so that crops/\npractices with high N-leaching are\
    \ moved to areas with\nhigh N-reduction and vice versa. Another option is to apply\n\
    agricultural mitigation measures such as changing crop\nrotation and applying\
    \ cover crops on target areas with low\nnatural N-reduction. A third option is\
    \ to perform engi-\nneered restoration actions that enhance nitrogen removal\n\
    capacity, e.g. constructed wetlands, drain ﬁlter solutions,\nre-meandering of\
    \ streams, sediment traps or ﬂooding areas\nalongside the main stream channel.\n\
    It is important to note that spatial differentiation is not a\nmeasure in itself\
    \ parallel to existing measures such as\nnorms for fertiliser application, cover\
    \ crops, engineering\nrestoration. Instead, spatial differentiation is a strategy\n\
    applied ‘‘on top of’’ other measures to ensure optimal\nspatial location of the\
    \ other measures. Our assessments of\nthe effects of spatial differentiation to\
    \ increase the N-re-\nduction in groundwater have all been performed using\nDanish\
    \ standard norms for fertiliser application, where\nthere already are strict requirements\
    \ for N book-keeping\nand limits for fertiliser application (Hansen et al. 2017;\n\
    Hashemi et al. 2018a).\nModelling approaches\nKey characteristics of the study\
    \ areas and the focus of the\nmodelling studies are listed in Table 1. The main\
    \ objectives\nof the local case studies were to obtain improved under-\nstandings\
    \ of ﬂow paths, travel times and nutrient processes,\nenabling more accurate modelling\
    \ at small spatial scales,\nand to develop methods for upscaling of the processes\
    \ for\nuse across the Baltic Sea drainage basin. In the study areas\nin Denmark\
    \ (Hansen et al. 2019; Jakobsen et al. unpubl.\nresults), Sweden (Riml et al.\
    \ unpubl. results) and Poland\n(Wachniew et al. 2018) comprehensive ﬁeld studies\
    \ were\ncombined with detailed, small-scale models, while the\nfocus in the Russian\
    \ part of the Pregolya catchment was to\nFig. 1 Land cover classes in the Baltic\
    \ Sea drainage basin, with case study catchment locations outlined. Simpliﬁed\
    \ classiﬁcation based on\nGlobal Land Cover 2000 data (Bartholome´ and Belward\
    \ 2005)\n123\n\x02 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2019\nwww.kva.se/en\n1280\n\
    Ambio 2019, 48:1278–1289\nestablish a dataset enabling detailed calibration and\
    \ use of\nthe E-HYPE model for scenario analyses.\nWe quantiﬁed the potential\
    \ for increasing N-reduction in\ngroundwater\nby differentiation between ﬁelds\
    \ within\ncatchments. We analysed the beneﬁts of spatial targeting\nby considering\
    \ the N-leaching and N-reduction in spatial\nunits corresponding to small ﬁelds\
    \ (1–4 ha) and then\nrelocated the units with largest N-leaching to the units\
    \ with\nthe largest N-reduction (Hansen et al. 2017). In this way,\nthe natural\
    \ N-reduction is maximised and the N-load out of\nthe catchment is minimised.\
    \ The gain from the spatial\ntargeting is then the difference between the N-load\
    \ result-\ning from the actual location of the N-leaching and the\nN-load for\
    \ the relocated N-leaching. The idea behind this is\nthat the N-leaching is primarily\
    \ determined by the crop\nrotation and agricultural practices and is independent\
    \ of the\nN-reduction occurring in the groundwater, and hence the\nN-leaching\
    \ can be reduced by management actions to\nrelocate agricultural practices.\n\
    The pan-European setup (E-HYPE; Donnelly et al.\n2016) of the HYPE code (Lindstro¨m\
    \ et al. 2010) was used\nfor simulating ﬂows and nutrient ﬂuxes for the Baltic\
    \ Sea\ndrainage Basin. E-HYPE uses daily time steps and divides\nthe Baltic Sea\
    \ drainage basin into 7145 sub-basins with a\nmedian size of 215 km2. An upscaling\
    \ approach, described\nin detail by Hansen et al. (2018), was adopted for utilising\n\

    A broad range of policy instruments for a new governance\nregime based on a spatially\
    \ differentiated strategy were\nanalysed with focus on how to incentivise and\
    \ regulate\nagriculture under such a regime (Stelljes et al. 2017a). The\ninstruments\
    \ were evaluated via two workshops and inter-\nviews with local stakeholders in\
    \ each of the case areas in\nDenmark, Sweden and Poland, followed by workshops\n\
    with regional stakeholders in Germany, Sweden and a\ntransboundary workshop in\
    \ Poland/Russia. The case study\nareas have different histories and degrees of\
    \ agricultural\nregulation, as well as very large differences in stakeholder\n\
    awareness about the nutrient problem. Parallel to the\nworkshops and the work\
    \ on the policy options, ethno-\ngraphic studies were undertaken to understand\
    \ the culture-\ninduced knowledge and perceptions of the different\nstakeholder\
    \ groups (Stelljes et al. 2017b).\nFig. 2 N-reduction map with a 100-m resolution\

    \ approach\nThe upscaling approach developed for learning E-HYPE to\nsimulate\
    \ the changes in N-reduction in groundwater by\nspatially targeting of measures\
    \ is illustrated in Fig. 3. As a\nﬁrst step, the model structures and process\
    \ equations of the\nlocal scale models (MIKE SHE ? NLES) and the Baltic\nSea drainage\
    \ basin scale model (E-HYPE) were compared.\nThis resulted in a consistency check\
    \ of the baseﬂow frac-\ntions of the two models (successful) and a minor revision\n\
    of the HYPE model structure to provide a better repre-\nsentation of deep aquifers\
    \ and denitriﬁcation at individual\nsoil layers (Bartosova et al. 2018).\nSecondly,\
    \ additional data at Baltic Sea drainage basin\nscale consistent with the local\
    \ scale models were utilised.\nThis included discharge data for baseﬂow separation,\n\
    information on nitrate leaching at national and Baltic Sea\ndrainage basin scales\
    \ and a map of N-reduction in\ngroundwater (Højberg et al. 2017). With these new\
    \ data in\nplace, it turned out that there was no need to recalibrate\nE-HYPE\
    \ for baseﬂow fraction, but some recalibration was\nundertaken to ensure a reasonable\
    \ split of the N-reduction\nbetween surface water and groundwater. Next, the local\n\
    scale models were used to generate a generic relationship\nexpressing the relative\
    \ increase in N-reduction in ground-\nwater achievable by spatial targeting of\
    \ crop locations as a\nfunction of the percentage of arable land within the\n\
    catchment (Fig. 4). To reproduce this relationship in\nE-HYPE, the denitriﬁcation\
    \ rate in the groundwater zone\nwas changed as a function of the average N-leaching\
    \ and\nthe soil moisture content in the deepest soil layers in\nE-HYPE (Hansen\
    \ et al. 2018). The ability of this upscaling\nrelationship to reproduce the curve\
    \ in Fig. 4 in E-HYPE\nwas successful (Bartosova et al. 2018) after introducing\n\
    some limits to the maximum change in the denitriﬁcation\nparameter value (Fig.\
    \ 5). The upscaling relationship was\nsubsequently applied to predict the impact\
    \ of spatial dif-\nferentiation across the Baltic Sea drainage basin.\nPotential\
    \ beneﬁt: differentiation within catchments\nof N-reduction in groundwater\nThe\
    \ E-HYPE calculated potential for decreasing N-loads\nby implementing spatial\
    \ differentiation through changing\nthe location of agricultural land use and\
    \ management and\nthus increasing the N-reduction in groundwater is shown in\n\
    Fig. 6. The results show a substantial variation across the\nBaltic Sea drainage\
    \ basin with the largest decrease in\ngroundwater-dominated agricultural areas\
    \ in Denmark,\nGermany and Poland, while no decrease in N-load is pos-\nsible\
    \ in the most northern areas, where there is limited\ngroundwater and/or no agriculture.\
    \ For the entire Baltic\nSea, the N-load using this speciﬁc remediation measure\
    \ can\npotentially be lowered by 5%, while Denmark is the\ncountry with the largest\
    \ potential (20%).\nWhile the potential gain shown in Fig. 6 is considerable\n\
    in some of the regions, where the pressures from intensive\nagriculture are highest,\
    \ a number of constraining factors\nwill make the full potential unachievable\
    \ in practice. Some\nof these constraints have been analysed for two Danish\n\
    catchments (Norsminde and Odense) with summary results\nshown in Table 2 (Hansen\
    \ et al. 2017; Hashemi et al.\n2018a).\nAs shown in Table 2, the potential decrease\
    \ in N-load\n(upper limit) achievable by using N-reduction maps at\nﬁnest possible\

    \ in Norsminde and 26% in Odense. The\nlarge difference between the two catchments\
    \ is mainly due\nto differences in farming structures leading to a larger\nvariation\
    \ in N-leaching in Odense. Table 2 also shows the\neffects of practical agricultural\
    \ management constraints. If\ncrops cannot be relocated from one soil type to\
    \ another, the\nefﬁciency of differentiated regulation drops marginally in\nNorsminde\
    \ (from 8.0 to 7.7%), where one soil type covers\nmost of the catchment, while\
    \ the decrease in Odense\nhaving a wider diversity of soil types is larger (from\
    \ 26 to\n22%). If relocation of crops is not allowed over the entire\ncatchment,\
    \ but only within individual farms, the efﬁciency\ndrops signiﬁcantly, from 8.0\
    \ to 5.0% in Norsminde and\nfrom 26 to 17% in Odense.\nThe importance of using\
    \ high-resolution N-reduction\nmaps is also clear from Table 2. For Norsminde,\
    \ the gain\ndrops from 8.0% (100 m maps) to 6.2% (500 m maps) and\n5.6% (1000\
    \ m maps), while there is no gain left if the\nN-reduction is assumed constant\
    \ throughout the catchment\n(uniform regulation).\nThe N-reduction maps are uncertain\
    \ (Hansen et al.\n2014b). This implies that the decisions on cropping relo-\n\
    cations will not be optimal and hence the real gain will be\nless than the potential\
    \ gain. The importance of this is\nillustrated in Table 2 for Norsminde by a decrease\
    \ in the\ngain from 8.0% to somewhere between 6.1 and 7.4%.\nThese numbers only\

    DISCUSSION\nPotential beneﬁt for the Baltic Sea: the big picture\nSpatially differentiated\
    \ strategies for lowering N-loads can\nbe applied at different spatial scales.\
    \ Our analysis, which\nhas been conﬁned to spatial differentiation between ﬁelds\n\
    within catchments, suggests that the increased N-reduction\nin groundwater can\
    \ potentially lead to a 5% decrease in\ntotal N-load from the Baltic Sea drainage\
    \ basin. Consid-\nering larger spatial scales, Jacobsen and Hansen (2016)\nanalysed\
    \ differentiation between 23 catchments in Den-\nmark concluding that spatial\
    \ differentiation could lead to a\nlowering of the mitigation costs associated\
    \ with achieving\na particular N-load reduction target by about 25% as\ncompared\
    \ to uniform regulation. At the ﬁner spatial scales\n(differentiation within ﬁelds),\
    \ there is potential for reduc-\ning N-leaching through precision agriculture,\
    \ but Berntsen\net al. (2006) assessed this potential to likely be less than\n\
    5%.\nIn addition, restoration of natural wetlands and intro-\nduction of stream\
    \ remediation measures targeting increased\nN-reduction in surface water systems\
    \ have a substantial\npotential in most areas. Applying a new theoretical\nframework,\
    \ Riml et al. (unpubl. results) assessed that\noptimal location of stream remediation\
    \ measures in all\nsmall Swedish streams might lead to a decrease in N-load\n\
    of about 20%, while Bartosova et al. (2018), using the\nE-HYPE arrived at an estimate\
    \ of only around 1%.\nOur scientiﬁc contribution has been to provide a con-\n\
    solidated estimate for the potential reduction in N-load\narising from differentiation\
    \ between ﬁelds within catch-\nments. Considering literature on differentiation\
    \ between\ncatchments and precision agriculture, and notwithstanding\nthe large\
    \ uncertainty regarding the effects of stream\nremediation measures, the total\
    \ potential for using spatial\ndifferentiation strategies to decrease N-loads\
    \ from agri-\ncultural areas to the Baltic Sea in a cost-effective manner\nappears\
    \ large. As very limited experience exists with\nimplementation of spatially differentiated\
    \ strategies, there\nare a number of scientiﬁc and governance challenges that\n\
    need to be addressed before the potential gain can be\nachieved in practice.\n\
    Scientiﬁc challenges\nN-reduction maps\nN-reduction maps used for applying spatially\
    \ differen-\ntiated regulation must\nbe reasonably\naccurate and\ndetailed. Errors\
    \ in these maps will lead to non-optimal\nlocation of measures (Table 2). N-reduction\
    \ maps have\ntraditionally been estimated by combining measured\nnutrient ﬂuxes\
    \ at river gauging stations with model\ncalculated nutrient leaching from the\
    \ root zone within\nthe catchments upstream from the stations. This limits\nthe\
    \ spatial resolution of these maps to the catchment\nsizes deﬁned by the river\
    \ gauging station network, i.e.\noften several thousand km2 as in Wulff et al.\
    \ (2014). To\nderive N-reduction maps with ﬁner spatial resolution,\nsuch as shown\
    \ in Fig. 2, high-resolution modelling tools\nthat can exploit local data such\
    \ as topography, soil\ntypes, land use and geology are required.\nAnother challenge\
    \ is that N-reduction maps are\ndynamic. The N-reduction in the surface water\
    \ pathway\nis for instance a function of the remediation measures\nimplemented\
    \ in a particular river network and may\nhence change over time. Also, changes\
    \ in climatic\nconditions such as the amount and intensity of rainfall\nmay affect\
    \ the ﬂow pathways and thus the amount of\nN-reduction. Furthermore, the response\
    \ of groundwater\nsystems to nutrient loads is for some places affected by\nwater\
    \ residence times in the order of years or decades\n(Wachniew et al. 2018).\n\
    More local data: decreasing uncertainty\nA signiﬁcant part of the potential gain\
    \ from spatial dif-\nferentiation lies in exploiting the variability in N-reduction\n\
    within catchments, i.e. at scales where we usually have\nlimited data. We know\
    \ that prediction uncertainties based\non the existing data can often be so large\
    \ at ﬁeld scale that\nthis in practice makes spatially differentiated regulation\n\
    non-feasible. We also know that the uncertainties in esti-\nmating N-reduction\
    \ in groundwater can typically be sig-\nniﬁcantly decreased by using more data\
    \ (Hansen et al.\n2014b). However, data collection with traditional sampling\n\
    schemes is expensive. Hence, there is a need to link\nuncertainty assessments\
    \ and the extent to which more and\nbetter data will decrease uncertainties to\
    \ support decisions\non investments in collecting new or additional data.\nHashemi\
    \ et al. (2018b) showed that information on the\nuncertainty of N-reduction at\
    \ ﬁne spatial scale can be used\nto optimise spatial targeting and thus increase\
    \ cost-\neffectiveness.\n\x02 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2019\nwww.kva.se/en\n\
    123\nAmbio 2019, 48:1278–1289\n1285\nUpscaling\nAll models are scale dependent,\
    \ and a model that is\nparameterised and calibrated to make predictions at a\n\
    particular scale does often not have predictive capabilities\nat smaller scales\
    \ (Refsgaard et al. 1999). To adequately\nanalyse impacts of small-scale spatially\
    \ differentiated\nmeasures at the Baltic Sea drainage basin scale, it is\ntherefore\
    \ required to combine small-scale and large-scale\nmodels.\nAlthough large-scale\
    \ models generally rely more on\ncalibration than small-scale models, E-HYPE has\
    \ relatively\nlittle data available for calibration, typically only dis-\ncharges\
    \ and nutrient concentrations measured at river\ngauging stations. While this\
    \ allows calibration of the\nN-reduction at scales corresponding to the sub-basins\n\
    upstream of the gauging stations, it also leads to equiﬁ-\nnality (Beven 2006)\
    \ in the sense that many combinations of\nparameter values with different splits\
    \ between N-reduction\nin surface water and in groundwater can provide the same\n\
    overall N-reduction. As illustrated in Fig. 3, we therefore\nadd additional basin-wide\
    \ datasets (baseﬂow separation of\ndischarge, maps for N-reduction in groundwater,\
    \ maps for\nN-leaching) as proxy observational data for recalibrations\nof E-HYPE.\
    \ Furthermore, we used simulation results from\nsmall-scale models to develop\
    \ an upscaling relationship\nenabling E-HYPE now to simulate the impact of spatially\n\
    differentiated measures implemented in terms of increased\nN-reduction in groundwater.\
    \ This in reality implies con-\nstraining E-HYPE to reproduce results comparable\
    \ with\nthose from detailed small-scale models. In this way, we\nexpect that the\
    \ equiﬁnality level in E-HYPE will be\nreduced such that it will, to a greater\
    \ extent, simulate the\n‘‘right answers for the right reasons’’. This improves\
    \ the\nconﬁdence in model predictions, when E-HYPE is used in\nscenario analyses\
    \ to assess impacts of future changes in\nclimate, land use and agricultural practice.\n\
    In constraining E-Hype in this way to reduce equiﬁ-\nnality, we use so-called\
    \ dynamic upscaling (Bronstert et al.\n2007). A critical assumption here is that\
    \ our small-scale\nmodels, with their more advanced process descriptions and\n\
    ability to utilise more of the existing system data, have\nsufﬁcient predictability,\
    \ and that our case studies have\nsufﬁcient representativeness to allow model\
    \ outputs to be\nused for constraining E-HYPE in other parts of the Baltic\nSea\
    \ drainage basin.\nGovernance challenges\nUncertainty and spatial scales\nResults\
    \ from modelling studies in the Norsminde catch-\nment suggest that the level\
    \ of uncertainty inherent in the\nN-reduction maps can be very high (Hansen et\
    \ al. 2014b).\nFigure 7 shows that the uncertainty regarding N-reduction\nis very\
    \ large at 100 m (1 ha) resolution, but the uncertainty\ndecreases considerably\
    \ if the N-reduction results are\naggregated to larger spatial scales. To exploit\
    \ the full\npotential of spatial differentiation, N-reduction maps with a\nﬁne\
    \ spatial resolution (1–25 ha) are necessary. The poten-\ntial gain decreases\
    \ as the spatial scale of the N-reduction\nbecomes coarser, and uncertainty and\
    \ gain thereby coun-\nteract (Hansen et al. 2017).\nBefore these uncertainty assessments\
    \ were made, the\nDanish government had the intention to use N-reduction\nmaps\
    \ at ﬁeld scale as a basis for government regulation.\nHowever, the level of uncertainty\
    \ shown in Fig. 7 was so\nhigh that it scared both key stakeholders and government\n\
    authorities from using them in a regulatory context. For\nthis reason, the Danish\
    \ government currently uses N-re-\nduction maps at around 1500 km2 resolution\
    \ in regulation,\nwhile 15 km2 resolution is used for prioritising voluntary\n\
    N-mitigation measures. While the coarse scale maps have a\nlower level of uncertainty,\
    \ their use also removes most of\nthe economic and environmental gains from a\
    \ spatial\ndifferentiation.\nThe fact that N-reduction maps with ﬁne spatial reso-\n\
    lution are required to exploit the potential beneﬁts of spa-\ntial differentiation,\
    \ but that the uncertainties on maps with\nsuch ﬁne resolution are so large that\
    \ they appear to prevent\nauthorities from using them with the existing governance\n\
    regimes, is a major challenge. If on one hand, when cen-\ntralised top-down regulation\
    \ is used, imposing (tough)\nrestrictions, farmers will question the basis for\
    \ the regu-\nlation, and hence a very high certainty is required and the\nauthority\
    \ will carry the responsibility for that uncertainty.\nIf on the other hand, when\
    \ more bottom-up/co-governance\nis used in a management context, i.e. to inform\
    \ how to\nreduce the load in the best way possible, then a higher\nuncertainty\
    \ can be accepted. And farmers are used to living\nwith their own decisions, taken\
    \ under uncertainty, e.g.\nrelated to weather and market conditions. However,\
    \ this\nbottom-up process may be seen from the authorities as\nimposing a potential\
    \ lack of control.\nGovernance regimes\nA key governance challenge of spatially\
    \ differentiated\nregulation is that different farmers, even neighbours, will\n\
    have different N-reduction on their land areas (see Fig. 2).\nHence, if measures\
    \ such as fertilisation norms are made\ndependent on the small-scale N-reduction\
    \ maps, then\nfarmers will have different allowable fertilisation rates, and\n\
    the respective advantages/disadvantages will very quickly\nbe capitalised via\
    \ land prices. Results from our workshops\nsuggest that for this to be acceptable\
    \ to farmers some kind\n123\n\x02 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2019\nwww.kva.se/en\n\
    1286\nAmbio 2019, 48:1278–1289\nof compensational payments will be required. This\
    \ issue is\nfurther complicated by the considerable uncertainty on the\nsmall-scale\
    \ N-reduction maps implying that additional data\nmay cause signiﬁcant modiﬁcations\
    \ to the maps.\nOne way to obtain more local data and at the same time\nget ownership\
    \ among farmers is to empower farmers to\ncollect data from their own ﬁelds and\
    \ let these data become\npart of the overall decision basis. Such citizen data\
    \ col-\nlection approaches require new affordable data collection\ntechniques.\n\
    The ﬁndings from stakeholder workshops and ethno-\ngraphic studies in Poland,\
    \ Sweden and Denmark (Stelljes\net al. 2017b) showed that the most promising application\
    \ of\nspatial differentiation can be expected within a co-gover-\nnance approach,\
    \ where a large amount of responsibility is\nshifted to local farmers or to catchment\
    \ councils. While the\nresponsibility would not include the deﬁnition of the\n\
    abatement targets, it would include the responsibility for\nfulﬁlling commitments\
    \ under those targets. This includes\ndesigning and implementing mitigation measures\
    \ (placing\nof wetlands, change of land use, etc.), collaboration among\nthe farmers\
    \ within the catchment, as well as internal\nmonitoring of measures and loadings.\
    \ Trust, along with a\nrepetition of the situation (same people and activities)\
    \ and\nthe reputation of others’ past actions, is crucial to the\nsuccess of such\
    \ collective action.\nThe present governance practice in the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation can be characterised as a centralised approach. This\nallows spatially differentiated\
    \ regulation by setting abate-\nment targets at the level of administrative units\
    \ (Domnin\net al. 2015) based on the quota of nutrient load reduction\nresulting\
    \ from area-apportioning in the Baltic Sea Action\nPlan (HELCOM 2013). Hence,\

    \ measures\nat ﬁner spatial scales than administrative units and co-\ngovernance\
    \ appears infeasible under the Russian Federa-\ntion’s present governance approach.\n\
    CONCLUSION\nAs the need for reduction in nutrient loading from agri-\nculture\
    \ to marine environments continues, and in many\ncountries the cheapest remediation\
    \ measures have already\nbeen utilised, the requirement for designing innovative,\n\
    cost-effective nutrient reduction measures increases. Spa-\ntial differentiation\
    \ targeting mitigation measures at areas\nwith low natural N-reduction in groundwater\
    \ and surface\nwater holds a signiﬁcant potential to be cost-effective\ncompared\
    \ to the traditional strategy of applying measures\nuniformly across a particular\
    \ catchment or throughout an\nentire country. We have quantiﬁed the potential\
    \ gain from\nincreasing the N-reduction in groundwater by differentia-\ntion of\
    \ agricultural practices between ﬁelds in catchments\nto be substantial for agriculturally\
    \ intensive, groundwater-\ndominated areas in Denmark, Germany and Poland. Con-\n\
    sidering also other possibilities for spatial differentiation\nsuch as differentiation\
    \ between catchments, precision\nagriculture and targeted remediation measures\
    \ in streams\nand wetlands, the total potential for spatially differentiated\n\
    strategies appears to be large. However, several scientiﬁc\nand governance challenges\
    \ remain to be solved before\nthese can be fully implemented.\nAcknowledgement\

    Abstract

    Dominant food systems are configured from the productivist paradigm, which focuses
    on producing large

    amounts of inexpensive and standardized foods. Although these food systems continue
    being supported world-

    wide, they are no longer considered fit-for-purpose as they have been proven unsustainable
    in environmental and

    social terms. A large body of scientific literature argues that a transition from
    the dominant food systems to

    alternative ones built around the wider principles of sustainable production and
    rural development is needed.

    Promoting such a sustainability transition would benefit from a diagnosis of food
    system types to identify those

    systems that may harbor promising characteristics for a transition to sustainable
    food systems. While research on

    food system transitions abounds, an operational approach to characterize the diversity
    of food systems taking a

    system perspective is still lacking. In this paper we review the literature on
    how transitions to sustainable food

    systems may play out and present a framework based on the Multi-Level Perspective
    on Socio-Technical

    Transitions, which builds upon conceptual developments from social and natural
    science disciplines. The objec-

    tives of the framework are to (i) characterize the diversity of existing food
    systems at a certain geographical

    scale based on a set of structural characteristics and (ii) classify the food
    systems in terms of their support by

    mainstream practices, i.e., dominant food systems connected to regimes; deviate
    radically from them, niche food

    systems such as those based on grassroots innovation; or share elements of dominant
    and niche food systems,

    i.e., hybrid food systems. An example is given of application of our framework
    to vegetable food systems with a

    focus on production, distribution, and consumption of low-or-no pesticide vegetables
    in Chile. Drawing on this

    illustrative example we reflect on usefulness, shortcomings, and further development
    and use of the diagnostic

    framework.

    1 Introduction

    Food systems are generally conceived as the network of actors

    and activities that interact with one another, within an ecologi-

    cal, social, political/cultural, and economic environment.

    Activities include growing, processing, distributing, consum-

    ing, and disposing of foods, from provision of inputs to waste

    and recycling (Ericksen 2008; IPES-Food 2015). Beyond the

    actors involved directly in these activities, food systems also

    comprise the structural conditions (e.g., rules, standards, poli-

    cies), and dedicated agents (e.g., actors in public and private

    organizations such as extension services and research) that sup-

    port daily operation as well as continuous optimization and

    innovation of the systems (IPES-Food 2015). Multiple interac-

    tions between the actors, activities, structural conditions, and

    dedicated agents lead to different configurations of food sys-

    tems, which can be linked to multiple co-existing production/

    consumption paradigms and values (e.g., productivist para-

    digm, life science paradigm, ecological and health paradigm,

    re-localization paradigm) (Lamine 2015; Lang and Heasman

    2015; Plumecocq et al. 2018). The configuration of a food

    system influences its performance in terms of three normative

    food system goals, i.e., food security and nutrition, environ-

    mental security, and social welfare (Ingram 2011).

    Historically, the global food system has been ordered by

    specific rules and structures governing the production, circu-

    lation, and consumption of food on a world scale, which or-

    ganize the accumulation of capital in the agri-food sector

    (McMichael 2009). This is what Friedmann and McMichael

    (1989) have conceptualized as “food regimes,” periods and

    patterns in capitalist history where agriculture has played a

    strategic role. At present, many food systems in different

    countries are in one way or another influenced by the

    established food regime, which McMichael (2009) calls the

    corporate food regime, for example, influenced by current

    international patterns of trade and the increasing emergence

    of agro-business corporations and industries that often deter-

    mine what farmers produce and how value added is distribut-

    ed (Clapp 2018; O''Kane 2012; Therond et al. 2017). The

    corporate food regime embodies the productivist paradigm

    rooted in the green revolution, in which food systems enact

    an industrial approach to food and farming, with state and

    industry support primarily geared to producing large amounts

    of standardized foods (Lang and Heasman 2015; Lowe et al.

    1993; Therond et al. 2017), often leaving aside environmental

    and societal food system goals (Dobermann et al. 2013; IPES-

    Food 2015; O''Kane 2012). The productivist paradigm to

    which many food systems adhere has resulted in strong neg-

    ative environmental and social impacts around the world

    (Baroni et al. 2006; Black et al. 2011; Ericksen 2008;

    Tittonell et al. 2016). On top of these impacts, some have

    argued that the dominant food systems, which are the food

    systems aligned to the corporate food regime, are ineffective

    at feeding the world population (Tittonell et al. 2016), of

    which still close to 800 million people go hungry and over 1

    billion are overweight (FAO, UNICEF, WFP, WHO 2017).

    A wide body of scientific literature has argued that so-

    called sustainability transitions are needed to enable a trans-

    formation from the existing corporate food regime to an alter-

    native regime configured around the wider principles of sus-

    tainable production and rural development (Brunori et al.

    2013; Hinrichs 2014; Holt-Giménez and Altieri 2013; Holt-

    Giménez and Shattuck 2011; Hubeau et al. 2017; Ingram

    2015; Meynard et al. 2017). Within this body of work studies

    look at different issues in agricultural and food system sustain-

    ability transitions such as transformative change agency,

    science-driven and grassroot transition movements, stability

    of the food regime and lock-in, and the interaction between

    innovation networks and the incumbent food regime (see, for

    example, Bui et al. 2016; Diaz et al. 2013; Elzen et al. 2004;

    Ingram 2015; Ingram and Maye 2016; Klerkx et al. 2010;

    Lamine 2011; Lamine et al. 2012; Levidow et al. 2014;

    Meynard et al. 2017; Rossi 2017; van der Ploeg et al. 2004;

    Tisdell 2001). Such sustainability transitions may follow dif-

    ferent pathways in enacting different alternative paradigms for

    shaping future food systems (Pigford et al. 2018; Plumecocq

    et al. 2018). Whichever sustainability transition pathway is

    chosen (Roep and Wiskerke 2004; Plumecocq et al. 2018), a

    common aspect of any pathway is that it requires coupled

    innovations in technologies (e.g., agronomic practices, pro-

    cessing and recycling technologies) and in non-technological

    domains (e.g., cooperation between food system actors, dif-

    ferent upstream and downstream organizational arrangements,

    and consumption practices), in activities of growing, process-

    ing, distributing, consuming, and disposing of foods

    (Meynard et al. 2017), as well as dedicated change agents

    and networks that promote these transitions (e.g., grassroot

    social movements such as in agroecology) (Bui et al. 2016;

    Klerkx et al. 2010, 2012; Lamine et al. 2012; Roep et al. 2003)

    to deal with power structures in large systems (Dentoni et al.

    2017; Pigford et al. 2018).

    A number of alternative paradigms proposing sets of tech-

    nological and non-technological innovations to foster sustain-

    ability transition pathways have emerged that can inspire and

    enable the redesign of current dominant food systems. A first

    category comprises a set of innovations representing a move

    towards the ecological modernization of food systems by rec-

    onciling agriculture, food production, and the environment.

    Examples include sustainable intensification (Garnett et al.

    2013), input-substitution production systems (Singh et al.

    2011), climate smart agriculture (Lipper et al. 2014), precision

    agriculture (Gebbers and Adamchuk 2010; Rains et al. 2011),

    eco-efficiency (Carberry et al. 2013), environmental-friendly

    food-processing technologies (Barbosa- Cánovas and Gould

    2000), and food-packaging alternatives (Han 2013). Although

    commonly advocated as “sustainable,” some commentators

    see many of these innovations as incremental, only perpetuat-

    ing current industrialized modes of production, distribution,

    and consumption of foods (Loos et al. 2014; Maye and

    Duncan 2017; Rosset and Altieri 1997). These incremental

    innovations have been argued to be associated with the selec-

    tive appropriation by dominant food systems of the ecological

    and health agendas of social and environmental movements.

    Friedmann (2005) elaborates on this idea by suggesting the

    possible emergence of a food regime named as the “corporate-

    environmental food regime.” A second set of innovations may

    exemplify a more radical move away from the productivist

    paradigm towards multi-functional and ecological agricultural

    production systems (Doré et al. 2011; Duru et al. 2015;

    Tittonell et al. 2016), and decentralized, differentiated, local-

    ized, and ecological value chains (Feagan 2007; Maye and

    Kirwan 2010; Tregear 2011), which are supported by quality

    conventions embedded in trust, tradition, and place (Feagan

    2007) (Fig. 1). These innovations seek to overcome “business-

    as-usual” solutions to sustainability issues by reshaping food

    practices, not only from a technical perspective but also

    through changes in social interactions and modes of organiza-

    tion (Lamine et al. 2012). These innovations include, among

    others, production of food based on ecological intensification

    (Doré et al. 2011; Tittonell et al. 2016) and biodiversity-based

    agriculture (Duru et al. 2015), supported by multiple forms of

    alternative food networks (AFNs) such as community-

    supported agriculture (CSA), food cooperatives, farmers’ mar-

    kets, or box schemes (Renting et al. 2003). These innovations

    in food systems could play a radical role in the transition from

    the corporate food regime towards a new and more sustainable

    regime (Holt-Giménez and Shattuck 2011).

    While there is thus a growing body of research in the sus-

    tainability transition literature interested in food systems, we

    identify two knowledge gaps. First, although this body of

    research makes reference to sustainability transition in food

    systems, a “whole food systems” approach still remains lim-

    ited (Markard et al. 2012). The focus is commonly on the farm

    component of the food system without putting due attention to

    coupled innovations in all other components that are part of

    the food system. Second, research have often focused on

    unraveling transition dynamics within certain projects or in-

    novation niches that work on alternative food systems. There

    is still a lack of an operational approach that enables a diag-

    nosis in a given country or region about what are the (a)

    various dominant food systems and (b) the alternatives to

    dominant ones that may harbor promising innovations for

    improving or changing unsustainable systems and that are

    creating new contexts of opportunities for a transition process.

    Such an approach could be both useful to inform research on

    food regimes and food system transitions, as well as policy

    makers to guide investments and see how they can orient their

    innovation policies to support certain desired transition path-

    ways and counteract undesired dominant systems (following

    Kivimaa and Kern 2016).

    In this paper both literature gaps are addressed by pre-

    senting an integrated and structured conceptual and meth-

    odological framework that provides a diagnostic tool that

    enables a characterization of the diversity of food systems

    that co-exist within a given geographical area such as a

    country, in order to identify patterns of more and less sus-

    tainable characteristics. This framework takes into account

    the multi-dimensional characteristics of food systems and,

    therefore, integrates and builds upon existing concepts in

    agronomy, value chain management, innovation systems,

    food system governance, and environmental sciences. It

    complements other frameworks which for example look

    at food system sustainability performance metrics (Zurek

    et al. 2018). The operational objectives of our framework

    are to (i) enable a characterization of food systems based

    on their structural characteristics and (ii) enable a classifi-

    cation of the food systems from dominant food systems to

    niche food systems and hybrid forms. After describing our

    framework (Sect. 2), this paper introduces a

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    Page 3 of 22

    1

    methodological approach that combines multiple methods

    of data collection for implementation of the framework

    (Sect. 3). To illustrate how the framework may be opera-

    tionalized, an example is given of application of our frame-

    work to vegetable food systems in Chile with a focus on

    production, distribution, and consumption of low-or-no

    pesticide vegetables. Drawing on this illustrative example

    we reflect on the usefulness, shortcomings, and further

    development and use of the framework (Sects. 4 and 5).

    2 Characterizing food system diversity:

    a framework

    2.1 The multi-level perspective framework

    The food regime perspective has been widely used to understand

    the global food system and its crisis as part of a broader historical

    understanding of the global drivers and the geo-political and

    economic conditions (McMichael 2009), using essentially a

    global political economy approach (Pereira and Drimie 2016).

    It seems to be less appropriate to unravel the dynamics of the

    multiple coupled innovation processes in food systems at lower

    spatial levels, i.e., regional or national. These are specifically

    captured by another prominent approach, which has emerged

    in parallel to analyze sustainability transitions in food systems,

    i.e., how sustainability innovations emerge, scale out, and influ-

    ence the way food systems are configured. This approach is the

    so-called multi-level perspective (MLP) proposed by Geels

    (2002), which has been applied to sectors such as energy, trans-

    port, and food (Hinrichs 2014). Generally speaking, the MLP

    proposes that transitions emerge from the complex interplay

    of processes occurring at, and between, three intertwined

    levels: (1) the socio-technical regime (meso-level), (2) the

    niches (micro-level), and (3) the socio-technical landscape

    (macro-level) (Fig. 2).

    The MLP definition of socio-technical regime comes from

    a tradition of looking at the evolutionary character of coupled

    socio-technological change and refers to socio-technical re-

    gimes as coherent sets of social and technological elements

    that underpin basic societal functions (Holtz et al. 2008),

    among them, the production, commercialization, and con-

    sumption of food. This notion of regime postulates that a

    given system is locked-in by path dependency and stability

    (Wieczorek 2018), and therefore, it seeks to maintain its dom-

    inant position generally by favoring trajectories of incremental

    adjustments to fix problems within the regime (Ingram 2015).

    Due to its stabilizing features, the socio-technical regime gen-

    erally blocks the emergence of radical innovations that chal-

    lenge the rules about how the system operates (Ingram 2015;

    Meynard et al. 2017). Such radical innovations are commonly

    generated in niches (Geels 2002). The niches are alternative

    socio-technical systems that provide a protected space for de-

    velopment of new technologies, new concepts, and new ways

    of organization and of doing things (van der Ploeg et al. 2004).

    In the MLP, it is acknowledged that tensions within the socio-

    technical regime as well as exogenous macro-trends (e.g., cli-

    mate change, occurrence of earthquakes, droughts, or hurri-

    canes) and endogenous macro-trends (socio-technical regimes

    pertaining to other sectors, e.g., energy, health, tourism, and

    mobility) create pressure on both niches and socio-technical

    regimes, and provide a space for change (Avelino 2017).

    These macro-trends are referred to as the socio-technical land-

    scape. Interactions between the niche, regime, and landscape

    levels lead to a whole set of transition pathways. These path-

    ways emanate from efforts by the niche actors in collaboration

    with regime actors or from the regime itself (Ingram 2015;

    Klerkx et al. 2010) and can be of a more incremental or radical

    nature (Ingram 2015).

    2.2 Food systems through the lens of the MLP

    Characterizing the diversity of co-existing food systems in a

    certain geographical area fits well with the MLP. The socio-

    technical regime manifests in the way dominant food systems

    are configured and how they perform (Ingram 2015). The

    technical elements of the regime in case of food systems in-

    clude physical inputs, plant-breeding techniques, harvesting

    technologies, transport and logistics, food processing, and

    recycling technologies. The social elements involve the pre-

    vailing attitudes towards farming, the conception of sustain-

    ability, ideas about nutritional value, policy measures, price-

    support mechanisms, and the organized interests, among

    many others (Ingram 2015; Smith et al. 2010). To distinguish

    it from the concept of “food regimes” sensu Friedmann and

    McMichael (1989), and to make it more applicable to food

    systems analysis at, for example, country level, we use the

    term “food system regime.” The rules and structures of the

    corporate food regime manifest in a given country dependent

    on the particular actors and the biophysical, infrastructural,

    and institutional conditions in that country. A food system

    regime in a country typically represents mainstream social

    and technical elements dominated by conventional industrial

    farming and value chains controlled by large-scale and pow-

    erful agri-food industries and companies (Morrissey et al.

    2014; Pitt and Jones 2016). This food system regime may also

    include structures and rules for the greening of food produc-

    tion, retailing, and consumption, as was the case for organic

    agriculture that has become conventionalized and industrial-

    ized in last decades (Darnhofer et al. 2010).

    Tensions within the food system regime and ongoing land-

    scape pressures (the macro-level in the MLP) destabilize the

    food system regime and create opportunities for innovations

    to emerge both within the dominant food systems, which are

    aligned and supported by the food system regime, and in

    niches (the micro-level in the MLP) (Avelino 2017; Smith

    et al. 2010). For example, the impacts of climate change on

    agriculture may open the space for the adoption of (novel)

    farming practices that allow adapting agriculture to extreme

    weather events. As a second example, the pressures of social

    movements and consumers advocating more healthy food

    may create the opportunity for closer farmer-consumer rela-

    tionships or may lead to adoption of new food safety control

    systems throughout the value chain. The food system regime

    is often locked-in on generating incremental innovations that

    solve problems within the regime. The food system regime

    functions to maintain the status quo and therefore to margin-

    alize or co-opt more radical innovations (Ingram 2015). These

    radical innovations are often developed in niches, spaces in

    which the collective action of diverse actors is facilitated to

    develop multiple alternative solutions to advance to more sus-

    tainable ways of producing, commercializing, and consuming

    of food (Klerkx et al. 2010 in Ingram 2015; Pigford et al.

    2018).

    A transition in food systems can occur when niches interact

    with the food system regime. Innovations in niches can fit-

    Fig. 2 The multi-level view of transitions (Geels 2002). Adapted from Ollivier
    et al. (2018)

    and-conform to the food system regime or they can stretch-

    and-transform it (see Smith and Raven (2012) for a detailed

    description of fit-and-conform and stretch-and transform).

    Whether the niches fit-and-conform to the food system regime

    or stretch-and-transform it depends on different factors such as

    the niches’ internal dynamics, their interactions with the food

    system regime and with other niches, and their ambition to

    transform the food system regime (Darnhofer et al. 2015). A

    transition to sustainable food systems may not be entirely

    driven by niche actors but may also rely upon actors in the

    food system regime that champion different transition path-

    ways and are capable of fostering these changes (Ingram

    2015; Smith and Raven 2012). Considering that the actors

    and activities that constitute a food system are all strongly

    interconnected, both regime-induced and niche-induced inno-

    vations, either of an incremental or radical nature, may lead to

    multiple co-existing food systems within a country, i.e., con-

    figurations of dominant food systems that may share some

    elements but differ in others and are supported by the food

    system regime, and configurations of niche food systems that

    challenge the way the dominant food systems operate. As the

    boundaries between the dominant food systems and the niche

    food systems are blurry and permeable, hybrid food systems

    constituted by a mix of regime-induced and niche-induced

    innovations may also exist. These systems are organized and

    perform at the crossroads of the food system regime and the

    niche food systems (Lamine et al. 2012; Plumecocq et al.

    2018), and often involve actors in the food system regime that

    are sympathetic to the innovations of the niche food systems

    (Darnhofer et al. 2015).

    In the next section we introduce and describe the structural

    characteristics by which co-existing food systems can be char-

    acterized and can be classified as dominant food systems,

    niches, and hybrid forms.

    2.3 Characterizing the diversity of food systems

    The framework presented here characterizes and maps the di-

    versity of existing food systems in terms of their transition

    pathways, i.e., dominant food systems supported and aligned

    to the food system regime, niche food systems, and hybrid

    forms, based on a set of structural characteristics. These struc-

    tural conditions have different configurations depending on

    whether they connect to the food system regime, niche food

    systems, and hybrid forms. A common point in different at-

    tempts to characterize food systems is that three interrelated

    food system components are distinguished: (i) the agricultural

    production system, (ii) the value chain, and (iii) the structures

    for support of innovation and everyday functioning of agricul-

    tural production systems and value chains (hereafter support

    structures) (Fig. 3a). The three components of a food system

    are individually and jointly influenced and (de)stabilized by the

    socio-technical landscape. In the long term the components of

    a food system may influence the socio-technical landscape.

    Final outcomes of the food system vary in terms of food secu-

    rity and nutrition, environmental security, and social welfare,

    depending on how the food system is configured (Fig. 3a).

    The first component of a food system, the agricultural

    production system, comprises the farm structure and the set

    of agricultural practices that producers mobilize to transform

    land, capital, and labor into useful products that can be con-

    sumed or sold (Fresco and Westphal 1988; Boiffin et al. 2004

    in Le Gal et al. 2011). The agricultural production system may

    comprise cropping and livestock systems that interact with the

    environment. The second component, the value chain, com-

    prises the network of horizontally and vertically related value

    chain actors such as traders, wholesalers, processors, retailers,

    and exporters that operate jointly to bring agricultural prod-

    ucts to consumers (Trienekens 2011), who, themselves, are

    also part of the value chain. Value is added by each activity

    of the chain (Schneemann and Vredeveld 2015). The horizon-

    tal dimension reflects the relationships between actors in the

    same value chain activity (e.g., marketing cooperatives,

    farmers’ associations, and collaborative agreements between

    processors). Vertical relationships reflect how value chain ac-

    tors organize and coordinate themselves to bring the products

    from the primary producer to the final consumer (Trienekens

    2011). To allocate and mobilize resources and to coordinate

    and control the horizontal and vertical relationships some

    form of governance is necessary (Provan and Kenis 2008).

    The third component, the support structures, refers to the

    structures that influence the creation, adoption, and dissemi-

    nation of innovations (e.g., through fiscal incentives to R&D);

    provide support to agricultural producers and value chain ac-

    tors to obtain information, skills, capabilities, and technolo-

    gies to solve everyday problems; and enable various forms of

    interaction and learning processes at different geographic

    levels (Davis 2008; Edler and Fagerberg 2017). These struc-

    tures are comprised by public and private research and devel-

    opment (R&D) activities and programs, extension services

    that include grassroot knowledge-sharing systems, and eco-

    nomic and innovation policy.

    Agricultural production systems, value chains, and the sup-

    port structures are diverse. An example of this heterogeneity is

    illustrated in Fig. 3b. Multiple setups of support structures co-

    exist, e.g., varying innovation policy mixes, multiple public

    and private R&D agendas, priorities to solve sustainability

    related issues, and different approaches for extension. Each

    of these setups of structures may either support innovation

    and everyday functioning of dominant modes of food produc-

    tion and value chains, and thus reproduce the current state of

    affairs, or they may provide the structural conditions to sup-

    port the development of innovations of a more radical nature

    (Schut et al. 2015). Some structures of a given setup may also

    be shared or may be overlapped across different food systems.

    At the same time, a given setup may be a factor that constrains

    1

    Page 6 of 22

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    the development of innovations or causes the innovations to

    fail. For example, by subsidizing fossil fuel-based agrochem-

    icals and commodity crops, governmental policies may pro-

    mote food production in industrialized monoculture agricul-

    tural production systems that primarily benefit larger multi-

    national agribusiness (Kremen et al. 2012). This was the case,

    for example, for the EU Common Agricultural Policy that

    provided agricultural subsidies proportional to farmed area,

    thus favoring large-scale and industrial farming (IPES-Food

    2016). At the same time, implementation of these policies

    creates obstacles to the adoption of more radical innovations

    in food production by disfavoring food that do not use these

    external inputs, e.g., those of agroecological and organic ori-

    gin. Alternatively, support structures such as farmer field

    schools, agroecological policies, and NGOs as well as grass-

    root networks and social movements could bring about con-

    ditions for joint learning processes among food system actors

    for adoption and distribution of food products coming from

    ecologically intensive agricultural production systems. Hence,

    these multiple setups of support structures heavily influence

    how the agricultural producers and value chain actors build

    their strategies by adopting and/or developing technologies

    and modes of economic organization that best adapt to the

    environment.

    Agricultural producers can opt or may be forced, as result of

    the growing concentration and power of downstream and up-

    stream corporations and industries, to organize their systems

    following dominant modes of food production, which are based

    on strongly simplified crop sequences, standardized crop man-

    agement, and systematic use of chemical inputs (Therond et al.

    2017). At the other side of the spectrum, producers can opt to

    avoid or reduce their dependence on purchased inputs and fol-

    low ecologically more intensive approaches to food production

    such as agroecology, diversified production systems, some

    forms of organic agriculture, and permaculture (Tittonell

    2014a). Between these two extremes, a continuum of

    agricultural production systems and value chains (number 3) and food

    system outcomes (number 4). The three components influence and are

    influenced individually or jointly by the socio-technical landscape

    (number 5). The conceptualized food system builds on Ericksen’s

    agricultural production systems may co-exist. Some examples

    include agricultural production systems belonging to small-

    holders that are constrained by resources such as land, water,

    energy, phosphorous, and nitrogen, and input-substitution sys-

    tems in which producers seek to replace some of the conven-

    tional chemical inputs with more “environmentally friendly in-

    puts” while maintaining the principles and values of conven-

    tional agriculture (Therond et al. 2017). As an example, in Fig.

    3b (number 1), agricultural production system types are distin-

    guished by the level of ecological intensification of production

    and the attainable productivity on a per hectare basis (adapted

    from Tittonell et al. 2016). Many other variables may be mobi-

    lized to characterize agricultural production systems, e.g., area,

    provision of ecosystem services, labor, and mechanization.

    In value chains, organization, coordination, and operation of

    downstream and upstream activities can take many forms. For

    example, value chain actors may take part in hierarchical value

    chains with administrative control; actors may join value chains

    with loose and non-exclusive relationships; actors may partici-

    pate individually in value chains with little or no formal coop-

    eration; or actors can opt to be organized collectively and oper-

    ate in cooperation to address value chain requirements. As it is

    the case with producers, the ongoing concentration of the agri-

    food industry in many parts of the world can serve to limit the

    choices of actors to participate in certain value chains (see Weis

    2007; Ros-Tonen et al. 2015; Kilelu et al. 2017 for a detailed

    description). As an example of the heterogeneity in the organi-

    zation and operation of value chains, in Fig. 3b (number 2), the

    features power asymmetry between value chain actors and trust

    and commitment towards the chain are used to distinguish four

    types of value chains (adapted from Duncan and Pascucci

    2017). In the example, value chain types range from hierarchi-

    cal and formalized value chains, in which actors are often fully

    dependent on a specific value chain party (e.g., large processor

    or large retailer), to democratic and territorially embedded value

    chains that organize themselves at the community-level around

    trust and horizontal decision making. Many other variables may

    be mobilized to characterize value chains, e.g., transaction

    costs, size of the value chain, goal of each value chain actor,

    and asset specificity in value chains.

    Combining a type of agricultural production system with a

    type of value chain(s), along with their enabling and

    encompassing setup of support structures, results in multiple

    types of food systems that can be classified as dominant food

    systems, niche food systems, or hybrid forms. Dominant food

    systems will be those that are supported by mainstream practices

    in agricultural production systems and value chains, niche food

    systems will be those systems whose practices deviate radically

    from those that are found in the dominant food systems, and

    hybrid food systems will be those systems that represent hetero-

    geneity and dissent within the food system regime. These sys-

    tems are sympathetic to some niche innovations but are mainly

    constituted by mainstream practices. Hybrid systems may be

    promising in transition processes as they may foster broader

    processes of change, by creating linkages between the niche

    food systems and the food system regime. Building from Fig.

    3b, an example of multiple food systems is illustrated in Fig. 4.

    In this example, a conventional productivist agricultural produc-

    tion system is connected to a hierarchical and formalized vertical

    value chain in which agricultural producers are either part of

    large agribusiness companies (e.g., input-supply companies, re-

    tailers, processors) or conform to their standards (food system

    type 1 in Fig. 4 may be classified as a dominant food system). At

    the other side of the spectrum, agroecological production sys-

    tems may be either supported by shared-governed or democratic

    and territorially embedded value chains, which coordinate pro-

    duction and distribution activities on the basis of community

    relations and trust between producers and consumers (Sonnino

    and Marsden 2006). This can be the case of food systems that

    develop in niches supported by grassroot movements and social

    groups (food system type 4 in Fig. 4 can be classified as a niche

    food system).

    Depending on how a food system is configured, perfor-

    mance in terms of satisfying food security and nutrition, en-

    vironmental security, and social welfare varies. A food system

    contributes to food security and nutrition when it is able to

    provide consumers with sufficient, safe, and nutritious food.

    The contribution of a food system to environmental security

    involves the maintenance or enhancement of physical stocks

    of natural capital (e.g., land, soil, water, and biological re-

    sources) and the provision of ecosystem services (Kumar

    2012). Social and economic outcomes of a food system, de-

    noted as social welfare, encompass how the food system and

    its activities support livelihoods more broadly. Hence, social

    welfare performance may include, among others, sufficient

    income for every food system actor (farmers and processors,

    retailers), which requires a fair distribution of the benefits

    (FAO 2014a); autonomy and empowerment of food system

    actors and the communities in which the system is embedded;

    employment and fair labor conditions; and maintained and

    enhanced social capital (Ericksen 2008; FAO 2014a).

    Environmental security outcomes and social welfare out-

    comes co-determine food security and nutrition (Ericksen

    2008). In the example of Fig. 4, food system type 1 may

    perform well in terms of economic outcomes and poorly in

    environmental and social welfare, whereas food system type 4

    may emphasize environmental security and social welfare at

    the expense of economic outcomes.

    3 Methodological approach

    for implementation of the framework

    We propose a seven-step procedure to characterize food sys-

    tems and classify them as dominant food systems, niche food

    systems, or hybrid forms (Table 1). Each of the seven steps

    1

    Page 8 of 22

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    requires hybridizing methods of analysis and techniques of

    data collection. In the ideal case, implementation of the steps

    should combine diverse methods and techniques to generate

    both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data pro-

    vides the basis for the identification and description of agri-

    cultural production systems, value chains, and the support

    structures. Quantitative data provides the descriptive statistics

    and trends to complement the information gathered through

    the qualitative approaches (Schut et al. 2015). Combining dif-

    ferent types of methods and data collection techniques works

    to enhance the credibility and strength of the analysis (Schut

    et al. 2015) and ensure corroboration, triangulation, and vali-

    dation of data (Sandelowski 2000). The actual selection of the

    methods and techniques to be used depends on the available

    (economic and human) resources and time. In case of low

    availability of resources, a solely qualitative approach is suf-

    ficient if it is able to target different stakeholders individually

    and/or in groups across different levels with broad knowledge

    and expertise on the food systems under study. The objective

    of each of the seven steps and the associated methods and

    techniques are summarized below.

    3.1 Step 1: identifying the food system and defining

    the system boundaries

    In this first step the boundaries and the level of detail of the

    study are defined. The boundaries may delimit the food sys-

    tem for a particular food commodity (e.g., tomato, all fruits,

    and vegetables) and/or for a specific geographic area (e.g.,

    region or country). The food system regime and the dominant

    food systems, niche food systems, and hybrid forms are de-

    fined within these boundaries. Anything outside the bound-

    aries is, by definition, considered part of the exogenous socio-

    technical landscape within the multi-level perspective

    (Avelino 2017). This step determines the scope of the study

    and is therefore closely linked to the nature of the problem that

    is to be analyzed (Neshiem et al. 2015). When identifying the

    boundaries and the level of detail of the study, it is also fun-

    damental to take questions of political economy into account

    and, in doing so, identify dynamics such as gender, class,

    power, and access to resources.

    Food systems may be connected to socio-technical regimes

    outside of their ostensible boundary (e.g., health, tourism, and

    Fig. 4 Example of co-existing food systems. Food systems result from

    the interrelation between (i) a type of the multiple agricultural production

    systems exemplified by the level of ecological intensification and the

    attainable productivity on a per hectare basis (adapted from Tittonell

    et al. 2016) (number 1), (ii) a type of the multiple value chain(s) that

    are exemplified based on the level of trust and commitment towards the

    chain and the power asymmetry between value chain actors (adapted

    from Duncan and Pascucci 2017) (number 2), and (iii) a setup of

    structures for support of innovation and everyday functioning of the

    agricultural production system and the associated value chain (number

    3). Final outcomes of the food systems include food security and

    nutrition, environmental security, and social welfare (number 4). The

    food systems and their components are individually and jointly

    influenced by the socio-technical landscape (number 5)

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    Page 9 of 22

    energy sector). This diffuse or context-dependent nature of the

    boundaries makes defining and delineating the food system

    regime and the food systems not straightforward. Therefore,

    the initial choice of boundaries should be revisited and adjust-

    ed as an inherent part of the implementation of the framework.

    3.2 Step 2: identifying agricultural production system

    types

    This step consists of setting up agricultural production system

    typologies. Although agricultural production systems are dy-

    namic, production system typologies can give snapshots of

    farm diversity at certain moments in time (Alvarez et al.

    2014). Production system typologies can be grouped into

    two main classes (Alvarez et al. 2014). Structural typologies,

    which are based mainly on variables that describe resources

    and asset levels, include variables such as area, number of

    cattle, hired and family labor, and available irrigation water.

    Functional typologies are based on variables that describe

    livelihood strategies and household dynamics such as produc-

    tion orientation and sources of income (Tittonell 2014b in

    Alvarez et al. 2014). The combination of structural and func-

    tional variables would often be needed in the construction of

    agricultural production system typologies.

    To construct structural and functional agricultural produc-

    tion system typologies, various methods may be used, ranging

    from expert-based methods in which agricultural production

    systems are aggregated into clusters defined by local experts,

    key informants, and producers (Alary et al. 2002; Kuivanen

    et al. 2016) to multivariate analysis supported by statistical

    techniques (Alvarez et al. 2014; Pacini et al. 2014).

    Multivariate statistics methods are commonly preferred over

    expert-based approaches due to the structured approach for

    analysis and greater reproducibility. However, expert-based

    approaches can enhance the relevance of typologies to stake-

    holders. Therefore, using both approaches in a complementary

    way is recommended (Alvarez et al. 2014).

    3.3 Step 3: identifying the types of value chains

    associated to agricultural production system types

    This step consists of identifying and describing the value

    chains that link each of the agricultural production system

    types identified in step 2 to markets and consumers. Value

    chains can be characterized based on their network structure

    and their governance form (Trienekens 2011). Description of

    the network structure involves the identification of the value

    chain actors, including consumers, which are linked to each of

    the agricultural production system types and how they relate

    vertically and horizontally. The value chain structure and its

    link to each agricultural production system type (or its com-

    modity) can be visually represented using value chain map-

    ping (Herr and Muzira 2009). Governance forms in vertical

    and horizontal relationships can be elucidated based on trans-

    action costs and value chain and network theory. Following

    Trienekens et al. (2018), three elements in value chain gover-

    nance can be distinguished. First, bilateral contracts through-

    out the chain and their coordination mechanisms on price,

    volume, time of delivery, and quality. Quality is described

    by intrinsic product attributes such as color, safety, tenderness

    and taste, and extrinsic characteristics which cannot be tangi-

    bly measured but that are embedded in conventions of trust,

    tradition, nature, and place (Goodman 2003). Second, the net-

    work governance in which lead parties, shared governance,

    and value chain facilitation are key elements of the gover-

    nance structure. Third, informal coordination mechanisms

    such as trust, reputation, power, and commitment. These three

    value chain governance elements can be operationalized by

    means of qualitative and quantitative indicators.

    3.4 Step 4: identifying the multiple setups of support

    structures

    This step aims at identifying the structures for support of in-

    novation and everyday functioning of agricultural production

    systems and value chains. Main structures of support include

    research and development (R&D), extension services, and

    innovation policies. R&D underpins policies and innovations

    by providing knowledge, data, and novel practices (Wesley

    and Faminow 2014). R&D activities can be undertaken by

    public research institutes and universities, the private sector

    (e.g., agribusiness companies looking for adequate business

    models for sustainable food production), and by public-

    private partnerships. Extension services refer to the set of pub-

    lic and private organizations and institutions that support ag-

    ricultural producers and value chain actors in solving prob-

    lems and obtaining information, skills, and technologies to

    improve the sustainability of their operations. Multiple models

    for extension may exist, including top-down and paternalistic;

    supply-driven; demand-driven, participatory, and pluralistic;

    technology-driven; and gender-sensitive (Wesley and

    Faminow 2014). In our definition of extension services, grass-

    root knowledge-sharing systems are also an important ele-

    ment. These systems refer to alternative and horizontal forms

    of producing, organizing, and exchanging of information.

    Economic and innovation policies refer to the set of policies

    and instruments (e.g., subsidies, fiscal incentives, and policies

    for training and skills) that contribute to innovation in agricul-

    tural production systems and value chains.

    Innovation policies can be divided in (i) mission-oriented

    policies, aimed at providing practical solutions to specific

    sustainability challenges; (ii) intention-oriented policies,

    which concentrate on the R&D; and (iii) system-oriented pol-

    icies, which focus on system-level features, such as the degree

    of interaction between different parts of the food system (ag-

    ricultural production systems and value chain actors).

    Instruments for innovation policy include, among others, fis-

    cal incentives for R&D, direct support to R&D and innova-

    tion, policies for training and skills, polices to support collab-

    oration, innovation network policies, standards, regulations,

    and technology foresight (Edler and Fagerberg 2017).

    To identify the support structures different information

    sources can be used including literature review, multi-

    stakeholder workshops, interviews and surveys with food sys-

    tem actors, and secondary sources (policy documents, project

    reports, laws, curricula for agricultural education and

    training).

    3.5 Step 5: identifying the diversity of food systems

    In this step, the findings from steps 2, 3, and 4 are synthesized

    to characterize the diversity of co-existing food systems. Each

    of the food systems is constituted by the interrelation between

    an agricultural production system type, its associated value

    chain(s), and the encompassing support structures.

    3.6 Step 6: assessing food system outcomes

    This step consists of measuring performance of the multiple

    food systems identified in step 5 in terms of food security and

    nutrition, environmental security, and social welfare.

    Measuring performance of a food system in terms of the three

    food system goals requires operationalization through indica-

    tors. Indicators may be drawn from existing studies and re-

    ports, which can allow for comparability with previous re-

    search. Examples include the set of indicators on healthy diets

    and sustainable food systems developed by the EAT initiative,

    the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and

    the CGIAR Consortium (EAT initiative 2015); the Household

    Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) indicators (Coates

    et al. 2007); and indicators in the Global Nutrition Report

    2015 of the International Food Policy Research Institute

    (IFPRI 2015), the FAO food security indicators (FAO 2017)

    and the Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture

    systems (SAFA) tool (FAO 2014b). The suite of indicators

    should be selected based on the socio-economic and environ-

    mental context to which the framework will be applied.

    3.7 Step 7: classifying food systems through the lens

    of the MLP

    The first six steps of the framework allowed the characteriza-

    tion of the existing diversity of food systems. With the diver-

    sity of food system configurations characterized, the attention

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    Page 11 of 22

    1

    in this step turns to classifying food systems in terms of being

    dominant, niche food systems or hybrid forms. This informa-

    tion can make visible the undervalued and marginalized niche

    and hybrid food systems and can assist and support policy

    makers and stakeholders in the design of strategies to stimu-

    late and induce developments towards a desired sustainability-

    enhancing pathway.

    To classify the food systems as dominant food systems,

    niche food systems, and hybrid systems, the indicator

    market share in terms of sales and production volume is

    proposed as a proxy of the level of alignment of each food

    system to the food system regime. The food systems identified

    in step 5 with the largest market shares and/or production

    volumes are classified as being part of the food system regime,

    thus as dominant food systems. Using these dominant food

    systems as the benchmark, the remaining food systems are

    distinguished based on the level of deviation in organization

    and practices. The larger the deviation is, the more radical the

    food systems are.

    An alternative and complementary tool to classify food sys-

    tems is the typology of organizational relations adapted by

    Duncan and Pascucci (2017) from Grandori and Furnari

    (2008). Following this typology, food systems involving rela-

    tions that are predominantly bureaucratic and/or market-based,

    i.e., food systems with isomorphic organizational relations,

    tend to be aligned to the food system regime. On the other

    hand, food systems that are built around community and dem-

    ocratic relations, i.e., food systems with polymorphic organiza-

    tional relations, tend to provide the space and conditions for

    experimenting with radical practices that are less likely to con-

    form with those facilitated by the food system regime.

    Having presented the methodological approach for imple-

    mentation of the framework, in the next sections we provide an

    illustrative example of how our framework can be operation-

    alized in real life situations (steps 1–7), and we reflect on its

    usefulness, shortcomings, and further development and use.

    4 Illustration to vegetable food systems

    in Chile: lessons from the application

    of the framework

    To illustrate how the framework may be operationalized, we

    present an illustrative example aimed at characterizing the di-

    versity of vegetable food systems in Chile, and analyzing their

    potential to harness production of vegetables with low-or-no

    pesticide use. Chile and its prevailing agro-export development

    model that was started 35 years ago (Ríos-Núñez 2013) is an

    example of how the global corporate-(environmental) food re-

    gime manifests in a country. Government and industry strate-

    gies in food production and commercialization are largely re-

    lying on technical innovation, efficiency, and productivity,

    using the common denominator of sustainable food production.

    Efficiency in the use of natural resources and minimization of

    negative externalities is put forward as the approach to limit

    environmental damage (Martínez-Torres et al. 2017).

    Nowadays, the vegetable sector of the Chilean food system

    regime experiences several socio-technical landscape pressures

    related to the pesticide use: (i) the increasing social concern and

    awareness over the impact of pesticides on the environment

    and on human health (Martínez-Torres et al. 2017); (ii) the

    increasing international prices of chemical pesticides, which

    create uncertainty over the long-term feasibility of the current

    approach of food production; (iii) increasingly informed con-

    sumers demanding healthier food (Martínez-Torres et al. 2017);

    and (iv) government commitments to meet national and inter-

    national targets on pesticide residues in food. As result of these

    pressures, multiple incremental and radical innovations are be-

    ing developed and adopted in food systems. In this example,

    we aimed at characterizing the diversity of co-existing vegeta-

    ble food systems in Chile in order to identify those systems

    with potential to harness production and commercialization of

    vegetables with low-or-no pesticide use. As vegetables in Chile

    are mainly produced for and marketed on the national market

    (ODEPA 2015), the national level was chosen as the study’s

    geographical boundary (step 1 of the framework).

    Drawing on this illustrative example, we reflect on useful-

    ness, shortcomings, and further development and use of the

    framework.

    4.1 Data collection and analysis

    Data to characterize and classify vegetable food system types

    were gathered from June 2017 to August 2017 through 33 semi-

    structured in-depth face-to-face interviews, complemented with

    data gathered from published reports, studies and documents,

    and field observation. The steps of the framework (see Sect. 3)

    were used as guideline for the semi-structured interviews.

    Interviewees were purposely selected as persons with key

    knowledge on of the vegetable sector in Chile, either regionally

    and/or nationally. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded,

    and analyzed with reference to the construction of vegetable

    production system types, value chain types, and setups of sup-

    port structures. Interviewees and their placement on the food

    system component and on the MLP are presented in Table 2.

    Agricultural production system types were constructed fol-

    lowing an expert-based typology (step 2 of the framework).

    As agricultural production systems that are based on ecolog-

    ical intensification (EI), such as organic farming, agroecology,

    and diversified farming systems, have been proposed as prom-

    ising radical sustainability innovations to reduce or eliminate

    pesticide use in food production by making intensive and

    smart use of the natural functionalities of the ecosystems

    (Tittonell et al. 2016), the characterization of vegetable food

    systems was focused on a gradient of EI, ranging from con-

    ventional production systems based on (regulated) pesticide

    1

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    framework). Emphasis was put on those structures that have

    an influence on the use and control of pesticides, e.g., training,

    organic labels, and food safety standards.

    Data gathered for steps 2 to 4 was synthetized to character-

    ize vegetable food system types (step 5 of the framework).

    Once diversity of vegetable food systems in Chile was

    characterized, a preliminary assessment of the outcomes of

    the various food system types was made through a question-

    naire among seven experts with knowledge on the vegetable

    sector in Chile (step 6 of the framework). Stakeholders were

    approached through email and by personal contact. Four of

    the stakeholders were different than the interviewees. We

    asked the stakeholders to evaluate each vegetable food system

    type by providing their degree of agreement on a Likert scale

    with a list of 18 statements. The statements considered the

    three final outcomes of the food system: food security and

    nutrition, environmental security, and social welfare, which

    includes society and economy. The statements were built

    based on the scientific literature on the principles and values

    that underpin a sustainable food system (Bajagai 2014; EAT

    initiative 2015; FAO 2014a, b; Gustafson et al. 2016; IPES-

    Food 2015; IFPRI 2015; Peano et al. 2015). Example state-

    ments for each food system outcome are provided in Table 5.

    Finally, the vegetable food systems were classified as dom-

    inant food systems, niche food systems, and hybrid forms

    using the indicator market share in terms of volume (step 7

    of the framework).

    Results of this illustrative example are part of a diagnostic

    study of the vegetable sector in Chile undertaken within the 4-

    year NWO-funded project HortEco. A more extensive report

    on this example is being prepared for publication (Gaitán-

    Cremaschi et al. 2018).

    4.2 Characterization of vegetable food systems

    in Chile and food system outcomes

    Synthesis of the data gathered for step 2 to step 4 resulted in a

    typology of five vegetable food system types. The character-

    istics of each of the types are described in Table 6. Here, we

    present a summary of these characteristics.

    Type 1—resource-constrained conventional vegetable food

    systems characterized by small-sized production units with

    conventional management using fertilizers and pesticides,

    and some traditional farming practices, resulting in very low

    to medium levels of EI. These systems connect to consumers

    mostly through the traditional marketing channel i.e., farmer,

    intermediaries in wholesale markets, small retailers and con-

    sumers. Due to abundant and largely uncontrolled pesticide

    use food safety is low. Type II—agroecological food systems

    characterized by small-sized production units managed

    agroecologically with occasional use of synthetic pesticides

    and fertilizers, resulting in medium to very high levels of EI.

    Products reach consumers through multiple short marketing

    channels such as local fairs, specialized shops, farmer market-

    ing cooperatives, home delivery, and farm gate sales, or

    through the traditional marketing channel. Food safety is in

    most cases not controlled and relies on proximity relations and

    trust. Type III—locally embedded organic vegetable food

    systems characterized by small- to medium-sized production

    units managed agroecologically, resulting in high to very high

    levels of EI. Certified organic production takes place through

    the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). Farmers market

    the products individually through specialized shops, home

    delivery, and farm gate sales, or in association through PGS

    marketing cooperatives and eco-fairs. Type IV—business-ori-

    ented organic vegetable food systems characterized by

    medium- to large-sized production units managed with com-

    mercial organic pesticides and organic fertilizers, resulting in

    low to medium levels of EI. Organic certification is achieved

    through external certification bodies authorized by the

    Chilean government. Products are mostly distributed through

    supermarket chains and to a lesser extent through specialized

    shops, eco-fairs, and organic markets. Type V—medium-large

    business-oriented conventional food systems characterized by

    medium- to large-sized production units with conventional

    management (synthetic pesticides, mono-cropping, and inten-

    sive tillage), resulting in very low to low levels of EI. At

    medium-sized farms the products are mostly commercialized

    trough the traditional marketing channel. At larger farms prod-

    ucts are mostly commercialized through the agroindustry and

    the retail. Pesticide use is partially monitored by supermarket

    chains, the agroindustry, and governmental bodies.

    Stakeholder assessment of food system outcomes showed

    good performance of vegetable food systems type II and type

    III in social terms (scoring 3.2 and 3.8 out of 5 on the Likert

    scale) and environmental terms (scoring 4.2 and 4.5 out of 5

    on the Likert scale), in line with ambitions of the actors who

    envision more ecological and inclusive systems. Lower per-

    formance was found in terms of food security and nutrition

    (scoring 2.6 and 2.8 out of 5). The stakeholders noted that the

    systems type II and type III provide an insufficient volume of

    vegetables to meet the national demand and that the vegeta-

    bles cannot be purchased everywhere in Chile. Vegetable

    food system type V performed well in terms of food security

    and nutrition (scoring 3.8 out of 5), as well as in economic

    terms (scoring 3.8 out of 5). Built with a predominantly

    economic focus, this food system received low scores on

    environmental and societal outcomes (scoring 1.7 and 2.7

    out of 5). Vegetable food system type IV received medium

    scores for societal outcomes and food security and nutrition

    outcomes (scoring 3.0 out of 5), and received high scores on

    economic benefits (scoring 3.7 out of 5). Vegetable food sys-

    tem type I performed poorly in the three food system

    outcomes.

    The characterization process allowed to identify a preliminary

    typology of vegetable food systems in Chile and the character-

    istics that may harness production and commercialization of

    low-or-no-pesticide vegetables. Each of the five system types

    could be further disaggregated. For example, the medium-large

    business-oriented conventional vegetable food system could be

    further disaggregated into subtypes based on strategies of pesti-

    cide use (e.g., good agricultural practice), and all types could be

    disaggregated based on biophysical setting of the farms or nature

    of contracts.

    A shortcoming of our framework, which is inherent

    to general problems of qualitative as well as quantitative

    typologies, is to aggregate observations into homoge-

    nous juxtaposed compartments. For the case at stake,

    this may hide the fuzzy, partly overlapping spaces

    among the five vegetable food systems.

    4.3 Classification of vegetable food systems in Chile

    Analysis of the indicator market share in terms of volume

    revealed that the vegetable food systems type I and type V in

    Chile can be classified as dominant food systems. These types

    comprise almost 100% of total volume of the vegetable prod-

    ucts that are marketed nationally. It is estimated that the retail

    industry has a share of around 17% of the commercialization of

    vegetables and the traditional marketing channel (especially

    through the wholesale market of Lo Valledor) a share of almost

    83% (Boitano-Contreras 2011; Schwartz et al. 2013). These

    two types are characterized by isomorphic relations, grounded

    in quality standards and requirements set by supermarket

    chains and the agroindustry, and formalized participation rules

    such as entry fees in wholesale markets, and minimum vol-

    umes and qualities. On the other hand, the vegetable food

    system types II, III, and IV together do not reach 1% of total

    volume. Of these three types, type II and type III can be clas-

    sified as niche vegetable food systems. Both systems common-

    ly organize themselves around networks of producers and con-

    sumers (e.g., agroecological communities, associations of eco-

    logical producers, PSG cooperatives, and associations of re-

    sponsible consumers), based on relations of trust, collabora-

    tion, transparency, and equity. These systems respond to pres-

    sures of the socio-technical landscape by promoting the recon-

    nection between production and consumption, giving greater

    attention to local and ecological vegetable production against

    the industrial principles of the Chilean food system regime.

    1

    Page 16 of 22

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    Food system type IV can be classified as a hybrid system

    closely aligned to the food system regime. This system main-

    tains practices and organizational forms supported by the

    Chilean food system regime while it incorporates practices of

    organic agriculture and agroecology such as crop rotations and

    in a few cases diversification, which are stimulated by a grow-

    ing concern for the environmental integrity and the consump-

    tion of “healthy” products. This system promotes the so called

    “corporate greening” focusing on the claim of healthiness of

    vegetables (Ríos-Núñez and Núñez-Yáñez 2016), and seeks to

    tailor organic production to the conventions of industrial agri-

    culture and the industrial market.

    For the case at stake, the indicator market share of total

    volume allowed a locally recognizable classification of vege-

    table food systems as dominant vegetable food systems, niche

    vegetable food systems, and hybrid forms. Nevertheless, it is

    worth noting that depending on the specific socio-economic

    context to which the framework is applied, the information

    provided by these indicators may hide the level of develop-

    ment of niche food systems. For example, in developing coun-

    tries, commercialization of niche food products through mul-

    tiple short circuits is crucial for local development and food

    security. However, the importance of the type of markets that

    are behind these short circuits commonly are absent from the

    official statistics. Therefore, additional indicators to capture

    the level of alignment of food systems to the regime may need

    to be developed.

    Following the national level example described here, re-

    search efforts may be focused on supporting food systems

    types II, III, and IV. A renewed application of the framework

    may elucidate diversity within each of these vegetable food

    system types. Moreover, this preliminary illustration could be

    further developed particularly when it comes to the evaluation

    with actors. The example of Chile has been elaborated on the

    basis of interviews, secondary sources of information, and

    field observations but has not been fed back to the actors.

    Evaluation workshops would contribute to triangulation of

    results and enable their use by stakeholders active in the tran-

    sition to a more sustainable vegetable sector.

    5 Conclusions

    Numerous studies address food system transitions. However,

    an operational approach to map the diversity of food systems to

    reveal patterns of more and less sustainable characteristics is

    still lacking. We proposed a framework developed to serve

    characterization and analysis of the diversity of food systems

    in a defined geographical area (e.g., region or country), and to

    structure thinking about possible changes to the status quo from

    within or outside mainstream food systems. The framework

    enables bringing together information from disparate knowl-

    edge domains in science and practice (such as concepts in

    agronomy, value chain management, innovation systems, food

    system governance, and environmental sciences) to support

    reflection, decision making, and informed discussion on bring-

    ing about changes towards more sustainable ways of food pro-

    duction, marketing, and consumption. Moreover, the frame-

    work allows to structure thinking about how to assess food

    system performance as a basis for informed decision making.

    By distinguishing major structural elements of food systems, it

    may help to bring out developments and alternative food sys-

    tems to dominant ones that, while potentially important to the

    achievement of food system goals, remain invisible in statisti-

    cal data. For example, the results of the illustration were par-

    ticularly useful to identify vegetable food systems that are not

    well distinguishable in market and volume statistics, but may

    have potential for instigating change. Implementation of the

    framework can be deepened by social network analysis to iden-

    tify the role of change agents and actors in the development and

    adoption of sustainable innovations in food systems.

    Although the characterization process simplifies the com-

    plexity of food systems, results of the framework can be used

    to focus attention on functioning of the food system compo-

    nents and reveal main barriers and promising elements.

    Agent-based modeling (Matthews et al. 2007; Utomo et al.

    2018; Van Dam et al. 2012) in combination with design-

    oriented approaches (Ballantyne-Brodie and Telalbasic

    2017) may be used to integrate information and provide lever-

    ages for sustainability transitions. Results of the framework

    can be used in the exploration of potential transition pathways

    of food systems. For this purpose, results can inform the de-

    velopment of socio-technical scenarios, which have been

    widely used to explore consequences of alternative futures

    on transitions, especially in the energy and transport sector

    (e.g., Elzen et al. 2002; Foxon et al. 2010; Foxon 2013;

    Shackley and Green 2007; Verbong and Geels 2010). Rather

    than aiming for prediction of developments from within or

    outside the food system regime, the aim of the scenarios

    would be at exploring the conditions and niche-regime inter-

    actions that are necessary for the realization of different tran-

    sition pathways (see, for example, Geels et al. 2016 for a

    typology of transition pathways). Such information can be

    used strategically to assist and support actors and decision

    makers in the realization of a given desired pathway (see also

    Hebinck et al. 2018).

    Given the multi-functional nature of food systems, a further

    development of the framework could be to include the inter-

    actions between the food system regime and socio-technical

    regimes pertaining to other sectors, e.g., interactions between

    the food system regime and the energy system, health system,

    tourism system socio-technical regimes (Geels 2011; Hassink

    et al. 2013; Pigford et al. 2018; Sutherland et al. 2015a, b). For

    example, the growth and upscaling of radical innovations such

    as those in the vegetable food systems type II and type III of

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2019) 39: 1

    Page 17 of 22

    1

    our illustration would require of coalitions and alliances with

    actors in two (or more) of these socio-technical regimes.

    Finally, a further extension of our framework could include

    a common method for the comparison of the food system

    regime and the diversity of food systems across geographical

    scales (following Fuenfschilling and Binz 2018). For exam-

    ple, a method that affords to look at different countries and

    answer questions such as how does the food regime manifest

    in national food system regimes; what are the existing domi-

    nant systems, niche systems, and hybrid forms in the different

    countries; and what are the shared features of these systems?

    Comparative analysis of food system dynamics in different

    countries may contribute to giving more nuanced views on

    the diversity of sustainability trajectories, following a plea

    by Friedmann (2016) that the debate on food regimes needs

    to be widened.

  analysis: 'The paper focuses on the development of a portable grain mass flow sensor
    to test and determine the accuracy of impact plate-type devices. It employs a

    The paper contributes by addressing the need for a cost-effective and portable
    test rig that can evaluate the performance of mass flow sensors, which is crucial
    for precision agriculture practices.


    The paper provides valuable insights into the use of custom-developed data acquisition

    The paper has high credibility as it presents a novel approach to testing mass
    flow sensors in both laboratory and field conditions, providing a comprehensive

    Get rights and content Abstract A portable grain mass flow sensor test rig was
    built to measure the accuracy of a mass flow sensor with dual use in the field
    as well as in the lab. Concurrently, a synchronization method was developed that
    employs GPS timing data to synchronize the mass flow sensor data with the reference
    scale data. Two-point calibration was compared to multi-point calibration under
    steady-state flow. These tests on mass flow rate of corn with no variation in
    ground slope indicated that a multi-point calibration is preferable to a two-point
    calibration, confirming the results of previous research. The results indicated
    that the accuracy of the mass flow sensor is very good (R2 = 0.99) if it is run
    about the specific flow rate for which it was calibrated. Errors up to 8.2% occurred
    at lower flow rates when the system had been calibrated only at zero and the maximum
    flow rate. The effect of slope on accuracy of the mass flow sensor was investigated
    by inclining the clean grain elevator in two planes simulating pitch and roll.
    A roll of 5° (sideways) did not alter the mass flow sensor zero-point calibration
    and showed no significant effect on accuracy of the mass flow sensor. At 10° pitch,
    the calibration was altered and significantly affected the accuracy of the mass
    flow sensor, especially at lower grain flow rates. Ground slope could have an
    adverse effect on mass flow sensor accuracy; however, the mass flow sensor can
    perform well when calibrated for a given slope. The results with a relatively
    small test rig verify the concept, and show that a larger rig could accurately
    simulate field conditions for mass flow sensors on the biggest combines available.

    monitor accuracyYield monitor errorTest rig 1. Introduction Yield map accuracy
    is important for the successful implementation of precision agriculture. Inaccurate
    yield monitor readings cause errors in the yield maps, which lead to incorrect
    management decisions. The accuracy of yield maps is affected by errors in the
    yield monitor data used to generate the maps, such as GPS coordinates, mass flow
    rate, cutting width, moisture content, and wrong input by the operator (Grisso
    et al., 2002). Quantifying and correcting for such errors will increase the yield
    map accuracy, thus improving management decisions based on yield map interpretation.
    A yield monitoring system consists of several sensors, one of which is the mass
    flow sensor. The mass flow sensor measures the rate of grain flow through the
    combine. Most errors in mass flow sensor data occur when the sensor is operated
    below the flow rate for which it was calibrated, i.e. at “low flow rates.” Yield
    monitors overestimated crop yield by more than 10% in regions of low yield according
    to Perez-Munoz and Colvin (1996). Yield monitor accuracy has been investigated
    since the 1990s. Kormann et al. (1998) tested multiple combine grain yield monitors
    simultaneously on a test stand. They installed three mass flow sensors on a Massey-Ferguson
    38/40 elevator and, in series, placed a second elevator equipped with a CLAAS
    Quantimeter II. They tested the inflow rate from 2.8 to 9.7 kg/s and obtained
    mean calibration errors of less than 3%, with a maximum error of 7% at the lowest
    inflow rate. A laboratory test stand was constructed by Arslan and Colvin (1998)
    to compare the accuracy of a yield monitor to an electronic scale. They showed
    that flow rate change had an impact on yield monitor accuracy. In laboratory tests,
    impact-type mass flow sensor error was found to be 2.1% for constant grain flow
    rates (Arslan and Colvin, 1999). When the flow was varied, the yield data had
    considerable fluctuations resulting in larger errors. According to Al-Mahasneh
    and Colvin (2000), the most reliable method of determining accuracy is to compare
    continuous yield monitor data with an independent reference flow rate measurement
    on the same grain flow path. Variation in ground slope can also affect the accuracy
    of the mass flow sensor. Sanaei and Yule (1996) found that increasing slope adversely
    affected the accuracy of the mass flow sensor. The effect of tilting the elevator
    system on mass flow sensor accuracy was investigated by Kormann et al. (1998).
    Using two volumetric meters, two impact-type mass flow sensors, and a radiometric
    mass flow sensor, they tilted the system up to 15° forward or backward using a
    test stand with multiple yield monitors on the clean grain elevator. The volumetric
    meters exhibited the highest reaction to tilt influences and the radiometric sensor
    exhibited the lowest reaction. The accuracy of combine yield monitors was observed
    to be significantly affected by variation in hillside conditions with yield monitor
    errors as high as 18.2% when harvesting uphill and 60.7% when harvesting downhill
    on 6–9% slopes (Kettle and Peterson, 1998). Slope sensors can be used to reduce
    the adverse effect of slope variations on yield monitoring accuracy (Colvin and
    Arslan, 2000). Arslan and Colvin (2002) conducted experiments to compare yield
    measurement with an impact-based yield sensor and an electronic scale in adjacent
    harvest strips and on the same grain stream within a combine. They also evaluated
    the combine responses to grain yield changes and the effects of varying ground
    speed on accuracy by creating artificial yield patterns in harvesting strips.
    Their average error in yield estimates was 3.4% at a constant ground speed and
    5.2% at varying speeds. They concluded that both variable yield pattern and variable
    ground speed, which result in variable grain flow, reduces the accuracy of the
    grain yield monitor. Burks et al. (2003) developed a yield monitor test facility
    to test the performance of yield monitors under varying static and dynamic flow
    rates. They showed that the GreenStar® yield monitor sensor had high accuracy
    across a range of constant flow rates ranging from 4 to 21.1 kg/s. However, grain
    stream dynamics, tank vibration, and load cell sensitivity confounded attempts
    to measure instantaneous grain flow at low rates of 1–4 kg/s. Burks et al. (2004)
    later used this yield monitor test facility to evaluate the GreenStar® mass flow
    sensor under dynamically varying inflow rates. The yield sensor accurately followed
    ASAE Draft Standard X578 variable step flow rates, while operating at 20 kg/s,
    but had significant errors for flows above 20 kg/s. The maximum error in accumulated
    mass for the variable step profile was less than 2%, while the average instantaneous
    flow error at the steady state was 4.4%, with a 3.4% standard deviation. It was
    found that transient flow had maximum errors of approximately 5%, while oscillating
    flow had errors around 2.5%. So far, all mass flow sensor accuracy testing has
    been conducted under either of two conditions: in the field (Birrell et al., 1996,
    Kettle and Peterson, 1998, Shearer et al., 1997, Al-Mahasneh and Colvin, 2000,
    Arslan and Colvin, 2002); or in a laboratory (Kormann et al., 1998, Arslan and
    Colvin, 1998, Arslan and Colvin, 1999, Burks et al., 2003, Burks et al., 2004,
    Loghavi and Ehsani, 2004). The field tests have been conducted on combines. The
    advantage is that the grain is at field moisture content. A disadvantage is that
    the tests cannot be replicated due to the inability of providing a constant grain
    flow rate or slope. Conversely, in laboratory test facilities, the advantage is
    that the tests can be replicated for a constant flow rate or at a given slope.
    However, the grain moisture content is usually lower than what would be found
    in the field at harvest. The portable grain mass flow sensor test rig developed
    in this study can replicate tests for a constant flow rate or a given slope and
    can be transported to the field to run tests using freshly harvested grain. In
    addition to improved research opportunities, portability allows the test rig to
    be used on-site for educational programs, such as Extension field days and high
    school agricultural education classes. 2. Objectives The goal of this work was
    to build a low-cost and easily transportable test rig capable of testing and evaluating
    the accuracy of impact plate type grain mass flow sensors and which can accommodate
    an elevator support fixture that can be tilted. The test rig can be used as a
    teaching tool at farm shows, extension meetings, and workshops to visually enhance
    the understanding of the principles of yield monitoring systems. The specific
    objectives of this research were as follows: • To design and build a portable,
    impact plate type mass flow sensor test rig that can demonstrate how to measure
    the accuracy of a mass flow sensor. • To develop a data collection technique utilizing
    a synchronization method that employs GPS timing data to synchronize the mass
    flow sensor data with the reference scale data. • To use the test rig to evaluate
    an AGCO Fieldstar® yield monitor, year 2000 model, at steady-state mass flow rates
    of grain. • To use the test rig to study the effect of ground slope on accuracy
    of the mass flow sensor at different mass flow rates of grain under steady-state
    flow by inclining the clean grain elevator in two planes, simulating pitch and
    roll. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Test rig The mechanical components of the
    test rig shown in Fig. 1 include the frame, two-grain bins, an auger-type conveyor
    system, a clean grain elevator, and a hood housing the mass flow rate sensor.
    The frame was made of 51 mm × 76 mm × 5 mm rectangular steel tubing with a load
    capacity of 1000 kg and rides on four pneumatic tires. Identical aluminum bins,
    a supply bin and a receiving bin, were capable of holding approximately 0.76 m3
    of grain. An auger under the bins conveyed grain from either bin to the grain
    elevator. A 12 cm wide rectangular gate at the bottom of the bin wall (Fig. 1)
    allowed grain to flow from the bin into the auger. The slope of the sides and
    bottom of the bins was greater than 27°, the grain angle of repose. Download :

    flow through the portable test rig, the pitch and roll of the clean grain elevator,
    and the location of the data acquisition components. To vary the grain flow rate,
    a lever was used to adjust the height of the rectangular gate from 0 to 14 cm.
    A graduated scale was installed to indicate the height of gate. Tests were conducted
    to establish a calibration curve relating the flow rate to the gate height. The
    system transferred grain from the supply bin to the clean grain elevator and then
    to the receiving bin. The receiving bin was installed on a scale which measured
    the actual weight of the grain. The receiving bin and scale will be referred to
    as the reference system. The scale consisted of three load cells manufactured
    by Mettler Toledo® (Columbus, OH), each with a load capacity of 5570 N. The load
    cells were located such that the center of gravity of the bin provides equal forces
    on the load cells. A load cell transmitter provided a stable 10-V DC excitation
    voltage to the load cells with line length compensation. The load cell outputs
    were displayed on a Mettler Toledo Linex® indicator (model no. 0958) which provided
    an RS232 output of the weight. The actual weight was recorded on a flashcard memory
    device on a single board computer. The auger conveyor system consists of a 13-cm
    diameter auger with a 14-cm pitch, 1.22 m of auger housing, and a 0.92 m rotating
    sleeve. The auger was driven by a 0.37 kW variable speed DC electric motor. The
    top of the auger housing was made of 3 mm polycarbonate plate for visibility.
    The mass flow rate through the system could be varied from 0 to about 5.40 kg/s
    based on the assumption of a small-sized combine. The simulated elevator speed,
    ground speed, and mass flow rates are typical values encountered in corn harvesting
    using relatively small combines. Flow rates higher than 5.40 kg/s would require
    the use of either larger grain bins, which would add to the weight and size of
    the test rig, or shorter data collection time. The 5.40 kg/s mass flow rate is
    relatively low for large combines, which might commonly operate at rates as high
    as 20 kg/s in high yielding corn. However, it is sufficient to check the effect
    of low mass flow on the accuracy of a mass flow sensor. Therefore, one of the
    limitations of the test rig is that it is not capable of testing the typical mass
    flow rates for large size combines. Another limitation is that the duration of
    the test is limited to the capacity of the grain supply bin. In this study, just
    one brand of mass flow sensor, an AGCO Fieldstar®, was tested for accuracy because
    the aim was to validate the concept and capabilities of a smaller-scale, portable
    test rig rather than to compare different brands of mass flow sensors. A clean
    grain elevator from a John Deere 7700 combine was used. The clean grain elevator
    has the capability of pitch and roll of 10° in either direction. Ground slope
    is often described in terms of “pitch,” motion in the y–z plane, and “roll,” motion
    in the x–z plane (Fig. 1). No rotation occurs around the z-axis. The grain hood
    at the top of the original elevator was replaced with a clear polycarbonate hood,
    allowing observation of the grain flow hitting the impact plate sensors. The grain
    moisture sensor (AGCO Fieldstar®) was installed on the bottom of the auger conveyor
    system and secured by screwing the ground strap of a steel clamp to the auger
    housing. This location maintained the best constant contact between the moisture
    sensor plates and the grain flow to the impact plate sensor. Corn was the grain
    chosen for the tests. Only corn was used because there was no intent to evaluate
    the effect of grain type on accuracy. The mass flow rate sensor of the AGCO Fieldstar®
    yield monitoring system was evaluated in this study. The AGCO Fieldstar® yield
    monitoring system employs five sensors: an impact-type mass flow sensor, a moisture
    sensor, a clean grain elevator speed sensor, a header height sensor, and a ground
    speed sensor. They were all installed on the test rig. Since the test rig was
    stationary during the tests, a pulse generator was used to simulate the combine
    ground speed. The impact-type mass flow sensor was mounted on top of the clean
    grain elevator. It measured the mass flow rate of grain flowing from the supply
    bin to the receiving bin. A DataTouch® terminal received the data from all the
    sensors, calculated, and displayed instantaneous and cumulative yield. This terminal
    had a built-in PCMCIA card slot to store mass flow rate data along with location
    and other yield-related data, which was then transferred to a laptop computer.
    3.1.1. Data collection technique A data synchronization technique was developed
    to compare the mass flow sensor data to the reference scale system data. The time
    data from a GPS receiver was used to synchronize the data from the two sources.
    The NEMA data string output from a GPS receiver (Trimble AgGPS 132, Sunnyvale,
    CA) was split; one string of data was fed into the DataTouch® terminal and the
    other was fed into the data acquisition system of the reference scale system.
    The mass flow rate was recorded and stored in a 2 MB PCMCIA card on the DataTouch®
    terminal. The data acquisition system of the reference scale system consisted
    of a FlashCore-B single board computer (Tern Inc., Davis, CA). The single board
    computer has a 40 MHz CPU, two RS232 communication ports, and is able to store
    up to 2 GB of data on a storage CompactFlash card. A C program was written for
    the single board computer to store the reference bin weight and GPS data on the
    flashcard. The data acquisition system of the reference scale system recorded
    the reference bin weight only when it received the GPS data string which in this
    case was every second. The weight data were tagged to the DGPS data. In all, two
    sets of data were recorded; the mass flow sensor data which were stored on the
    PCMCIA and the reference bin weight which were stored on the flashcard. The data
    from the PCMCIA card were exported to the laptop computer in text format using
    AGCO''s FieldStar® yield mapping software, firmware version 4.02. The data from
    the flashcard were exported to the laptop computer in a Microsoft Excel format.
    A Visual Basic program in Microsoft Excel combined the mass flow sensor data and
    reference bin weight data using the common GPS time information contained in both
    data sets. In the Excel worksheet, the weight data was shifted-up by two rows
    to compensate for the time difference of approximately 2 s between the mass flow
    data and the weight data. 3.1.2. Calibration The electronic scale on the receiving
    bin was calibrated with a multiple point calibration according to the user manual.
    The bin was loaded with known weights in the appropriate loading range, and their
    values were entered into the scale indicator. The electronic scale was accurate
    within ± 0.05% of the applied load or to ±1 increment division, whichever was
    greater. The mass flow sensor was calibrated according to the two-step method
    in the Fieldstar® yield monitor year 2000 model user''s guide. First, a zero-point
    calibration was performed. The zero point is the value set by the mass flow rate
    sensor when the combine is running but no crop is being harvested. At this time,
    no grain strikes the mass flow rate sensor, but the vibrations from the grain
    auger and elevator drive motors create a reading, called the zero-point reading.
    A warning appears on the user interface indicating that zero-point calibration
    is needed. There is a choice of two modes of zero-point calibration, manual or
    automatic. Automatic zero-point calibration was selected, while ground speed was
    set to zero and the header sensor switch was in the “up” position. The second
    calibration step, automatic yield calibration, was performed by loading the receiving
    bin with specific known weights of corn. The user interface displayed the measured
    weight, which differed from the known weight. It then output a “calibration factor”
    which compensated for this discrepancy. The calibration factor was then entered
    into the user interface when prompted. The moisture sensor was calibrated for
    corn using a standard oven drying method. The corn used throughout the calibration
    and test procedures met USDA grade no. 2 (less than 5% total damaged kernels and
    less than 3% broken corn and foreign material) at average moisture content of
    13.6% dry basis with a 0.1% standard deviation. The test weight of corn was about
    720 kg/m3. After each test run, the corn was run through a rotary sieve to remove
    the broken kernels before returning to the supply bin. 3.1.3. Experimental design
    A series of repeatable tests were conducted under steady-state grain mass flow
    and simulated changes in ground slope. Each test was repeated three times. In
    each replication, the flow cycle was repeated three times. Throughout this paper,
    measurements from the reference scale system were considered true values. The
    term “error” refers to the percent difference of the measured quantities between
    the mass flow sensor and the reference scale system. 3.2. Steady-state flow tests
    To quantify the instantaneous and accumulated mass flow, tests were conducted
    at five percentages of the maximum grain mass flow rate; 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100%.
    The mass flow sensor was calibrated prior to the tests at a grain elevator speed
    of 395 rpm, a simulated ground speed of 5 km/h, and at 0 (zero-point calibration),
    25, 75, and 100% of the maximum flow rate (multi-point calibration). A series
    of steady-state flow tests were also conducted with only two-point calibration
    (0 and 90% of the maximum mass flow rate) to investigate the effect of multi-point
    versus two-point calibration on grain mass flow rate accuracy. The calibration
    was repeated periodically, and no significant calibration drift was observed.
    Preliminary calibration tests showed that the maximum material handling capacity
    of the test rig was about 5.40 kg/s. A calibration was determined for the vertical
    gate height of the supply bin versus mass flow rate; target flow rates of 1.28,
    2.50, 3.80, 4.62 and 5.40 kg/s were achieved with vertical gate heights of 6.0,
    8.5, 10.0, 12.6 and 14.0 cm. Steady-state flow stabilized after about 10 s and
    data logging was initiated. Each test lasted about 60 s. The output from the two
    systems was different; the reference system gave accumulated mass while the mass
    flow sensor gave mass flow rate. To determine the accuracy of the mass flow sensor,
    the output of these two systems needed to be matched. Two methods were used to
    match the output of these two systems. In the first method, the mass flow rate
    of the reference scale system was calculated from the change in the accumulated
    mass per second. This is considered to be the “true” mass flow rate. Mass flow
    rates from the mass flow sensor and the reference system were plotted on the same
    graph. In the second method, the accumulated mass from the mass flow sensor, calculated
    by adding up the amount of grain measured every second, was plotted with the accumulated
    mass of the reference scale system on a second graph. 3.2.1. Steady-state flow
    under simulated ground slope To simulate the ground slope, the grain elevator
    was tilted forward and backward (i.e. pitch) and sideways (i.e. roll). The tests
    were conducted at four percentages of the maximum mass flow rate of 5.40 kg/s:
    25, 50, 75, and 90%. First, the mass flow sensor was calibrated at the target
    flow rates and corresponding calibration factors were determined and adjusted
    for at the user interface. When tilting the grain elevator 10° forward (17.6%
    slope downhill), the zero-point calibration was significantly affected and a warning
    signal indicating “zero calibration needed” was displayed on the DataTouch® terminal.
    This warning was disregarded and tests were conducted at the four target flow
    rates for 60 s. In order to investigate the impact of zero-point calibration on
    the accuracy, automated zero-point calibration was performed while the grain elevator
    was tilted 10° forward. Tilting the grain elevator 10° backward (17.6% slope uphill)
    altered the zero-point calibration, and the warning indicating that “zero-point
    calibration is needed” was displayed on the screen. Two sets of steady-state flow
    tests were conducted at the four target flow rates, one with and one without performing
    automated zero-point calibration. When tilting the elevator 5° forward and then
    5° sideways, the zero-point calibration was not significantly affected and no
    warning signal was displayed. So, the incline tests were conducted with the zero-point
    calibration already performed with the elevator in the upright position. 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Steady-state flow rate The accuracy of the mass flow sensor
    of a Fieldstar® yield monitor in estimating the instantaneous and cumulative mass
    flow of corn was evaluated for flows ranging from 1.28 to 5.40 kg/s. A summary
    of the test results and percentage of error for five flow rates and accumulated
    mass are given in Table 1. The results given for each flow rate are the average
    of all replicated tests. The sensor and scale mass flow rates and average percent
    error of the sensor in measuring the true mass flow rates are presented in two
    columns, one for multi-point calibration (MPC) and the other for two-point calibration
    (2PC). The results show that the accuracy of mass flow sensor has improved significantly
    by implementing the multi-point calibration. Table 1. Summary of the test results

    a The listed mass flow rates are the means of three replications. b The listed
    accumulated masses are the means of three replications. The accuracy of the mass
    flow sensor was very good in measuring the grain flow rate and accumulated mass
    across the range of flows tested as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, respectively. The
    average percent error of the mass flow sensor in measuring the true mass flow
    rate was 3.2%. The maximum error was 8.2% at 2.70 kg/s (not calibrated at this
    flow rate), and the minimum error was 0.2% at the maximum flow rate of 5.40 kg/s.
    Overall, the accumulated accuracy of the system was very good if the mass flow
    sensor was calibrated for the flow rate for which it was running. Download : Download

    the accumulated mass flow rates from the mass flow sensor and the reference scale
    system. The accuracy of the mass flow sensor was slightly better when recording
    the calculated accumulated mass, with an average error of 2.8%, than when recording
    instantaneous mass flow rate. The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.99,
    suggesting a high correlation between the accumulated mass obtained from the mass
    flow sensor and the reference scale system (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Comparison of the accumulated mass from the mass flow sensor and
    the reference scale system. At the maximum flow rate of 5.40 kg/s, the percent
    accumulated error between the mass flow sensor and the reference scale system
    was only 1.3%, while the difference increased to 5.4% at a flow rate of 2.70 kg/s.
    The response of the mass flow rate sensor for accumulated mass was non-linear,
    shown in Fig. 3,which indicated that multi-point calibration is necessary to run
    the system under 3% error across a wide range of flow rates. This type of behavior
    has been noted for impact plate type mass flow sensors (Jasa et al., 2000, Kettle
    and Peterson, 1998). Many companies, such as Ag Leader, recommend using a multi-point
    calibration procedure to overcome this issue. Predicting the mass flow rate using
    only two calibration points, 0 and 100% of maximum mass flow, produced errors
    in the range of 0.2–8.2%. The highest error occurred at 50% of maximum flow. 4.2.
    Varying the ground slope The accuracy of the mass flow sensor in estimating the
    instantaneous mass flow rate of corn with simulated ground slope was measured
    for flow rates of 1.28–4.70 kg/s. Table 2 summarizes the test results and percent
    error for mass flow rates of 25, 50, 75 and 90% of the maximum flow rate when
    the clean grain elevator was tilted 10° forward (17.6% slope downhill). Table

    calibration. MFR, mass flow rate. SFR, scale flow rate. The results given for
    each of the target flow rates is the average of three replications. The overall
    average error (overestimation) of the yield sensor in detecting the true flow
    rate across the simulated range increased from 3.5 to 19.4% when the clean grain
    elevator was tilted from vertical position to 10° forward slope without performing
    any new zero-point calibration. This error decreased to 7.2% when a new zero-point
    calibration was performed at the tilted position. Mass flow rate had a significant
    impact on the sensor error in the simulated ground slope conditions. The mass
    flow sensor error increased from 6.0% at flow rates of 4.92 kg/s to 29.0% at 2.85
    kg/s and 30.7% at 1.30 kg/s. In order to demonstrate the overestimation of mass
    flow rate by the yield sensor in simulated downhill movement (clean grain elevator
    tilted 10° forward), specifically at the lower flow rates (25 and 50% of the maximum),
    corresponding graphs of the mass flow sensor and scale data have been plotted

    the mass flow rate sensor underestimated the true flow rate up to 48.5% at the
    lowest flow rate when the clean grain elevator was tilted backward, simulating
    uphill movement of the grain combine. Again, performing zero-point calibration
    at the tilted position improved the average error of simulated ground slope on
    the mass flow sensor accuracy from 22.3 to 5.0%. These phenomena could be attributed
    to the effects of fluctuating flow stream at low mass flow rates and variation
    in the grain flow trajectory as it leaves the clean grain elevator due to changes
    in field slope. Table 4 summarizes the test results and percent error in estimation
    of different mass flow rates when the clean grain elevator was tilted 5° sideways
    to the right and left (8.75% slope). Table 4. Summary of the test results of comparing

    The results showed that the average mass flow rate sensor error was not changed
    significantly and remained under 4% when the clean grain elevator was tilted either
    right or left. Possibilities for future work with the test rig include evaluating
    the effect of different grain types on accuracy of the mass flow sensor and evaluating
    different brands of yield monitors. Also, its effectiveness as a teaching tool
    can be evaluated. 5. Conclusions Based on the objectives of this study, the following
    conclusions were achieved: • A portable test rig, capable of handling and weighing
    0.76 m3 of corn, was built and used to successfully evaluate the accuracy of the
    mass flow sensor of an AGCO Fieldstar® yield monitoring system at a range of steady-state
    grain flow rates from 0 to 5.40 kg/s. • A new synchronization method was developed
    that used GPS time data to synchronize the mass flow sensor data with the reference
    scale system data. • In tests, using an AGCO Fieldstar® yield monitoring system,
    the accuracy of the mass flow sensor was very good when run at the specific flow
    rate for which it was calibrated. Errors up to 8.2% occurred when the system was
    run at lower flow rates after being calibrated only at zero and the maximum flow
    rate. Results suggest multi-point calibration would be more accurate than two-point
    calibration, confirming the results of previous research. • The simulated effect
    of a combine going downhill or uphill (tilting the grain elevator either 10° forward
    or backward) altered the zero-point calibration of the mass flow sensor and significantly
    affected the accuracy, especially at lower mass flow rates of grain. Changing
    the pitch of the grain elevator forward and backward caused overestimation and
    underestimation of the actual flow rate, respectively; however, the mass flow
    sensor performed with less error when it was recalibrated in the tilted position.
    On the other hand, the simulation of operating on a side slope up to 5° did not
    alter the mass flow sensor zero-point calibration and consequently showed no significant
    effect on accuracy. Acknowledgment The authors thank Mettler Toledo for their

  analysis: This journal article provides an overview of the ways in which RS data
    is currently used to support environmental policy and explores gaps and limitations
    in this process. The article pertains to Point 3.1. Irrigation Management Data
    specifically on the section of different data types collection and use. RS offers
    multiple benefits including, monitoring the state of the environment, assessing
    the necessity of developing policy, mobilizing instruments for implementation,
    controlling and enforcing proper execution, and monitoring and evaluating policy
    effects. One benefit is that RS contributes to the identification of environmental
    problems and policy development. RS has been used to confirm and quantify problems
    and reveal the size and depth of the problem more convincingly than an array of
    ground based sensors could. Other benefits include verifying compliance with environmental
    regulations and laws. This can be used to promote compliance and detect and avoid
    fraud. Some of the limitations of RS include that ground-based sensors may be
    able to initiate problem recognition more quickly than RS, and that the demand
    for RS is dependent on policy and market opportunities. Funding for RS is dependent
    upon the policy cycle, with the best opportunities for funding often coming within
    the policy implementation phase. Policies can create a demand for RS products,
    and the type of work RS is best suited to do can vary greatly along the policy
    cycle (problem recognition, implementation, or enforcement.)

    \ remote sensing; environment; policy; governance \n \n1. Introduction \nRemotely\
    \ sensed earth observation (EO) has revolutionized our understanding of our dynamic\
    \ \nenvironment. The array of remotely sensed EO techniques expanded in the 1970s\
    \ when digital satellite \nborne imagery complemented aerial photography, which\
    \ had been available since the early 20th \ncentury. Today, the number of EO systems\
    \ designed to observe and monitor environmental processes \nis large and continues\
    \ to grow. Government support for this is strong, as many environmental remote\
    \ \nsensing systems are publicly funded, and an increasing number of countries\
    \ invest in  \nEO infrastructure.  \nEnvironmental concern is a major driver for\
    \ the public support to earth observation. The reverse is \ntrue as well; EO stimulates\
    \ environmental awareness and concern. In An Inconvenient Truth, Gore [1] \ndescribes\
    \ how a single image of the earth, taken in December 1968 by a crew member of\
    \ the Apollo 8 \nmission, “exploded into the consciousness of mankind. In fact,\
    \ within two years of this picture being \ntaken, the modern environmental movement\
    \ was born. The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the \nNatural Environmental\
    \ Policy Act, and the first Earth Day all came about within a few years of this\
    \ \npicture being seen for the first time”. \nSatellite borne remote sensing and\
    \ modern environmental policy thus came of age at the same time. \nThe launch\
    \ of the first Landsat satellite in the early 1970s coincided with the development\
    \ of the first \nenvironmental policies, and the subsequently established environmental\
    \ protection agencies created the \ninitial demand for environmental EO products.\
    \ \nFollowing an increase of Landsat applications in the 1970s, in the early 1980s,\
    \ the question was \nraised whether the market could recover the costs of earth\
    \ observation. The Landsat program, which \nwas commercialized in 1982 (a decision\
    \ reversed in 1992 for military reasons) resulted in a fall back of \nthe \nutilization\
    \ \nof \nand \nthe \nnon \nmilitary \nsocietal \nbenefits \nobtained \nfrom \n\
    remote  \nsensing [2]. Since then, the debate has continued between proponents\
    \ of commercialization and those \narguing that the societal benefits of environmental\
    \ EO merit continuing public support. \nCommercialization of environmental EO\
    \ assumes that viable markets exist. The demand for \nenvironmental EO, however,\
    \ depends considerably on policy and market opportunities, and should \nthus be\
    \ considered in the context of societal demand and the policies the EO serves.\
    \ The countries \nrepresented in the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) recognized\
    \ this dependency on societal demand, \nwhile agreeing in February 2005 to develop\
    \ a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). \nThis initiative aims\
    \ to develop the societal benefits of EO in nine specific benefit areas [3,4].\
    \  \nA systematic insight in, and awareness of, how remote sensing may contribute\
    \ to environmental \npolicy can help to enlarge the societal demand for EO applications.\
    \ However, existing reviews of \nenvironmental EO applications are structured\
    \ according to products, techniques, or benefit areas, rather \nthan the function\
    \ they have, with respect to the policy they support. In this paper, we review\
    \ the \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \
    \ \n \n1733 \npotential, actual contribution, and limitations of EO from the perspective\
    \ of their support for \nenvironmental policy. \n2. Environmental Policy \nGood\
    \ governance requires effective and efficient policies. Policies, in turn, require\
    \ information to \nassess the need and urgency to develop policy, to mobilize\
    \ instruments for implementation, to control \nand enforce proper execution, and\
    \ to monitor and evaluate policy effects. Lack of information, which \npreviously\
    \ may have hampered the efficiency and effectiveness of policies, is rapidly overcome,\
    \ while \nemerging information techniques change the practice of environmental\
    \ policy [5]. Hence, given this \nchanging technical arena and our ambition to\
    \ better understand the relation between EO and policy, it \nwould be interesting\
    \ to consider the contribution of remote sensing from a functional perspective;\
    \ in \nother words, how does remote sensing contribute towards enhancing the effectiveness\
    \ and efficiency \nof environmental policies? \nSeveral policy models have sought\
    \ to unravel the policy making process in a number of  \nphases [6]. In this paper,\
    \ we use the policy cycle to review the potential and actual use of remote \n\
    sensing in support of environmental policy.  \nSeveral policy scientists have\
    \ criticized the policy cycle approach. They point out that policy is \nrarely\
    \ the product of an orderly sequence of stages (or steps in the cycle), where\
    \ a problem is defined, \nalternative solutions are analyzed, the best solution\
    \ is selected and implemented by the executive \nbranch, and later evaluated and\
    \ revised accordingly, as if on conveyor belt [7]. Sabatier’s [8] \nassessment\
    \ of the policy cycle heuristic consists of several criticisms, including the\
    \ lack of causal \ndrivers that govern the policy process within and across stages,\
    \ the top-down legalistic bias, and the \nbracketing-out of multiple levels of\
    \ government involved. However, the popularity of the policy cycle \nmetaphor\
    \ continues unabated because it allows us to analyze the complexities of the real\
    \ world [9]. For \nthe purposes of this research, the policy cycle is particularly\
    \ useful because it helps the matching of \ninformation needs and gaps with stages\
    \ in the policy cycle. Thus, the cycle helps with the alignment of \nremote sensing\
    \ information technology with the policies underlying environmental management.\
    \ \nFollowing Esty [5], we divide the policy process into a series of stages—in\
    \ this case, problem \nidentification and the formulation, implementation, control,\
    \ and evaluation of policy (Figure 1). We \nuse this structure to review the function\
    \ of EO in supporting these various parts of the policy cycle, \nwhile surveying\
    \ not only the potential and current use of remote sensing, data gaps, and knowledge\
    \ \ndeficiencies, but also governance questions.  \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n\

    \ a policy cycle. \n \n3. Problem Identification  \nRevenga [10] argues that EO\
    \ has the potential to assess the necessity of developing policy. There \nare\
    \ however, few publicly available documented cases describing how remote sensing\
    \ influenced \nactual policy development. The detection of the ozone hole is probably\
    \ the best documented example \nof EO triggering policy development [11]. Concern\
    \ about the detrimental effect of chlorofluorocarbons \n(CFCs) on the ozone layer\
    \ [12] stimulated the US Congress to commission NASA to develop a sensor \n(TOMS)\
    \ to monitor the state of the ozone layer. The sensor, launched in 1978 on-board\
    \ the NIMBUS \nsatellite, did not report any anomalies until 1986, when NASA confirmed\
    \ (Figure 2) that the deepening \nand enlargement of the size of the ozone hole\
    \ had indeed occurred since the late 1970s [13]. This \nconfirmation, based on\
    \ re-analysis of the TOMS data, responded to a paper one year earlier, which \n\
    woke up the world by reporting a steady decline of spring ozone concentrations\
    \ over one British \nAntarctic Survey research station [14]. In response to these\
    \ findings, the 1987 Montreal Protocol [15] \nprescribed a 50% reduction, and\
    \ four years later, a complete ban on the use of hard CFCs. \nFigure 2. Size and\
    \ depth (Dobson units) of the ozone hole in October of 1979, 1982, and \n1985,\

    \ \n \n         \n \n1735 \nWhat was new in the remote sensing data? After all,\
    \ the British Antarctic Survey reported earlier a \nreduction in spring ozone\
    \ concentration over their Antarctic research station. The remote sensing \nconfirmed\
    \ that this record from a single station was not an anomaly, and revealed the\
    \ size and depth of \nthe hole more convincingly than an entire array of ground\
    \ based sensors could. \nRecognition of environmental problems is frequently confirmed,\
    \ but rarely initiated by earth \nobservation; other sources of information generally\
    \ precede quantification by earth observation. For \nexample, the recent remotely\
    \ sensed detection of increased water turbidity due to dredging (Figure 3) \n\
    in Northern Poyang Lake, China [17], which was followed by a ban on sand mining,\
    \ was preceded by \nreports expressing concern about the impacts of dredging [18,19].\
    \ The findings of Wu et al. [17], \nhowever, which quantified the extent of the\
    \ problem, and which had been communicated to provincial \ngovernment officials\
    \ half a year before the ban, probably placed the issue higher on the  \npolitical\
    \ agenda. \nFigure 3. Water turbidity (blue = clear, white = turbid) and distribution\
    \ of vessels (red \ndots) in Northern Poyang Lake, China (Courtesy Wu Guofeng).\
    \ \n \nApart from these examples, few other sources attribute the formulation\
    \ of environmental policy to \nremote sensing. Presumably, this is because the\
    \ diffuse nature of the process leading to policy \nformulation makes it difficult\
    \ to assess the precise contribution of EO. Remote sensing contributes, \nhowever,\
    \ increasingly to high level influential policy studies. One example is the FAO’s\
    \ global Forest \nResource Assessments [20], which, while based on reports from\
    \ national forest surveys, have a \nseparate remote sensing survey since the 1990s,\
    \ as a complement to the main assessment report. Other \nexamples of policy relevant\
    \ information from EO include the recent assessments of the rate of polar \nsea\
    \ ice cover reduction [21] and the melting of the Arctic [22] and Antarctic ice\
    \ caps and the Third and \nFourth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change [23,24]. Through these \nchannels, remote sensing contributed\
    \ without doubt to the development of policies on climate change \nadaptation\
    \ and mitigation, deforestation, and trade in forest products.  \nIt will be clear\
    \ that earth observation infrastructure and products, such as satellites, imaging\
    \ devices, \nand imagery, are required to enable the support of international\
    \ policies, and there have been various \ninitiatives to assess the needs and\
    \ existing capacity. For example, the second report on the adequacy of \nthe global\
    \ observing systems for climate in support of the UNFCCC [25], which identified\
    \ that climate \nobservation systems were not adequate, led to a stronger commitment\
    \ of governments to address these \ninadequacies and to produce a true global\
    \ climate observing infrastructure.   \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n      \
    \    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n1736 \nThe function of remote sensing in\
    \ this phase can thus be resumed as providing information for \nscrutinizing the\
    \ necessity to address environmental problems. As indicated above, remote sensing\
    \ does \nnot champion in initiating problem recognition. Remote sensing has however,\
    \ unrivalled potential in \nverifying objectively whether problems exist, and\
    \ to assess their extent and magnitude synoptically \nacross a range of scales.\
    \ Additionally, with the gradual construction of the remotely sensed archive,\
    \ \nremote sensing can make assessments over longer time periods than most other\
    \ data collection \ntechniques could.  \n4. Policy Implementation \nCurrent environmental\
    \ policy literature distinguishes between traditional regulatory instruments,\
    \ \nwhere the nation state or a union of states (e.g., European Union) specifies\
    \ the goal to be achieved and \nhow, and new environmental policy instruments\
    \ (so-called NEPIs), which delegate substantial \nregulatory power to non-state\
    \ actors [26]. Here we consider traditional regulatory policy instruments \nincluding,\
    \ for example, (i) legislation specifying the liability for environmental damage,\
    \ (ii) spatial \nplanning, (iii) environmental impact assessment, (iv) financial\
    \ instruments, and (v) disaster risk \nmanagement, all of which are specified\
    \ by state actors or unions of states. How can these policy \ninstruments be supported\
    \ by remote sensing, and what are the strengths and limitations of this support?\
    \ \n4.1. Legislation \nThe implementation of environmental legislation creates\
    \ demand for EO. The ESA website of \nsuccessful EO products [27] describes, for\
    \ example, how a remote sensing company supplies radar \nbased measurement of\
    \ subsidence to assist an oil company to decide how much water to inject to \n\
    counter the downward movement. At first, this might be perceived as a case where\
    \ the demand for EO \nemerges from the private market in the form of an oil company\
    \ contracting the EO industry. The \ndemand for EO, however, emerges because legislation\
    \ stimulates oil companies to avoid subsidence \nrelated damage claims. \nEnvironmental\
    \ legislation and liability for damage stimulate demand for EO also as a result\
    \ of \ndevelopment of corporate environmental policy. The introduction of ISO\
    \ 14001 in 1996 facilitated the \nimplementation of environmental management in\
    \ company operations. This ISO standard allows \ncompanies to certify that they\
    \ conform, and ensure compliance with environmental laws and \nregulations. Remote\
    \ sensing could support implementation of the ISO standards, for example, as \n\
    follows. Most countries use “normal oilfield practice” as a condition for (exploration\
    \ and) production \nconcessions, which implies that the concession holder returns\
    \ the concession in its original condition \n(i.e., before oilfield development\
    \ started) once production ceases. In the 1990s, Shell used remote \nsensing to\
    \ establish the baseline situation for oil and gas development projects in Russia.\
    \ Historic RS \ndata may be used to establish an environmental baseline retrospectively,\
    \ in cases where oilfields are \nbeing abandoned without an available environmental\
    \ baseline that is reliable. Remote sensing \ncontinues to be underused in establishing\
    \ environmental baselines and in supporting corporate \nenvironmental policy.\
    \ \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n\
    1737 \n4.2. Spatial Planning \nWhile GIS is the primary analytical platform for\
    \ spatial planning, remote sensing plays an important \nsubsidiary role. Remote\
    \ sensing (including aerial photography) can supply baseline information for \n\
    land-use and other forms of spatial planning in areas where maps are not available,\
    \ such as in \ndeveloping countries [28]. Remote sensing also fills a gap in areas\
    \ with a mapping record by providing \nthe data to update maps, because planning\
    \ starts with a review of the current situation, which cannot be \nassessed from\
    \ outdated maps. The legal implications of the accuracy of the information used\
    \ in \nplanning might further require currency of information. Comparison with\
    \ historic remote sensing \nimagery is frequently used to analyze environmental\
    \ change to understand those trends requiring \nconsideration from a policy perspective.\
    \ Finally, remote sensing is used as an input for the modelling \nof alternative\
    \ land use options (e.g., agriculture or biological conservation). Hence, remote\
    \ sensing \ncontributes to the improvement of spatial planning in a variety of\
    \ ways.  \n4.3. Environmental Impact Assessment \nEnvironmental impact assessment\
    \ (EIA) is “the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating, and \nmitigating\
    \ biophysical, social, and other effects of development proposals prior to major\
    \ decisions \nbeing taken and commitments made” [29]. Nowadays, EIA is compulsory\
    \ and is included in the \nenvironmental legislation of most countries. Increasingly,\
    \ environmental impacts are considered in \ntheir spatial context, while visually\
    \ assessing the spatial implications and expected impacts of a \nnumber of alternative\
    \ scenarios [30]. EIA in general, and spatially explicit EIA in particular, require\
    \ \nreliable and up to date spatial information, because EIAs consider specific\
    \ and localized development \nactivities, such as the construction of roads or\
    \ the opening of mines, the impact of which varies \nspatially. Remote sensing\
    \ contributes to this, while it allows the updating of the baseline spatial \n\
    information, such as vegetation and land use, to the current status [31].  \n\
    4.4. Financial Instruments \nFinancial policy instruments include subsidies, taxation,\
    \ and direct interventions. In 2010, €43 \nbillion will go, for example, to farmers\
    \ in the European Union as direct income support. Farmers are \neligible to these\
    \ subsidies if they maintain their land in good agricultural and environmental\
    \ condition, \nand comply with standards on public, plant and animal health, and\
    \ animal welfare. Payment eligibility \nis the responsibility of the EU member\
    \ states, for which each country needs an Integrated \nAdministration and Control\
    \ System, including a land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). The LPIS \nprovides\
    \ a unique identifier to each land parcel and its owner (the claimant), and is\
    \ used to register \napplications for the subsidies and payments made. The development,\
    \ update, and revision of the LPIS, \nwhich can be based on existing maps and\
    \ documents from national land registers, is increasingly based \non high resolution\
    \ aerial photography and satellite imagery.  \nThe use of EO in beach nourishment\
    \ [32] is another example of remote sensing supporting the \nimplementation of\
    \ a direct financial intervention in the Netherlands [33]. Beach nourishment aims\
    \ to \nrestore the coastal protection offered by dunes and beaches weakened by\
    \ shore erosion. Airborne laser \naltimetry is used to estimate the volume of\
    \ sand required for beach nourishment by measuring the \nRemote Sensing 2010,\
    \ 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n1738 \nelevation of the\
    \ dry parts of the beach; sonar is used for the underwater parts (Figure 4). This\
    \ \ninformation is used to direct the companies contracted to nourish the beaches.\
    \ Maintenance of coastal \ndefence lines is a task of the central government (Ministry\
    \ of Public Works), which uses a financial \ninstrument to achieve its policy\
    \ objective of improving coastal defence through beach nourishment. \nEO contributes\
    \ to the efficacy and efficiency of achieving this policy, while assessing the\
    \ volume of \nsand required. \nFigure 4. Laser altimetry and sonar bathymetry\
    \ used to measure beach elevation is used to \nestimate the volume of sand required\
    \ to restore the coastal defence function of the beach \n(Courtesy D. van der\
    \ Vlag, [33]). \n \nFinancial instruments also trigger the use of EO in the context\
    \ of the Kyoto protocol, which requires \nreliable and transparent approaches\
    \ for the estimation of carbon stocks and for the emission and \nremoval of greenhouse\
    \ gases from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. The use of remote sensing\
    \ \nhas been advised to support the accounting of carbon credits, while assessing\
    \ carbon stocks, carbon \nsequestration by vegetation [34,35], and the implementation\
    \ of payments under the REDD+ \n(Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and\
    \ Forest Degradation) policy [36], which is currently \nunder discussion. \n4.5.\
    \ Disaster Risk Management \nGiven the spatial, and frequently dynamic nature\
    \ of all aspects of disaster risk (hazard, elements at \nrisk, vulnerability,\
    \ disaster risk, and disasters) and also of the commonly considered phases of\
    \ the \ndisaster cycle (mitigation, preparedness, early warning, response, and\
    \ recovery), remote sensing is \nsuperbly suited to study and monitor disaster\
    \ risk [37]. This, however, does not happen in a policy \ncontext that is always\
    \ equally well established. Hazard and risk assessment are increasingly part of\
    \ \nurban and regional planning policies, with spatial analysis, frequently supported\
    \ by remote sensing \ndata, serving to assess the probability of loss in a given\
    \ area and for given time periods due to \nenvironmental hazards. In particular,\
    \ policies designed to limit losses due to floods or wildfires are \nemployed\
    \ and aided by RS data [38,39]. Remote sensing has also become a critical tool\
    \ for hazard \ntypes that are more difficult to assess, such as seismic hazards.\
    \ By providing detailed information on \nthe hazard’s spatio-temporal characteristics,\
    \ remote sensing not only supports implementation of \npolicies aimed at loss\
    \ reduction, such as requirements for adequate construction standards or no-build\
    \ \nzones, but also for such policies to be defined in detail in the first place.\
    \ \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n\
    1739 \nWhile RS-based response to natural disasters is naturally ad hoc and case-driven,\
    \ a policy \nframework for international support to disaster response based in\
    \ satellite imagery has been developed. \nThe International Charter “Space and\
    \ Major Disasters”, established in 1999, provides for rapid image \nacquisition\
    \ and damage map production, and is widely seen as a successful example of international\
    \ \ncooperation. However, while the Charter operates within the framework of Space\
    \ Law, i.e., the legally \nbinding Outer Space Treaty, and the United Nations’\
    \ non-binding Remote Sensing Principles, it \nemploys a best-effort approach with\
    \ no legal binding, and no liability is assumed for the resulting \nmapping products\
    \ [40].  \n5. Policy Control \n5.1. Policy Enforcement \nRS information is increasingly\
    \ used in policy control, with the purpose of enforcing policy and \npromoting\
    \ compliance to regulations, as well as to detecting and avoiding fraud. Examples\
    \ showing \nthe potential of remote sensing in verifying compliance to regulations\
    \ on an ad hoc basis include \ncontrol on illegal drugs production[41], land use\
    \ impacts on protected areas [42], illegal logging [43], \nand urban sprawl in\
    \ China [44]. More recently, dedicated operational applications have been \ndeveloped\
    \ to control illegal marine fisheries [45] and marine oil spills [46,47]. \n5.2.\
    \ Fraud \nEarth observation is used in environmental policy control in agriculture\
    \ [48]. While the EU, as \nexplained in Section 4.4, subsidizes farmers, its member\
    \ states are obliged to check and report \ncompliance to regulations under the\
    \ EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The EU supports \nindividual member states\
    \ in implementing information systems that combine remote sensing and land \n\
    parcel based information for the purpose of cross checking whether received subsidies\
    \ comply with \nEU regulations. Pedersen [49] gives a detailed description of\
    \ the use of remote sensing in crop subsidy \ncontrol in Denmark. While initially\
    \ developed to detect subsidy fraud, the CAP system has recently \nbeen expanded\
    \ to also include compliance with environmental directives. Remote sensing is\
    \ also used \nto detect fraud related to the Federal Crop Insurance Program set\
    \ up by the US Department of \nAgriculture, which supports farmers in overcoming\
    \ drought risks [50].  \n5.3. Compliance to International Treaties \nIt has been\
    \ recognized since the mid 1990s [51] that EO has the potential to verify compliance\
    \ \ntoward international treaties [52-54], and increasingly, EO is used by governments\
    \ in implementing \ntheir commitments to these treaties, while controlling and\
    \ demonstrating their compliance. Remote \nsensing is also increasingly used by\
    \ treaties to verify compliance of contracting and non-contracting \nparties,\
    \ such as, for example, the treaty to restrict the proliferation of nuclear weapons\
    \ [55]. Remotely \nsensed evidence of non-compliance has been used to mobilize\
    \ signatories of this treaty to increase \npolitical pressure for the enforced\
    \ compliance of non-compliant states.  \nMore recently, interest has increased\
    \ in the application of EO to enforce compliance with \ninternational environmental\
    \ treaties, such as, for example, the Ramsar convention [56]. The application\
    \ \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n\
    1740 \nof remote sensing to enforce compliance with international environmental\
    \ treaties, although \ntechnically feasible, is not straightforward because these\
    \ treaties typically lack a framework to enforce \ncompliance. Although RS alone\
    \ cannot enforce compliance, since countries are sovereign to decide \nwhether\
    \ to react, RS can be used as evidence in the case of non-compliance and in the\
    \ dissemination of \nremote sensing information that reveals lack of enforcement.\
    \ This may increase pressure on  \nnon-compliant parties to improve performance.\
    \ \n5.4. Legal Aspects and Potential of Remote Sensing \nThe use of RS imagery\
    \ as a source of information to support non-compliance or fraud ultimately \n\
    requires admission of the remotely sensed information as evidence in court [57].\
    \ RS data’s \nadmissibility as evidence depends, amongst others factors, on the\
    \ possibility of accurately detecting \nfraud and non-compliance in the imagery.\
    \ The advent of sub-meter resolution satellite imagery greatly \nincreased the\
    \ potential of EO in policy control, as this allows for the accurate detection\
    \ of indicators \nthat are either not, or only poorly, discernable with lower\
    \ resolution imagery. Purdy [57] further \ndiscusses the acceptance of EO as a\
    \ source of evidence and privacy issues as barriers to the use of \nsatellite\
    \ imagery in policy control.  \nThe potential of EO in policy control has long\
    \ been recognized [58] and Purdy [57] concludes that \nthe greatest use of remote\
    \ sensing may lie in the field of compliance and enforcement. It is also our \n\
    impression that remote sensing has a much wider potential for application in policy\
    \ control than has \nbeen realized so far. It remains difficult, however, to assess\
    \ the actual use and potential of this market. \nWhile the use of satellite imagery\
    \ has been prescribed as one of the ways to demonstrate compliance in \ncase of\
    \ EU agricultural policy, and the ESA developed RS techniques which could be employed\
    \ by \nindividual member states, it remains unclear to what extent remote sensing\
    \ is being used for this \npurpose in actual practice. One reason for this could\
    \ be the aforementioned lack of publications \nreporting on the actual use of\
    \ earth observation, but it might also be a deliberate choice, as detailed \n\
    explanations on how RS is used in policy control might trigger control avoidance\
    \ strategies.  \nThe market of EO in control would appear very attractive when\
    \ imagining that this would require \ncontinuous monitoring. It is questionable,\
    \ however, whether continuous monitoring would be required; \nthe rumour that\
    \ remote sensing is used might affect behaviour such that incidental control would\
    \ \nsuffice. No studies so far have been undertaken to assess how detection of\
    \ fraud and non-compliance \nby EO influences behaviour, and we suggest it would\
    \ be interesting to study this. \n6. Policy Evaluation \nThere are two main categories\
    \ of purpose for policy evaluation [59]. The first is to evaluate whether \nthe\
    \ intended goals for which a policy has been designed have been achieved. Related\
    \ to this is the \ndesire to learn whether the chosen policy instruments have\
    \ been effective. The second is to evaluate \nthe impacts of policy other than\
    \ those it was designed (i.e., to assess possible unintended \nconsequences).\
    \  \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n\
    \ \n1741 \n6.1. Evaluating Achievement of Intended Impacts \nTian et al. [60]\
    \ used a time series of remote sensing imagery to confirm whether objectives for\
    \ \nwhich a policy was designed were met, while confirming that the rate of urban\
    \ growth, which was high \nin the period between 1986 and 1999, slowed down after\
    \ government policy aimed to reduce \nexpansion of the urban area into agricultural\
    \ lands. These authors attribute the reported reduction in \nurban expansion to\
    \ this change in policy. \nIn case of the Montreal protocol, it is more difficult,\
    \ based on remotely sensed information alone, to \nattribute the observed stabilization\
    \ of the ozone hole (Figure 5) to policy. It is the congruence of the \nremote\
    \ sensing record and predictions made by process based atmospheric chemistry models,\
    \ which \nstrengthen the confidence that the stabilization is attributable to\
    \ the ban on CFCs.  \nFigure 5. Stabilization of the springtime size (millions\
    \ km2 7 September–13 October) of \nthe Antarctic ozone hole since the middle of\
    \ the 1990s [16]. \n1,970\n1,980\n1,990\n2,000\nYear\n0\n10\n20\n30\nSize ozone\
    \ hole\n \nThe above example indicates that, while remote sensing allows for the\
    \ detection of whether a \nsystem changes as expected, it remains more difficult\
    \ to attribute such change to policy impact. Impact \nanalysis assumes causation,\
    \ the inference of which is complicated when using observational data, as is \n\
    frequently the case in remote sensing studies, rather than data from designed\
    \ experiments. This \nproblem is common in ex post impact evaluation, and a number\
    \ of analytical techniques have been \nproposed to overcome this [61], such as,\
    \ for example, BACI (before-after, control-impact)  \ndesigns [62]. The ability\
    \ to attribute an outcome to the policy designed to achieve this outcome has \n\
    clear societal benefits; it allows the reconsideration and adaptation of the policy\
    \ concerned and we \nsuggest that remote sensing, notwithstanding the above caveat,\
    \ holds far more potential for ex post \npolicy impact assessment than so far\
    \ explored. \n6.2. Evaluating Unintentional Side Effects \nRemote sensing also\
    \ holds the potential for evaluating the unintended side effects that are inherent\
    \ \nto any policy. The dredging in Poyang Lake, for example, started in 2001 as\
    \ a result of a policy to ban \nsand mining on the Yangtze River, following frequent\
    \ accidents between commercial navigation and \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n\
    \          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n1742 \ndredging vessels [63]. This\
    \ policy, which solved the problem of navigation on the Yangtze River, \nresulted\
    \ in increased water turbidity in northern Poyang Lake (Figure 3) as an unintended\
    \ side effect.  \nAnother example is the use of remote sensing to assess the land\
    \ use efficiency and environmental \nside effects of two rural development pathways\
    \ in northern Argentina [64]. The observation that \ngovernment sponsored colonization\
    \ programs were leading to the expansion of low productivity \nagriculture at\
    \ the expense of forest, while increased yields per hectare in areas with large\
    \ market driven \nsoybean farming resulted in enhanced agricultural output on\
    \ a reduced area, led Grau et al. [64] to \nconclude that large scale market driven\
    \ rural development better balanced nature conservation and \nfood production\
    \ by having a significantly higher agricultural land use efficiency and, therefore,\
    \ \nallowing for more land to be retained for nature conservation.  \nMany policy\
    \ driven interventions influence the space where these interventions are implemented.\
    \ \nThe above examples indicate that remote sensing has the potential to evaluate\
    \ such localized policy \nside effects, and as such, to provide for the information\
    \ required to reconsider and eventually  \nadapt policy. \n7. A Review of Policy\
    \ in the Remote Sensing Literature \nWhile reviewing the above, it was noticed\
    \ that most of the examples were published outside the \npeer reviewed literature.\
    \ This raised our interest in the question as to whether, and to what extent,\
    \ peer \nreviewed literature contributes to the debate on the policy support of\
    \ remote sensing. We therefore \nexecuted a literature search for papers on “remote\
    \ sensing OR earth observation AND policy” \npublished from 1991 onwards [65],\
    \ which retrieved 302 peer reviewed papers. The number of remote \nsensing papers\
    \ that refer to policy increased from 1991 to 2007 by 15.3% annually, which is\
    \ \nsignificantly higher (two sample t-test, t = 19.1, d.f. = 16, P < 0.001) than\
    \ the 8.8% growth rate of the \nremote sensing literature as a whole (Figure 6).\
    \  \nFigure 6. Trends in the total number of remote sensing papers (\x01) and\
    \ number of RS \npapers referring to policy (o) published between 1991 and 2007\
    \ as retrieved from  \nISI records. \n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nYear\n1\n\

    \ Figure 6 suggests an increasing interest of the remote sensing community in\
    \ \nthe relation between EO and policy. However, although all papers associated\
    \ policy to remote sensing, \nnot a single of these 302 papers described the actual\
    \ support of EO to a specific policy. Instead, the \nmajority of papers demonstrate\
    \ or claim a potential of EO to support environmental policy. Other \npapers relate\
    \ EO to policy while considering policies to support the EO industry financially\
    \ [66], \npolicies for the acquisition, access, and distribution of remote sensing\
    \ data [4], or policies as an \nexplanatory variable in empirical research. \n\
    8. Discussion  \nOur review revealed that the various phases of environmental\
    \ policy require up-to-date and synoptic \nspatial information, at various spatial\
    \ scales, on the state of the environment and the extent and \nmagnitude of environmental\
    \ and policy impacts over larger areas. Earth observation is ideally suited \n\
    for this, as a large number of variables relevant to environmental policy, but\
    \ by far not all, can be \ndetected remotely. Moreover, remote sensing permits\
    \ repeated and consistent assessment and \nmonitoring of the environment; it allows\
    \ independent control and its quality can be assessed. As such, \nit is a tool\
    \ with some very desirable characteristics for supporting environmental policy.\
    \  \nWhy, given this potential, is remote sensing not used more widely? It has\
    \ been stated frequently that \nremote sensing may address user requirements more\
    \ cost effectively than traditional environmental \ninformation acquisition methods.\
    \ Having the potential to be more cost effective, however, does not \nautomatically\
    \ lead to utilization of remote sensing. It makes a difference whether the technology\
    \ is \nintroduced in an existing or a new market; cost of market development might\
    \ prohibit the opening of \nnew markets, while competition with vested interest\
    \ might frustrate the introduction of remote sensing \nin markets served by more\
    \ traditional data capture methods. In these cases, one might consider [67] \n\
    suggestions to compare the costs and value of the information provided by remote\
    \ sensing to  \nother techniques.  \nApart from cost effectiveness, one also has\
    \ to consider characteristics which determine the user’s \nappreciation of the\
    \ value of the information, such as its accuracy, reliability, consistency, and\
    \ \ntimeliness of delivery. Increasing standards for accuracy, reliability, and\
    \ consistency are important \nfields of remote sensing research, as they increase\
    \ the competitiveness of remote sensing products \nrelative to traditional earth\
    \ and atmosphere based measurements. The importance of timeliness of \ndelivery\
    \ in post hazard assessment has been stressed in drought [68], flood, and other\
    \ hazard impact \nassessments [69]. Timeliness of information delivery is also\
    \ crucial in radar detection of illegal fishing \nboats, as well as illegal oil\
    \ spills, to allow the navy to intercept suspect vessels [45]. \nThe examples\
    \ given in this review confirm the picture that environmental policy creates a\
    \ demand \nfor remote sensing. This has implications for the possibility of financing\
    \ remote sensing applications, \nas the opportunities for funding differ throughout\
    \ the policy cycle. The best opportunities to acquire \nfinancial support are\
    \ within the policy implementation phase, because of the significant budgets \n\
    typically available for policy implementation. Likewise, it should be possible\
    \ to mobilize budgets for \npolicy control from within operational interventions,\
    \ as good governance requires a more proactive \nattitude towards policy enforcement\
    \ and control of fraud. Most examples of the use of EO for policy \nevaluation,\
    \ rather than being intentionally integrated into the implementation of running\
    \ policy, appear \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n         \n \n1744 \nto have been developed by interested researchers. Remote\
    \ sensing, with the caveats given, has great \npotential to evaluate policy, but\
    \ budgets for policy evaluation are typically more difficult to acquire as \n\
    this evaluation tends to be “forgotten” when implementing policy. Evaluation is\
    \ considered an integral \npart of any policy cycle, and it is here that the effectiveness\
    \ of governance could be assessed. \nFinancing from within existing policies is\
    \ not straightforward for the problem identification function of \nEO, as it precedes\
    \ the implementation of policy and the release of the related budgets.  \nConsidering\
    \ the use of EO in a policy context made us realize how policy dependent EO is.\
    \ There is \na potential for policy independent environmental EO applications,\
    \ for example, in precision  \nagriculture [70] and insurances [71-73]. Apart\
    \ from this, there are certainly possibilities for \ncommercialization within\
    \ the context of environmental policies, particularly where budgets are \navailable\
    \ from within operational policy interventions. From a societal perspective, however,\
    \ there is a \nneed for those activities, which are more difficult to link to\
    \ budgets within running policies, such as the \ntimely recognition of problems\
    \ and the critical evaluation of policy outcomes. We suggest that \ngenerous public\
    \ funding should remain available to support those functions of EO which cannot\
    \ be \ncovered from within operational environmental policy interventions. \n\
    In this review, we argue that the societal support for environmental remote sensing\
    \ applications \nrelies strongly on the question of whether remote sensing addresses\
    \ policy relevant issues. This is \nbecause policies largely determine the demand\
    \ for EO products. The major societal benefit EO could \nmake to environmental\
    \ policy is to improve a policy’s effectiveness and efficiency. The review has\
    \ \nshown that remote sensing may contribute to this while supporting the need\
    \ to address environmental \nproblems, to implement interventions to address these\
    \ issues, to control whether policies are executed, \nand to evaluate whether\
    \ such policies influence the system as intended. It is interesting to note that\
    \ \ninitially (in the 1970s and 1980s), remote sensing was used almost exclusively\
    \ to identify problems \nand contribute to the implementation of policy. More\
    \ recently, interest also developed in applying \nremote sensing in policy control\
    \ and evaluation. It is information on these later parts of the policy \ncycle\
    \ which allows remote sensing to assess whether policy is effective. This assessment\
    \ of the \neffectiveness of a policy forms a crucial part of good governance,\
    \ and we suggest that remote sensing \nholds the potential to contribute to governance\
    \ while filling this information gap.  \nInitially, those typically urging for\
    \ policy development, the public and NGOs, had limited access to \nremotely sensed\
    \ information, since the technical expertise required to process satellite imagery\
    \ was \nrestricted to state agencies. The proliferation of freely available satellite\
    \ imagery and image processing \ncapacity has resulted in increased capacity outside\
    \ government. This trend is further stimulated by the \navailability of web-based\
    \ information systems, such as Google Earth and Google Maps, which provide \n\
    users easy access to satellite imagery. Nowadays, researchers, as well as NGOs,\
    \ apply RS to mobilize \nsupport for cases requiring policy development, a process\
    \ which has been called satellite imagery \nactivism [74]. The media play an important\
    \ role here, while distributing remote sensing studies to wide \naudiences. This\
    \ enhances the effectiveness of the remote sensing information, because wider\
    \ \nawareness increases the demand for policy development.  \nOur literature review\
    \ was focused on the specific search within those papers that dealt with earth\
    \ \nobservation and environmental policy. If we turn to the wider policy literature,\
    \ we find stark divisions \nregarding the role of technical information (which\
    \ includes remote sensing) in policy making. Policy \nscholars are divided between\
    \ those who express confidence in the capacity of bureaucratic circles to \nRemote\
    \ Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n1745 \n\
    acquire and use high quality technical information by integrating the talents\
    \ of large numbers of \ntechnical specialists and those who “have frequently concluded\
    \ that such information is often -and, \nperhaps, primarily -used to legitimate\
    \ decisions reached on other grounds, that is, prior to an \nadequate analysis\
    \ of the magnitude of the problem and the probable consequences of alternative\
    \ \npolicies” [6]. For example, in spatial policy making, some assume geo-information\
    \ to be an objective \nand scientifically accurate resource, with the role of\
    \ providing spatially relevant information to rational \ndecision making. Critics\
    \ argue that geo-information and spatial policy do not have an unproblematic,\
    \ \nlinear, and direct relationship [75]. In choosing between policy options,\
    \ political arguments are more \nsalient than scientific arguments. “The question\
    \ is not whether planning will reflect politics, but whose \npolitics it will\
    \ reflect. What values and whose values will planners seek to implement?” [76].\
    \ However, \nthings are gradually changing. Remote sensing is now increasingly\
    \ appearing in scholarly articles by \npolitical scientists—notably the 2009 Nobel\
    \ Prize winner Elinor Ostrom [77], who argues that the \nstudy of complex ecosystems\
    \ requires the conduct of “long-term research programs that use research \nmethods\
    \ that focus at different temporal and spatial scales, such as time series remote\
    \ images, \nrepeated on-the-ground social-ecological surveys of local stakeholders\
    \ and their forests, and \nexperimental laboratory studies.” \nMost papers reviewed\
    \ in our literature search presented remote sensing techniques and claimed \n\
    their potential to support policy. Fewer papers linked to an actual policy, while\
    \ even fewer related to a \nspecific part of the policy cycle. We are not aware\
    \ of any peer reviewed papers analyzing the \ncontribution of remote sensing to\
    \ specific policy. The limited interest in the contribution of EO to \nenvironmental\
    \ policy fits into a picture phrased by Quevauviller [78], who noticed while writing\
    \ about \nR&D research funded by the European Union, that ‘research to support\
    \ any environmental policy \nshould be feeding the policy-making process directly’,\
    \ but that ‘in many instances this is still far from \nbeing the case’. Currently,\
    \ other media, such as the Internet and professional non-peer reviewed \nliterature,\
    \ disseminate experiences with respect to how EO applications support environmental\
    \ policy. \nContinued support for remote sensing depends however, on how well\
    \ the remote sensing community \narticulates and demonstrates the benefits of\
    \ remotely sensed information to the public sake.  \nThe GIS and remote sensing\
    \ academic community have only recently started to conduct  \ncross-disciplinary\
    \ research. Carton’s [79] research in deliberative spatial policy-making practices\
    \ in \nthe Netherlands shows that the use of geo-information can resolve or deepen\
    \ the conflict between \npolicy actors. Moody [80] argues that only part of the\
    \ potential of GIS in policy formulation has been \nreached, and it can be expected\
    \ that more of this potential will be reached as GIS applications are used \n\
    more frequently. We suggest that the academic remote sensing community could deepen\
    \ our insight in \nthe interaction between the EO and its societal context, and\
    \ propose to consider bridging this gap, \nwhile more explicitly stimulating scientific\
    \ debate and research on this interaction.  \nThis paper reviewed the use, potential,\
    \ and limitations of remote sensing in support of \nenvironmental policy. We highlighted\
    \ how the contribution and limitations of remote sensing differ \nbetween the\
    \ various parts of a policy cycle in the anticipation that this insight will enable\
    \  \npolicy-makers to appreciate the policy supporting potential of earth observation\
    \ and the remote sensing \ncommunity to address, more effectively, the opportunities\
    \ offered by environmental policy. \nRemote Sensing 2010, 2 \n \n \n         \

    Get rights and content Abstract This paper describes a new knowledge acquisition
    method using a generic design environment where context-sensitive knowledge is
    used to build specific DSS for rural business. Although standard knowledge acquisition
    methods have been applied in rural business applications, uptake remains low and
    familiar weaknesses such as obsolescence and brittleness apply. We describe a
    decision support system (DSS) building environment where contextual factors relevant
    to the end users are directly taken into consideration. This “end user enabled
    design environment” (EUEDE) engages both domain experts in creating an expert
    knowledge base and business operators/end users (such as farmers) in using this
    knowledge for building their specific DSS. We document the knowledge organisation
    for the problem domain, namely a dairy industry application. This development
    involved a case-study research approach used to explore dairy operational knowledge.
    In this system end users can tailor their decision-making requirements using their
    own judgement to build specific DSSs. In a specific end user’s farming context,
    each specific DSS provides expert suggestions to assist farmers in improving their
    farming practice. The paper also shows the environment’s generic capability. Previous

    applicationDSS process 1. Introduction The knowledge acquisition process generally
    involves problem formulation from the extracted knowledge in the problem domain.
    Gunn et al. [14] discusses existing knowledge acquisition techniques based on
    manual learning, machine learning and logic programming. However, these methods
    suffer from difficulties such as poor understanding of the key issues of knowledge,
    users’ ability to incorporate issues outside their area of expertise and the need
    to engage highly computational techniques for the purpose [14], [25], [30]. Meantime
    rural industry uptake of agricultural DSS is low (e.g. [4], [17], [21]), and end
    user development of DSS is problematic [29]. The problems identified present a
    clear motivation for the development of a straightforward knowledge acquisition
    method for rural businesses. Farmers’ knowledge of local conditions and expert
    knowledge of science and best practice are both required for effective decision
    making, particularly in a context of an industry undergoing rapid changes. Combination
    of knowledge from the both parties is important. Therefore, in this paper, we
    describe an expert-driven knowledge acquisition method for modelling domain knowledge
    relevant to building farm-specific DSS for rural business operators. We called
    the new solution software environment an “end user enabled design environment”
    (EUEDE). EUEDE represents a specific type of design environment where end users
    (the people who will be the primary user of the system) involvement is central.
    Another reason is that our aim is to focus on the end user’s thought processes,
    relevant technology and their own judgement in order to give them active participation
    in their own application development. This design environment enables the farmer
    (end user), to build a specific DSS that assists decision making by reporting
    on the potential production that can be achieved using relevant improvement strategies.
    In addition, the design itself will be able to deal with a range of rapidly changing
    factors in rural business operations (for example as shown in [18]). Previous
    studies reported that low adoption rates are one of the problems associated with
    current DSS usage in rural business domains [4], [17], [21]. These studies identify
    three main reasons that influence the adoption rate of agricultural DSS, namely:
    (1) The developed DSS does not adapt to the rapidly changing situation in farming
    businesses. (2) Many of the DSS modules are developed by researchers with the
    intention of discovering data relationships rather than solving real world and
    practical problems. (3) Researcher or solution developer often uses their theoretical
    knowledge for problem solving rather than using farmers’ practical knowledge for
    problem solving. In addition, Fountas et al. [10] suggests that farmers base their
    problem solving on their unique experience and familiarity with their own farm
    and that because of this, farmers are more likely to utilise information in ways
    not fully understood by researchers or advisors. The factors suggested above indicate
    that there is a need for site-specific, updatable, and reconfigurable systems
    to accommodate changes within the context of each farm. The EUEDE design environment
    discussed in this paper offers a different knowledge acquisition process whereby
    a domain expert can provide up-to-date and generic problem-relevant knowledge
    into the knowledge base. Subsequently, this knowledge base is used for building
    a specific DSS for the rural business operator. The EUEDE aims to allow the business
    operators to reuse and share their knowledge in a specific business context. Previously,
    a problem ontology model using a knowledge acquisition architecture was developed
    in medical informatics [1] which implemented the idea of reuse and sharing concepts.
    Achour’s et al. [1] work was about designing a knowledge acquisition tool in which
    medical experts are enabled to create and maintain a knowledge base. Their solution
    model for knowledge acquisition has not revealed its generic capability for general
    users although it has practical implications in the medical industry. We also
    adopted the idea of creating and reusing knowledge components in designing for
    generic feasibility of knowledge acquisition in EUEDE. Our approach goes further
    though, in facilitating the flexibility to build a specific DSS for decision requirements
    at the end user level. In comparison to expert systems and other conventional
    DSS, our approach aims to present a new ontologically informed architecture, that
    will deal with problems such as systems rigidity, end user subjectivity in the
    context of use, obsolescence, limitations of a single expert source, maintenance
    problems due to requirement for a knowledge engineering intermediary and differences
    in problem solving emphases between end users and designers. IDIOMS [11] is a
    design environment for building intelligent DSS that proposed a solution for the
    above issues. The IDIOMS approach prioritised a constraint-based knowledge representation
    for extracting expert decision-making rules from databases rather than acquiring
    rules qualitatively from human experts. In the knowledge acquisition process of
    EUEDE, an ontological set of expert parameters and rules for decision making is
    identified by domain experts, which is then used to generate the target-relevant
    DSS according to the end users decision-making requirements. Unlike the other
    knowledge acquisition methods in the rural domain such as POSEIDON [14] and decision-tree
    induction [25], EUEDE enables a straightforward knowledge acquisition process
    for the domain experts. In this approach, domain experts identify required knowledge
    components for a scoped problem domain. They specify the decision-making parameters,
    variable factors, instances and their relationships (examples from the dairy case
    are given in Table 2, Table 4). Afterwards, they formulise relationships by defining
    ratios for each potential level of production in each production class and add
    expert suggestions for improvement within each class. These ratios come from known
    industry statistics and science, are stored in the knowledge repository and are
    later used in displaying guidance in the developed specific DSS. Without extensive
    re-engineering, experts can update this knowledge with current or emerging information,
    such as new policies, market requirements or properties from new diet or climate
    science. This provides a further advance in that the terms understood within the
    industry are designed into the ontology rather than interpreted by an intermediary
    and relate directly to its source research and other documentation. The rest of
    the paper is organised in the following manner. The next section (Section 2) describes
    a case of a single system development in the dairy industry, this is used as an
    example and proof of concept to key stakeholders. Section 3, methods and data
    extraction, describes the methods adopted and data collection procedures for the
    EUEDE. Section 4 describes the data collected from expert focus group sessions
    then Section 5 describes how these knowledge components are converted into a generic
    model. Section 6 explains the knowledge acquisition and decision model in the
    developed design environment. Finally, the discussion and summary section (Section
    7) presents a brief summary and justification of the ontology development for
    outlining the knowledge acquisition system within the target problem domain. 2.
    A dairy industry case: the milk protein problem In this section we describe a
    representative rural industry application: the protein level of cows’ milk. Several
    recent research studies have reported on the effect of climate change on rural
    business domains, for instance on Australian milk protein production [16]. Heat
    stress can reduce milk protein [6], but apart from climate-relevant factors, biological
    factors (such as a cow’s health, stage of lactation, body condition and genetics)
    also influence milk protein production [13], [26]. Whilst the three main factors
    affecting milk protein content are nutritional, physiological and genetic factors
    [13], these vary from farm to farm, region to region. Different regional herbage
    and diets results in low concentrations of milk protein especially in Queensland
    and Western Australia [31], and several other factors, including herd management
    practices [32] can affect milk protein levels. Such findings force farmers to
    consider a range of relevant factors in their operational decision making. Industry
    factors relating to pricing and markets also impact on decision making. The Australian
    dairy industry’s deregulation in 2000 resulted in a drastic change [24], such
    that milk factories provided seasonal price incentives based on the constituents
    of milk, in particular, milk protein. Decision-making factors, not only for this
    case, but, we contend, for other rural businesses are thus shaped both by internal
    and externally business-oriented factors. There is a general need to assess the
    production potential impact of these different factors on rural business, but
    also, a specific need to optimise decisions at the farm level. 3. Methods and
    data extraction Following an overview presentation of the proposed design the
    dairy industry stakeholders suggested that milk protein enhancement was a suitable
    test domain. A case-study approach was then used to acquire an in-depth understanding
    from documentation and from dairy experts of the decision-making factors related
    to milk protein production. For initial knowledge acquisition several two hours
    to three hour focus group (focus group method [22]) sessions were held, comprising
    dairy domain experts with different areas of expertise, including dairy extension
    professionals, nutritionists, physiologists, dairy practitioners and dairy researchers.
    Their enthusiastic exchange of ideas helped establish a clear and shared understanding
    of the issues. The experts agreed on six main factors associated with milk protein
    enhancement, namely dry matter intake in feed; feed value; water management; herd
    management; heat stress management and breed management. From these factors, subsequent
    focus group meetings identified a list of decision-making parameters and their
    specific impacts, providing the basis for the EUEDE’s problem ontology. For knowledge
    verification, we used a convergent interviewing technique [7] in which experts
    were asked individually about aspects of the elicited knowledge, until agreement
    was reached. The final knowledge base was verified with other industry experts
    and against documentation. A process flow diagram is given below (in Fig. 1) to
    illustrate our approach to knowledge extraction using qualitative techniques.
    As part of existing literature analysis, a set of internal and external documentation
    was reviewed based on different dairy factors that affect milk protein. Download

    using qualitative data collection techniques. 4. Data findings In this section,
    we will show how the six identified factors apply specifically for milk protein
    enhancement, but we contend that these are also applicable to rural livestock
    production potentials generally, including dairy, beef cattle, sheep, goat, pig,
    and chicken farming industries. We describe the relationships between the inputs
    and the critical factors of milk protein enhancement in dairy operations which
    were identified from the extracted knowledge and supplemented by reference to
    an industry reference manual [8]. 4.1. Influence of different factors The effect
    of the six factors is shown in Table 1. For each factor, participants suggested
    how its optimisation could potentially lift milk protein levels in daily production
    by a specific percentage range. Table 1. Six factors with the potential ranges
    for improvement Influencing factors Parameters with required amount Potential
    gain for milk protein production if the item is deficient (%) Dry matter intake
    DM = 3.5% of body weight (in kg) 0.1–0.2 Feed values NDF = 30% of total diet 0.1–0.3
    CP = 15% of total diet Starch = 25% of total diet Sugar = 6% of total diet Water
    management Daily water = 80 l/cow 0.05–0.2 Herd management Feed frequency = 6
    times/day 0.1–0.7 Heat stress management Temperature–humidity index (THI) >78
    0.1–0.4 Shade area = 5 m2/cow Breed management Major breed = Jersey 0.1–0.5 Experts
    agreed that the amount of dry matter (DM) intake in daily feed is important to
    improving milk protein production. The specific amount is relative to body weight,
    but also depends on other factors such as the cow’s stage of lactation, production
    potential, and amount of feed on offer and feeding types and methods. Individual
    experts suggested nutritional targets, with which others agreed: in this instance,
    experts agreed a target limit of DM intake as 3.5% of a cow’s body weight. Variations
    in a cow’s diet also impacts milk protein levels. Useful estimates of feed quality
    include NDF (neutral detergent fibre), crude protein (CP), starch and sugar levels
    of feed items. Related factors such as feed processing, growing seasons and feeding
    methods also play important roles in feed quality. Rules of thumb were captured
    for these factors e.g. specifying sugar and starch levels as a percentage of the
    total ration. Water management is one of the most dominant factors associated
    with changes in protein levels in milk. A cow requires ≈80 l of water per day
    during summer [8]. In herd management, the stage of lactation also impacts milk
    protein levels. There are considered to be a total of 300 milking days for the
    production of cow’s milk, and rules relating to cow’s body condition score, calving
    pattern and health apply. Minimising heat stress, particularly in summer, is a
    significant management factor. Heat stress impacts are estimated as a temperature–humidity
    index – THI (a mathematical correlation between local temperature and humidity).
    Milk composition may be affected above 78 so various shade and cooling strategies
    were suggested. Finally, genetics also makes a difference: certain breeds produce
    a relatively higher protein percentage. A herd dominated by Jersey cattle for
    example can produce a milk protein percentage gain of up to 0.5%. 5. Generic knowledge
    modelling Rather than use the knowledge base to develop a specific expert system,
    we parameterised the extracted knowledge using a specific ontology-based development
    methodology. We partially utilised an approach for ontology development called
    METHONTOLOGY [9], which advocates the use of a structured informal representation
    to support the ontology development [3]. The scope of ontology development allows
    development of generic and reusable decision-making components that can enable
    the domain experts to outline their decision-making scenarios within a specific
    farming condition. The components of the ontology are summarised in Table 2. Table
    2. Terms used in the problem ontology development Terms used in problem ontology
    development Definitions Parameters Attributes that have input values and help
    determine the factor values Relationships Type of impacts of the parameters on
    the factors. For example, “is-a” means the required level of the parameters will
    be one defined value. “depends on” means the required level of the parameters
    will be a co-relational value Ratios Mathematical figure that defines a rule to
    set the desired level of the parameters value Inputs Current values of the parameters
    which will be entered by the users Required level The desired level of the parameters
    value which is a estimated value from the rules Potentials Potential production
    (or any other parameter) considered achievable by domain experts  Scope The difference
    between the required level and the current level The methodology of the problem
    ontology development involves five phases: knowledge acquisition; conceptualisation,
    evaluation, specification, and implementation. The decision-making parameters
    are identified and documented for the different protein dominant classes/factors
    in the knowledge acquisition phase. In the conceptualisation phase, the relationships
    associated with the decision-making parameters are defined. The evaluation phase
    involves domain experts to refine the reusability options and for verification
    against user requirements. In the specification, a complete knowledge base is
    developed for the problem ontology. The developed ontology is then programmed
    in the implementation phase. Our ontology’s details are specifically scoped to
    the milk protein domain (given by the policy context set for the project), and
    we specify these next. The major parameters however, are held to be generic across
    intensive livestock industries, and the architecture and approach more generally
    lend themselves to application in industries beyond these. In our domain model,
    parameters in any dairy farm are classified into three common instances: animal
    instances including parameters relevant to the cow’s physiological and breed conditions;
    management instances including parameters relevant to local farming conditions;
    and climate instances including parameters relevant to external impacts such as
    heat stress. These parameters are outlined in Table 3. Table 3. Parameter details

    EUEDE system Domain expert activities Farmers/business operators activities •
    Establish a meaningful knowledge base in the adopted problem domain defined by
    domain experts as such extension professionals • Tailor decision-making requirements
    to a farmer’s specific farming situation defined by end users such as farmers
    • Identify specific parameters influencing decision • Allow farmer’s own choice
    of parameters to selection • Specify relationships between the parameters and
    output variable levels • Set up mathematical relationships for estimating required
    level in production to compare with current status • Give farmers more specific
    expert outcomes on their current farming status To model the domain knowledge,
    our focus was to use acquired knowledge components that enable generic reasoning
    in outlining facts for DSS building. In this way, the model can be reused in other
    domains of rural businesses for building this type of system without any intermediary
    requirement. Thus without involvement of an external knowledge engineer, a domain
    expert can be involved in interpreting and understanding the domain knowledge
    before any actual development occurs, the following model, Fig. 2, shows how the
    dairy operational knowledge was modelled for the EUEDE system development. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Generic knowledge model in the EUEDE. Fig.
    3 shows the knowledge base repository where the domain expert can acquire generic
    knowledge components from any intensive livestock business domain. The expert
    can select relevant parameters from the model or potentially add new ones as (for
    example) new science or different feedstuffs become available, and a DSS can then
    be dynamically generated using the range of parameters relevant to the task in
    question. In this figure, the acquired knowledge shows a complete knowledge base
    from the milk protein enhancement domain in the dairy as an example. An end user
    would select the parameters applicable to their own decision making and add farm
    relevant information, such as number of cows and diet details. Fig. 4 shows a
    report generated from this information, indicating specific deficiencies for a
    particular farm, and related further advice and expert information can follow
    (Fig. 5). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Knowledge repository in

    image Fig. 5. Specific outcomes from the developed DSS in EUEDE. 5.1. Rules creation
    The main function here is the development of rules based on heuristic knowledge.
    The process involves simplifying domain knowledge into knowledge components using
    parameters that apply in to defining a farming situation. For example, dry matter
    intake (DM) is a factor that determines milk protein level. We use a bottom-up
    design method, as the decision-making rules need to be resolved first. The following
    is an example of one type of rules generation: For the relationship: is-a Required
    level = Estimated values input by domain experts Where the required values are
    given by the experts  For the relationship: depends-on Required level = ratio*parameter
    Where required level = factors (changeable by domain experts) that determines
    output variable level Ratio is any variable (changeable by domain experts) that
    determines relations (e.g. 4% of body weight) and Parameter is the decision-making
    attribute variable (also changeable by domain experts) In this way, specific farming
    knowledge is converted into a knowledge base for building decision support tools
    since it establishes meaningful relationships between factors and parameters within
    the ontology. This relationship defines the required level of the potential influencing
    factors that have impacts on rural business production. By differentiating between
    the required or optimal status (as outlined by experts) and the current status
    (as entered by farmers), a developed DSS can identify the scope for specific improvements,
    supplemented by expert suggestions and information. This uses the knowledge components
    at a reconfigurable and generic level, allowing them to be reused and shared in
    producing other specific DSS. The decision outcomes are processed in terms of
    conventional IF-THEN rules, for example: Condition 1 If current DM feed level
    >= required DM feed level, Then No scope for DM improvement  Condition 2 If required
    DM feed level > current DM feed level, Then Scope for improvement with potential
    protein enhancement of max 0.2% In such conditions the system will calculate the
    deficient DM amount and make a specific recommendation 6. Knowledge acquisition
    and decision model The aim of the knowledge acquisition approach was to simplify
    rural business domain knowledge into different building-blocks and store it into
    a central knowledge repository so that it could be used for DSS development. Fig.
    6 shows the knowledge acquisition process and associated decision support building.
    Domain experts extract the knowledge components such as business production goals
    and the factors relevant to achieving those. Subsequently, domain experts formulate
    the rules by defining the relationships and ratios among parameters. They also
    record the expert suggestions for each factor for use in reports displayed for
    the developed DSS. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Knowledge acquisition
    and decision process model of EUEDE. To define the decision-making process, Fig.
    6 illustrates the generic decision process model from ‘knowledge components into
    decisions in our proposed system. In the context of Precision Agriculture, Fountas
    et al. [10] describe a general data-flow diagram to characterise farmers’ decision-making
    process in information-intensive practices which was validated for several decision-making
    operations by both university farm managers and commercial farmers. Fountas et
    al.’s [10] data-flow model was based on Skidmore’s [27] methodology for structured
    systems analysis and design for designing IS, while our data-flow model for decision-making
    process was based on a practical decision-making approach outlined in the industry
    best practice handbook [8] for milk protein management, which was used for farmers’
    decision making. In this approach, both knowledge and data inform decision as
    illustrated in Fig. 6. 7. Discussion and summary The objective of this paper was
    to discuss an upgradeable knowledge model of the design environment which offers
    a straightforward method of rural business knowledge acquisition for building
    specific DSS. The paper reported the application of the rural business knowledge
    in the development of a new design environment called EUEDE where the business
    operators get assistance from domain experts in building their specific DSS. For
    instance, the goal was to explore dairy operational knowledge from a dairy expert’s
    perspective since the EUEDE solution environment has been outlined from this knowledge.
    However, operational knowledge from any other rural industries can be used in
    this design environment by upgrading the reusable knowledge model. This facilitates
    a generic knowledge acquisition that is workable in any rural businesses. For
    outlining generic knowledge model, we examined some critical aspects that have
    impacts on the rural business potentials. For example, critical aspects that caused
    decreasing or increasing milk protein level in production from the practitioner’s
    point of view, although many other aspects that could have great impact on protein
    concentrate in milk production were overlooked. The proposed knowledge acquisition
    process in the EUEDE contributes to decision support tool development in rural
    industries by reducing technological constraints that appear as rigid options
    to end users. This is caused by a great range of changing decision requirements
    and the need to use various rules of thumb in the rural sector that often might
    not be suited to traditional DSS design methodologies. The upgradeable provisions
    for the business operators can reduce the contrast between individual farming
    practice and the relevant technological actions. Earlier researches, such as in
    bioinformatics [2], [19], in World Wide Web design [5], [20], [28] and medical
    informatics [1], [12], [23] justified ontology development as an established and
    workable concept in effective knowledge modelling. Unlike other domains, we used
    the ontology development approach as a progressive way to model knowledge from
    the dairy operational domain, which was utilised for developing and delivering
    specific and target-relevant DSS because of its generic capability. Our developed
    ontology framework enables us to differentiate knowledge components from the problem
    domain and conceptualise them in a generic model, so that the relationship between
    the knowledge components could form the rules for decision making. These rules
    can be changed at any time depending on the domain expert’s judgment (decision-making
    rules in terms of heuristic based estimation). This also reduces the complexity
    in mapping of functions to the system components in the developed DSS. In addition,
    as Hyland-Wood et al. [15] suggested, ontology-based development could enhance
    capability of software maintenance. Our proposed system could be easily maintainable
    because users hold options for mapping the knowledge components of system functions
    of the developed DSS. The decision-making aspect of the rural businesses such
    as beef cattle, or sheep industry are very similar with the dairy, because the
    potentials of the production also depends on the similar types of factors relevant
    with animal management or climate. For instance, the decision-making rules associated
    with water supply in the dairy business could be applied to the beef cattle industry
    by changing the required amount of water for beef cattle. Therefore, to adjust
    the EUEDE within the other domain, we can change the name of the parameters, potential
    factors and the rules for decision making. For example, there are six main potential
    factors in dairy for the milk protein enhancement however; there are four main
    potentials for the beef cattle in enhancing the quality of meat (for example,
    breed management, heat stress management, feed management, and feed values). So,
    it is predicted that this EUEDE architecture could be utilised for building the
    DSS applications in beef cattle industry. Acknowledgements We thank Geoff Johnston,

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\
    \ affordable digital data infrastructure;\ntechnology assist in smallholder data\
    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework as a standard [57]. The use of IoT and WSN\
    \ for\nagricultural applications was insigniﬁcant until around 2010 and has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsince then. Hence, we searched for publications in the years 2011–2021.\
    \ Research articles,\nsoftware and data publications, white papers and conference\
    \ proceedings were searched\nand acquired from three citation databases: ACM,\

    \ Next, results were ﬁltered using the exclusion criteria mentioned in Table 1.\
    \ A ﬁrst\nlevel discrimination was based on the paper’s type, followed by title\

    \ technicality, usability and deployment environment.\nSome 53 papers were found\
    \ relevant to our study, of which about 50% were in con-\nference proceedings.\
    \ Further analysis was carried out on these papers to understand the\nhardware\
    \ and technical details. Sensors and nodes used in the work, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, power sources and energy harvesting schemes, micro-controllers and transceivers\n\
    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\
    investigation result of the work is to be communicated soon.\nFunding: This study\

  title: Utilization of Internet of Things and Wireless Sensor Networks for Sustainable
    Smallholder Agriculture
  verbatim_quote1: '"We argued in Section 3 that IoT and WSN can have various applications
    in this broad domain. Monitoring crops, soil and weather at farm-level, continually
    and in (near) real-time with reasonable cost may provide closer insight into possible
    farm investments for improved productivity. Livestock tracking, pest detection,
    farm input application may support decision-making and better farm management
    practice."HoweverUnfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is

    most useful are also those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism
    and other

    physical damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance
    the

    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.
    With proper

    design and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can be made to beneﬁt
    from

    the technology.'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Four areas have been associated by the research community with
    the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture: precision agriculture (PA),
    weather monitoring (WM), pest and animal infestation monitoring (PAIM) and livestock
    management (LM). In preci-

    sion agriculture, work focuses on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other
    farm input

    management actions. PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs
    for optimal

    production. The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation

    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes

    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59, 62, 65, 66, 68, 69, 73, 77, 90,
    99, 103, 108–110]. Moni-

    toring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer application
    and

    promotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67, 75, 87, 98, 101, 111].


    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT
    and

    WSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70, 82, 83, 89, 94,
    105, 112]. Weather

    data by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other variables
    are also in

    play. The correct approach is to integrate with other agro-climatic variables
    [67, 88, 105, 113]. Corresponding agro-meteorological

    data collection infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This
    is mainly

    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced
    data are

    poor [83, 94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may complement
    these

    weather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they can be deployed densely
    to pro-

    duce data of better spatial resolution, and can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously

    at small time intervals. This brings value in agricultural early warning systems.


    The third area in which IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest
    and

    animal infestation monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits
    to

    farmlands are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such
    threats

    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing

    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation
    of

    leave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases. Temperature

    and motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems. IoT and WSN can
    help

    to set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the required precision and
    temporal

    scale [60, 61, 81, 92, 93, 114, 115].


    Livestock management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technolo-

    gy [79, 80, 86, 104, 116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in
    combination

    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is
    mostly an

    income source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary needs. Tracking
    of

    cattle, monitoring animal health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring
    body

    changes can become sensor-based."'

  analysis: This paper introduces an extensive framework called XtremeAugment, which
    provides an easy, reliable, and scalable method for image dataset collection and
    efficient image augmentation. XtremeAugment incorporates hardware dataset augmentation
    (HDA) and object-based augmentation (OBA). HDA involves varying imaging conditions
    and viewpoints during image acquisition to increase the number and diversity of
    natural images. OBA, on the other hand, utilizes instance segmentation masks to
    cut objects from the original scene and paste them onto new backgrounds, providing
    flexibility in augmenting objects individually and controlling overlapping and
    the number of objects in the scene.

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks are highly
    efficient for computer vision tasks using plenty of training data. However, there
    remains a problem of small training datasets. For addressing this problem the
    training pipeline which handles rare object types and an overall lack of training
    data to build well-performing models that provide stable predictions is required.
    This article reports on the comprehensive framework XtremeAugment which provides
    an easy, reliable, and scalable way to collect image datasets and to efficiently
    label and augment collected data. The presented framework consists of two augmentation
    techniques that can be used independently and complement each other when applied
    together. These are Hardware Dataset Augmentation (HDA) and Object-Based Augmentation
    (OBA). HDA allows the users to collect more data and spend less time on manual
    data labeling. OBA significantly increases the training data variability and remains
    the distribution of the augmented images being close to the original dataset.
    We assess the proposed approach for the apple spoil segmentation scenario. Our
    results demonstrate a substantial increase in the model accuracy reaching 0.91
    F1-score and outperforming the baseline model for up to 0.62 F1-score for a few-shot
    learning case in the wild data. The highest benefit of applying XtremeAugment
    is achieved for the cases where we collect images in the controlled indoor environment,
    but have to use the model in the wild. XtremeAugment: The effect of data augmentation

    I. Introduction In recent years deep convolutional neural networks proved to reach
    the state-of-the-art performance on computer vision (CV) tasks such as classification
    [1], semantic segmentation [2], object detection [3], domain adaptation [4], pose
    estimation [5], etc. In comparison with classic CV algorithms, deep learning (DL)
    models are trained rather than programmed [6]. It makes them more flexible for
    different domains and requires less domain-specific knowledge from the developer
    because the model retrieves patterns directly from data. The drawback of DL models
    is that they heavily rely on data and require comprehensive training datasets
    [7]. The more parameters the model has, the more complex features it can learn
    [8], but with sufficient training samples only [9]. Indeed, there are many CV
    related datasets both in the general domain [10] and in specific domains such
    as autonomous vehicles [11], remote sensing [12], medicine [13], precision agriculture
    [14], environmental study [15]. However, datasets cannot cover all the existing
    tasks for every specific problem [16]. Recent research works report that data
    scientists spend up to 80% of time for data preparation [17]. At the same time,
    the number of research papers about data in CV is much lower than the percentage
    of time spent on data in practice (see Figure 1). As expected, we see that this
    gap reduces over time, and one can see the exponential increase in the number
    of research works focused on data in accordance with Web of Science (WoS) [18].
    In general, data-centric computer vision methods are aimed to create the data
    processing pipelines that will increase the overall performance without altering
    the model. In practical problems, pipelines are essential because they serve as
    a bridge between the datasets and models. FIGURE 1. Comparison of the total number
    of papers in CV with the number of papers about data in CV according to WoS. To
    reproduce the result, one can query the number of papers with at least one of
    the following keywords: “computer vision”, “convolutional network”, “pattern recognition”,
    “image”, “CNN”. To get the number of CV papers that focus on data, we propose
    to add at least one “data”, “dataset”, “augmentation”, “collection” obligatory
    keywords to the previous query. Show All The primary goal of the papers that focus
    on dataset preparation is to increase the diversity of training data and improve
    the model generalization. Some works propose the model pre-training methods [19]
    or aim to collect new datasets [16]. Other works present the image augmentation
    techniques [20] or feature-engineering approaches [21]. However, to the best of
    our knowledge, no studies provide the comprehensive pipelines that cover all the
    steps from the image collection and labeling to the image augmentation. In this
    article, we present the XtremeAugment framework that handles and improves both
    image collection and image augmentation for the cases when a data scientist has
    to collect images for the experiment. The article shows the efficiency of the
    framework when applied to the digital agriculture domain. Digital agriculture
    is the technological paradigm which addresses the global hunger problem by improving
    the crop cultivation productivity [22] at all stages from seeding to storing.
    It includes the intelligent plant condition sensing, measuring responses to external
    impacts, treatment optimization, yield prediction, spoiling detection, etc. The
    main limitation of this domain is the insufficient amount of well-annotated data
    [23]. To overcome this issue, we present the XtremeAugment framework. The framework
    consists of two independent parts: the Image Collection System (ICS) and the Object-Based
    Augmentation (OBA) library. The ICS part is designed to be flexible, reliable,
    and easy to use. It is built on a declarative programming paradigm [24] which
    allows its application without the coding skills. The key feature of the ICS is
    the support of the Hardware dataset augmentation (HDA). HDA denotes taking images
    from multiple viewpoints and changing the lighting conditions during imaging to
    increase the number of natural images from the same scene. It is a powerful technique
    to expand the dataset size because all the images collected from the same viewpoint
    and various lighting conditions share the same labeling. It, therefore, requires
    neither additional time to collect the data nor auxiliary manual labeling. OBA
    is the image augmentation approach that exploits the instance segmentation masks
    to cut objects from the original scene and then paste them to the new background
    [25]. It is called object-based because it treats each object individually. This
    approach provides a way to augment objects separately, to explicitly control the
    number of objects in the scene and to manage the overlapping of objects. It is
    important to note that both HDA and OBA can be used separately. Their sequential
    combination forms XtremeAugment. Moreover, OBA does not exclude other generic
    types of augmentations (such as rotation, flip, Gaussian noise, Mixup [20], Cutout
    [26], Mobius transformations [27]) and can use them as building blocks. Accumulating
    the advantages of hardware and software augmentations, XtremeAugment provides
    much more training data and, therefore, ensures better model generalization. The
    main contributions of this paper are: we revise the definition of dataset augmentation
    and extend it with the data collection techniques; we introduce the reliable and
    easy-to-use image collection system (ICS) which supports the hardware dataset
    augmentation (HDA); we study the effectiveness of the object-based augmentation
    (OBA) using the apple rotten segmentation problem as an example; we propose the
    state-of-the-art XtremeAugment algorithm which unites HDA with OBA; we collect
    and share the apples rotting image dataset and the auxiliary backgrounds dataset.
    The code for HDA and OBA is available online. The dataset is available on the
    Kaggle platform.1 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II
    we discuss the state-of-the-art in the area. Section III presents the methodology
    of hardware and object-based image augmentation. The Experimental setup is described
    in details in Section IV. Section V provides the results with the XtremeAugment
    framework. Appendix A explains the general hardware related methodology. Appendix
    B shows the details of the current system implementation. SECTION II. Related
    Work In this section, we overview existing image collection systems and image
    augmentation methods. They are described separately because, before our paper,
    they were not combined into a single framework. A. Image Collection Systems As
    mentioned in the previous section, the data collection process plays a crucial
    role in Data Science. In many domains and cases, dataset collection is not a just
    time-consuming procedure but also is complicated due to the following reasons:
    historical (sequential) data is required for each object; multiple views are required
    (for images/videos/point clouds), or multiple sources of the data are required,
    e.g., camera images and sensor data; conditions changing is required, e.g., light
    conditions or plant treatment; item-specific actuation is required, e.g., plant
    watering. In this paper, we focus on the precision agriculture domain. The specific
    difficulty in plant phenomics is the complex plant structure and rapid variability
    of this structure. Thus, many works are dedicated to datasets or IoT systems for
    digital agriculture [28]. In [29], authors collected a dataset that contains images
    of different plant species cultivated under three different growth conditions
    in a semifield setting. The imaging system mounted on the railing system contains
    a global shutter camera, Xenon ring flash, Nvidia Jetson TX2 based computer, and
    solid-state drive (SSD) storage. Some sensors and actuation were embedded in the
    construction of the setup for automated rain protection. In [30] authors collected
    a large dataset of images of species in greenhouses captured in various conditions.
    Three types of cameras were used in this work: IoT cameras, mobile cameras, and
    smartphone cameras, which are capable of tracking the growth process of a single
    type of crop and a variety of crops. The watering process was automated using
    an autonomous mobile robot, and pinking was also automated using a robot. Images
    are uploaded from devices to cloud servers. In [31] authors propose a dataset
    that contains images of different species at several growth stages acquired with
    comparable light conditions. A camera mounts on a special rig setup. Along with
    the specific construction of the rig, an embedded camera flash was used to achieve
    comparable light conditions, and an external trigger was used to avoid vibrations.
    To track the species, they use a barcode-based system. The work [32] is dedicated
    to the collection of Australian rangelands species dataset for robotic weed control
    application authors used custom data logging device for recording images and Global
    Positioning System (GPS) data. This device consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 board,
    high-resolution Ethernet RGB camera, Arduino board with custom electronics shield,
    GPS receiver with external antenna, and touchscreen display module. All components
    are mounted on a tripod. The work [33] is dedicated to the collection of the dataset
    of Fuji apple trees point clouds for the fruit detection task. The authors used
    a special mobile system that consists of a laser imaging, detection, and ranging
    device (LiDAR), a real-time kinematics global navigation satellite system, and
    an air-assisted sprayer. The dataset was recorded under different views and air-flow
    conditions generated by the sprayer. There is a number of other works that consider
    application of mobile platforms like human-controlled vehicles [34]–[36] and special
    field robots [37]–[40] for recording agricultural datasets in the field. Besides
    RGB cameras, those systems contain RGB-D cameras [34], [39], [40], LiDARs [39],
    thermal and hyperspectral cameras [40]. Digital agriculture is not the only example
    of areas where data collection requires sophisticated systems. One can also mention
    retail industry [41], medicine [42], electrical systems [43], [44], industrial
    manufacturing [45] and many others. One can see that data collection can be challenging.
    In many cases, it is performed manually [46], which requires hundreds of hours
    and much effort. Many papers automate the data collection process, but they have
    to use custom software solutions. Thus, implementing a unified and flexible framework
    that can be reused between different domains and applications can dramatically
    simplify the process of such datasets collection. B. Image Augmentation It is
    important to have training samples that cover cases that the model should be able
    to predict [9]. No model can classify a type of object that was not in the training
    set. Therefore, collecting more training data is always beneficial for model accuracy
    [8]. However, it is not always possible to collect more data [16]. Moreover, in
    practical tasks, regardless of the number of collected samples, it is usually
    possible to generate more samples via image augmentation [47] if there are no
    domain-specific restrictions [48]. Researches show that such architectures as
    generative adversarial networks (GANs) and such training approach as metric learning
    highly rely on image augmentation [49]. Image augmentation is applied from the
    beginning of computer vision. It mainly included generic image transformations
    such as rotation, flipping, color shifting, etc. With the rise of deep learning
    and the dramatic increase of modern models’ capacity, augmentation techniques
    became indispensable in computer vision. Models with many learnable weights require
    more training data to reach an accuracy plateau. Augmentation is also performed
    as a regularizer during the training process [50]. More researches started to
    focus on model training pipelines, but not only model architectures (see Figure
    1), so image augmentation approaches become more advanced. One of the first definitions
    of image augmentation may be stated as is a technique that applies various transformations
    to original images to increase training data variability [51]. The critical point
    is that it was assumed that new samples were obtained from the existing data.
    Now, apart from image augmentations via transformations, we can distinguish new
    sample synthesis and other approaches [52]. In [53], authors use GANs to vary
    training samples. In [54], they used 3D modeling to generate new artificial scenes
    with sweet peppers. Therefore, augmentation is no longer restricted to the processing
    of the original data. In [55] authors show an efficient way to augment data of
    various modalities, including images in latent space. This is another showcase
    where augmentation is applied not to the original dataset. In [56] authors show
    that emitting supplementary green light during data collection is beneficial in
    some plant phenotyping computer vision problems. This technique also can be considered
    image augmentation. Another case when a model is trained not on the collected
    data is the dataset distillation. The training dataset consists of distilled image
    representations rather than original images in this approach [57]. In this paper,
    we use the term dataset augmentation as a general way to describe data manipulations
    used to pre-process data before or during training. According to our definition,
    dataset augmentation is a set of techniques that artificially increase the number
    of data samples used for model training or evaluation. It includes data collection,
    image augmentation, feature space manipulation, and other techniques. Also, note
    that usually, augmentation is used for model training, but some methods can be
    successfully applied for test-time augmentation (TTA). In recent years many new
    image augmentation algorithms have been introduced. In [25], authors propose to
    split them into image-based and object-based augmentations. Image-based approaches
    target whole images. It can be either basic geometrical and color transformations
    or combining multiple images like in Mixup [20]. Object-based augmentations target
    separate objects. They utilize available instance segmentation masks or bounding
    boxes to cut objects from the original images and paste them to a new scene. For
    example, Mixup has an object-based adaptation called CutMix that cuts objects
    by their bounding boxes before pasting them to a new scene [58]. Direct manipulation
    with objects of interest provides more flexibility and enables substituting the
    visual domain [59]. It is an up-and-coming concept, and in this work, we focus
    on it. First object-based augmentations started by modeling the visual context
    around the object of interest. [60]. The authors in [61] stated that it is the
    key to performing augmentation for object detection successfully. However, in
    [25] and [62], authors show that naive cutting and pasting also improve the model
    performance sufficiently. While first papers on object-based augmentation focused
    on single computer tasks like object detection [63] or instance segmentation [62],
    in [25] authors extend this idea to solve many problems such as classification,
    semantic segmentation, object detection, and object counting simultaneously. SECTION
    III. XtremeAugment Methodology Almost all the practical and research computer
    vision problems require image augmentation. Nevertheless, it is vital to understand
    that not all transformations improve the quality of the training set. Having several
    copies of the same image increases the quantity of the available data. However,
    to be helpful for the model training, new samples must differ from the original
    image to add variability, and at the same time, the target object must be recognizable.
    Figure 2 reflects the difference between augmentation approaches. One can see
    that without any augmentation, the training set entirely belongs to the set of
    natural images. It means that these are images that can be obtained if one makes
    some image with a camera. The problem with leaving the training set as it is in
    its small size for most real-world problems. Applying regular augmentation adds
    variability and remains the distribution of the extended set close to the distribution
    of the original one. However, the provided enlargement is not efficient. It is
    particularly crucial for the few-shot learning cases [64]. In contrast, if the
    substantial augmentation is applied, it adds much variability, but many samples
    will differ from the original distribution too much. In [65], authors show that
    it is beneficial when the augmented set aims to match the original one. In [66],
    the authors demonstrate that too strong augmentation makes an object not recognizable,
    and it is better to treat it as a negative training sample. The goal of XtremeAugment
    is to significantly increase the number of training samples and leave augmented
    set distribution closer to the original training set. To achieve this, XtremeAugment
    combines hardware and object-based image augmentations. FIGURE 2. XtremeAugment
    concept. The outer blue oval represents the set of all possible images. The green
    oval in the middle represents the set of all natural images. A small red oval
    represents the original training set. The bigger translucent red oval represents
    the augmented training set obtained with different approaches. Show All FIGURE
    3. Example of a base image and images obtained by different augmentation approaches.
    The number of augmented samples can vary. Baseline data is a single image. HDA
    data is images collected from multiple viewpoints and with different light conditions.
    OBA composes multiple separate objects and adds a new complex background. XtremeAugment
    combines HDA and OBA. Show All A. Hardware Dataset Augmentation Hardware dataset
    augmentation denotes altering natural scene setup during image collection. In
    paper [67], authors show that changing artificial lighting direction is significant
    to improve model performance in greenhouse conditions. In [68], authors report
    that controlling lighting conditions can improve outdoor results as well. We do
    not expect it to be a universal key to boost computer vision, although it looks
    promising for the cases where it is possible to control lighting conditions manually.
    There are many other ways to add variability to original images. We propose to
    use different types of cameras: web cameras, Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras,
    night-vision cameras, multispectral cameras, and other types depending on the
    problem. Another valuable modification is to place multiple cameras to catch the
    scene from different viewpoints simultaneously (Figure 4). FIGURE 4. Multi-view
    data collection example. Show All B. Object-Based Augmentation Object-based augmentations
    use object masks to crop the object of interest from the original image and paste
    it to a new background. Among existing OBA mechanics, as a baseline, we choose
    one reported in [25]. It is a naive solution that does not model the visual context
    on the scene, but it is easy to use and can be effective for many cases. Some
    interesting features of this approach are as follows: the ability to control objects
    overlapping; the ability to control the scene’s orientation; support of the scene
    perspective transform; the ability to generate target masks for multiple computer
    vision problems. This framework allows performing the task that we call Lab2Wild
    adaptation. It means collecting images in a laboratory or some other controlled
    indoor environment and enabling successful model inference in the wild. To achieve
    this, we can combine several cropped objects in a background from the general
    domain or the target domain if possible. The overall idea behind XtremeAugment
    is to use both HDA and OBA (Figure 3). The motivation is as follows. HDA is performed
    during data collection and captures a real scene with various imaging settings.
    It guarantees to add extra information to the dataset and keeps all of the samples
    in the set of natural images. Some viewpoints and light conditions can contribute
    more than others, but no noise is added at this stage. OBA provides more flexibility.
    It adds new backgrounds to the data and augments objects separately. As a result,
    we can get the combinatorial effect by altering backgrounds and replacing objects.
    The core idea with many possible generated scenes is that every step adds variability,
    and we do not need very strong augmentation to have many slightly different training
    samples. The hypothesis that we test further in this paper is that many modest
    transformations can work better than a small number of significant transformations.
    We set the following ranges for the regular augmentations (modest transformations).
    For contrast [0.9, 2.1]; for brightness [0, 60]; for saturation [0.5, 2]. Their
    combinations are also considered. Strong augmentations are outside the aforementioned
    ranges. Examples of image transformations with different intensities are shown
    in Figure 5. FIGURE 5. Example of base augmentations with different intensities.
    Show All SECTION IV. Experimental Setup A. Data Collection To check the performance
    of XtremeAugment, we test it on the apple spoiling segmentation problem. For data
    collection, we use ICS implemented on Raspberry Pi 4 (see Figure 6). FIGURE 6.
    ICS implementation for the apple spoiling segmentation problem. Show All The system
    frame comprises the aluminum beams and has a 1m length, 1m width, and 1.7m height.
    Apples lay on a white tray at the height of approximately 1.3m above the floor.
    We use four web cameras Logitech920c and one SLR camera Canon M50. One web camera
    is placed in the middle top of the frame. Three other web cameras are attached
    at different sides of the frame at the height of 1.5m above the floor. An SLR
    camera is attached at the middle top of the frame. All the cameras are connected
    to the Raspberry Pi via a USB hub. Raspberry Pi also controls lighting. We use
    two light modes for this experiment: LED light from the sides, and from the top.
    The system makes sequential images from all cameras and both lighting conditions.
    For the experiment, we choose four apple varieties with four apples each (see
    Figure 7). The varieties are Golden Delicious, Fuji, Gala, Reinette Simirenko
    (from up to down). Within one variety, every apple has different treatments (from
    left to right): untouched; well washed; damaged; supercooled under −20°C. FIGURE
    7. Top view examples. Show All FIGURE 8. The importance of the correct data splitting
    strategy illustration. Show All An untouched apple serves as a reference for each
    variety. Well washed means the removal of the natural protective wax layer from
    an apple. Damaged apple simulates wrong carriage conditions. Supercooled apple
    simulates wrong storing conditions. The ICS made images every six hours for about
    three weeks. During the experiment, some apples that were spoiled too much were
    removed. To conduct a computer vision experiment, we have to split data into a
    training set, a validation set, and a holdout set. The training set is used to
    update the weights of a model via backpropagation. The validation set is used
    to check the model performance after each training iteration, but it is not used
    for actual training. The holdout set is used after the training process to report
    the final result. This type of split implies that only the training set amount
    of all three sets is used for actual training. Therefore effectively, we have
    less training data than it was collected. It is especially tangible for the problems
    characterized by the small datasets. However, it is required to separate the validation
    set to avoid overfitting and separate the holdout set to check model generalization
    on the unseen data, increasing the reliability of the result. The presence of
    several viewpoints in our collected dataset allows us to split the dataset according
    to that viewpoints. It prevents potential data leakages and also increases the
    reliability of the result. To get a better understanding of the data leakage problem,
    we refer to Figure 8. D denotes the whole dataset. D i is the i th element of
    the set D . N is the number of images in the set D . V (1) denotes the subset
    with viewpoint 1. V (2) denotes the subset with viewpoint 2.d(⋅,⋅) is the distance
    between two images. Here, the distance function measures the semantic dissimilarity
    between the images. In our showcase, it is an abstract function that has a zero
    value between an image and itself and raises according to the semantic differences
    between the compared images. In practice, it can be approximated by the distance
    between embeddings of a metric learning model [69]–[71]. However, we use it only
    to reflect the essence of the data leakage problem and qualitatively compare principal
    approaches to solve it. Note that the presented case dataset contains the time-series
    images of the same objects, and images are sorted by time. Moreover, the apple
    rotting process is one-directional. Considering the irreversibility of apple modifications
    and the stationarity of camera viewpoints, we can state that: d( V (k) i , V (k)
    i )=0 ; d( V (k) i , V (k) j )≠0 , where i≠j ; d( V (k) i , V (m) i )≠0 , where
    k≠m ; d( V (k) i , V (k) i+1 )≤d( V (k) i , V (k) i+2 ) . In our dataset, the
    time between images is short, and cameras are placed far from each other; therefore:
    d( V (k) i , V (k) j )<d( V (k) i , V (m) i ) . We showcase the dataset splitting
    procedure on the example of splitting into two sets: a training subset S (train)
    and a test subset S (test) . Note that S (train) + S (test) =D . The subsets must
    follow a number of major requirements: Training and test subsets must not have
    intersections or very similar cases. Both training and test subsets must cover
    the cases that the model aims to predict. If the first requirement is not satisfied,
    it is impossible to detect the model overfitting. Very similar or precisely the
    same images are not suitable for checking the model generalization. If the second
    requirement is not satisfied, the user cannot expect a model to work on uncovered
    cases. For example, if the training subset has only healthy apples and no rotten
    apples are included, a model would not predict the spoilage. If the test subset
    has no rotten apples, it is impossible to evaluate model performance on the spoiled
    samples. In Figure 8, we consider three principal approaches for dataset splitting
    on a simplified example. The first approach splits the samples from a single viewpoint
    uniformly between training and test sets. To simplify the notation, let the training
    set contain odd elements from V (1) , and the test contains the even elements
    from V (1) . When images are taken often, and the difference between them is negligible,
    this approach violates the first requirement because the distance between the
    training and the test sets is very low d( S (train) i , S (test) i )≈0 . Taking
    images rarely is not a good option as well since extra data is beneficial in tasks
    with complex cases. The second approach assigns the first part of the images from
    viewpoint 1 to the training set and the second half to the test set. In general,
    proportions and the exact split may differ, but the main point is that the subsets
    will uncover chunks of the dataset that can contain unique cases. In terms of
    the distance function, if the overall distance covered in a subset is much less
    than the distance covered by the whole dataset, the split will violate the second
    requirement: d( S (train) min(i) , S (train) max(i) )≪d( D 0 , D N−1 ) and d(
    S (test) min(i) , S (test) max(i) )≪d( D 0 , D N−1 ) . The third approach assigns
    all the data from the first viewpoint to the training subset and the second viewpoint
    to the test subset. It satisfies both the first and the second requirements and
    enlarges the amount of available training data. Beyond this example, more than
    two viewpoints can be used. Certainly, splitting data by viewpoint is not the
    only way to obtain the correct splits. Having different available viewpoints simplifies
    this task. With HDA, a data scientist does not have to manually set a threshold
    of image similarity between the subsets without the risk of improper splitting
    results. As we noted, the proper data splitting is vital to get the correct results,
    but it reduces the training set. The most expensive part of data collection is
    usually manual data labeling. It is demanded to do manual work to get the ground
    truth; in fact, it is labor-intensive. The feature of the HDA augmentation is
    that we collect more data altering the light conditions, but for various lighting,
    the position of the target objects remains the same. In practice, it means that
    we get supplementary images, but we do not have to label them because their masks
    will match. The design of the experiment allows testing different setups of HDA
    and OBA and then unites them into XtremeAugment. To have HDA augmentation options,
    we include or exclude the corresponding parts from the dataset into the training
    subset. To vary OBA augmentation, we change the probability of using it for every
    batch. We mix the natural samples with the generated samples with a predefined
    ratio in OBA experiments. More precisely, we describe the experiments in Table
    1. TABLE 1 Experiments Description. Rows Represent Experiments. Columns Show Which
    Viewpoints or Lighting Conditions are Included in the Training Set. The Validation
    and the Test Set are the Same for All the Experiments B. Apple Segmentation To
    assess the proposed augmentation approach, we apply it in a semantic segmentation
    task. For this task, a convolutional neural network ascribes one of three classes’
    labels for each pixel: damage, healthy, and background. ‘Background’ shows the
    accuracy of the separation of apples from the background. It is important in agricultural
    problems where the background is usually very complex. ‘Healthy’ shows the accuracy
    of finding health regions of apples. ’Damaged’ shows the accuracy of finding cracks
    or rotten regions on apples. The ground truth data is obtained by manual annotation.
    For each pixel, the corresponding class is assigned. For each image, the target
    is a tensor with the spatial resolution of the input image and with a channel
    for each class. Only a single value across all channels for every pixel equals
    one in a channel which number coincides with the number of the class. The rest
    values are zeros. Batch for model training consists of ten patches (512 per 512
    pixels each) randomly sampled from the dataset. As a neural network architecture,
    we chose Deeplab [72], which shows high performance in semantic segmentation tasks.
    Encoder is Resnet34 [73]. Optimizer is Adam with the initial learning rate value
    equal to 0.001. An exponential scheduler decreases the learning rate during training.
    The activation function for the last layer is softmax. As a loss function, weighted
    cross-entropy loss is used with weights set proportionally to the classes distribution.
    Models are trained for 200 epochs with early stopping after ten epochs without
    loss improving. The model with the lowest loss value is used for further analysis.
    To evaluate model performance on the test images set, we use F1-score and weighted
    F1-score [74] (Equation 1). F1-score for each class is weighted by the number
    of samples (pixels) from that class to provide a more balanced final averaged
    assessment. F 1 i = F 1 weighted = TP TP+ 1 2 (FP+FN) , ∑ M i F 1 i ∗weigh t i
    N (1) View Source where F 1 i – F1-score for the i -th class, M – the number of
    classes, weigh t i – the number of pixels of the i -th class, N – the number of
    all pixels, TP is True Positive (number of correctly classified pixels of the
    given class), FP is False Positive (number of pixels classified as the given class
    while in fact being of other class, and FN is False Negative (number of pixels
    of the given class, missed by the method). In our experiment, we apply repeated
    random subsampling validation with three repetitions. It means that we repeat
    the data splitting and model training procedure three times with different dataset
    splits and average the results. SECTION V. XtremeAugment Results Results for the
    semantic segmentation task are shown in Table 2. It includes predictions separately
    for indoor test images and wild outdoor images. The baseline in the table corresponds
    to the subset that was used for model training. More precisely, it is data from
    a single logitech_right viewpoint. Baseline_no_augment means that no augmentation
    was used during training. Baseline_regular_augment means training on the baseline
    data with commonly-used augmentation. Baseline_strong_augment means training with
    a higher number of augmentations and with higher transformations magnitudes. Note
    that experiments without augmentation and with too strong augmentations are added
    for demonstration purposes. The proposed XtremeAugment approach allows us to improve
    the baseline F1-score from 0.949 to 0.97. The best probability of using OBA during
    training is 50%, which means that only half of training samples are augmented
    using new backgrounds. Original images are vital for robust model performance,
    and they should not be excluded from the training as it leads to an F1-score decrease
    to 0.895. We also show the contribution of HDA and OBA approaches separately in
    the segmentation task. In the Lab test set, HDA allows prediction improvement
    from an F1-score of 0.949 to 0.963. OBA achieves an F1-score of 0.959. TABLE 2
    Apple Segmentation Results (F1-Score) The results clearly indicate that the baseline
    model fails to predict wild images (averaged F1-score is 0.29). The proposed approach
    exhibits significantly higher results for the wild test set (F1-score is 0.91).
    Models’ predictions for wild images are presented in Figure 9. Although the training
    dataset does not include images with apples taken outside in various conditions,
    the XtremeAugment approach performs more confidently even on wild images. FIGURE
    9. Results of the baseline, HDA, OBA, and XtremeAugment. Show All Beyond the mean
    values of accuracy across three cross-validation repetitions, the standard deviation
    also provides essential statistics. In our experiment, it dropped from 0.082 in
    the baseline to 0.0054 with XtremeAugment on images in the wild. The decrease
    in results standard deviation indicates the increase in model stability. The reason
    for the substantial improvement with our approach when the test subset is more
    complex than the training subset is in narrowing the gap between these domains
    (see Figure 2). More precisely, in the presented case, a model without OBA is
    not robust to complex backgrounds because only the uniform background is in the
    original training subset. HDA contributes to the robustness to change in illumination
    conditions and view angles. OBA and HDA separately also improve the baseline as
    they provide more diverse training data. However, experiments indicate that OBA
    outperforms HDA in the wild images segmentation task (F1-score 0.89 and 0.35)
    compared to the Lab test set. One can also see that baseline without any augmentation
    or with too strong augmentation performers poorly. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this
    article, we have proposed the comprehensive framework which provides an easy,
    reliable, and scalable way to collect image datasets and to efficiently augment
    the collected data. The proposed approach is called XtremeAugment and consists
    of the hardware dataset augmentation (HDA) which performs during the data collection
    stage, and the object-based augmentation (OBA) which performs after image labeling.
    We prove the efficiency of our method using the apple rotten segmentation problem
    as an example. XtremeAugment is designed for the few-shot computer vision problems.
    It is especially promising for the type of the domain adaptation tasks where the
    target domain is more difficult in terms of the surrounding of the objects than
    a source domain. In our experiment we collect images in the laboratory conditions
    with good illumination, uniform background, and a large distance between the apples.
    To test the models we use, on the contrary, images in the wild. XtremeAugment
    outperforms the baseline by a 0.62 F-score providing an accurate model with very
    limited training data. The separate components of XtremeAugment have their limitations.
    HDA must be used during the data collection and requires additional control over
    the imaging process. OBA can be only applied if the dataset is accompanied by
    the instance segmentation masks. However, we also show that HDA and OBA can be
    applied independently and still ensure an increase in the model accuracy. Although
    our method requires labeled images, it allows for significant simplification of
    the labeling process. First, it can use images with uniform backgrounds and without
    overlapping that are faster to label. Also, some images obtained with HDA can
    share the same segmentation mask. Along with the code for HDA and OBA, we share
    the collected dataset of multiview apples spoil segmentation and the dataset on
    various backgrounds in the wild. In our future work, we will explore the context-based
    OBA approaches and vary camera and lighting parameters, and combinations of XtremeAugment
    with other image augmentation techniques. Another promising topic to investigate
    is the curriculum learning. Curriculum learning changes the ‘hardness’ of the
    samples during model training. Typically, it is difficult to mine samples of a
    certain “hardness”; however, the OBA algorithm allows controlling it explicitly
    by tuning the objects overlapping and other hyperparameters. It is also worth
    mentioning that the augmentation hyperparameters can be further optimized, but
    even with a naive setup, XtremeAugment proves its efficiency. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The
    authors would like to thank the use of the Skoltech CDISE supercomputer Zhores
    for obtaining the results presented in this paper and Fablab of Skoltech for discussions
    about experiment setup. Svetlana Illarionova and Ivan Oseledets were involved
    in Section III, Section IV, and Section V. Appendix A Image Collection System
    Methodology In this section, we explain the concepts behind the image collection
    system. We aim to design a system that can be easily used by a wide range of researchers
    to collect data and automate processes in labs. Therefore our system must meet
    the following requirements: consists of cheap equipment; is reliable; is easy-to-use.
    In practice, there is a trade-off between the device cost and reliability. To
    have an opportunity to work with non-expensive industrial-level equipment but
    obtain a stable system as a whole, we adhere to the fault-tolerant design. To
    simplify the usage and, by implication, reduce the number of potential user-related
    mistakes, we use a declarative programming project design approach. SECTION A.
    Fault-Tolerant Design To reach a smooth program execution and ensure its sustainability,
    we propose and apply the following techniques. 1) Relaunching on Fault There are
    different reasons why a system can turn off. Usually, it is due to power outages.
    We recommend adding an extra battery to the system circuit to address this issue,
    but we relaunch a project if accidental halting occurs regardless of its presence.
    2) Graceful Degradation Another vital concept that we use in our design is called
    graceful degradation: even if some parts of a system fail, the rest will operate
    smoothly. For example, if any single sensor stops responding, it should not affect
    the other ones. 3) Critical Issues Alerting Even though it is preferable to continue
    system operation when a component does not respond, it is necessary to inform
    a user that something expects a fix or replacement. For this purpose, we use an
    alert bot. 4) Data Backupping If the project’s goal is to collect data, then data
    is the most valuable part of the whole system. To make sure that collected data
    is saved, we schedule its backup to another device. 5) Conflicts Prevention A
    common issue that is difficult to debug arises when multiple scripts or pipelines
    attempt to access the same resource. To exclude this type of problem, we check
    all the device usages in Scheduler before running any pipelines. If any different
    pipelines share the same devices, a user will see an alert. 6) Stateless Child
    Nodes A controller device makes it possible to manage the logic of the system.
    Sensors cannot operate without a controller. The reported system provides an opportunity
    to have more than one controller. It can be useful either if there are too many
    sensors to connect to a single controller or when sensors have to be distributed
    over a wide area. In such a case, one of the nodes will act as a main, and the
    others will be the child nodes. The child nodes are designed to be stateless,
    so they do not store any data or past transaction history. This interaction simplification
    allows the user to easily add, remove, or replace child nodes without main flow
    interruption. 7) Logging In order to investigate incidents, we log all the actions
    within the system, including system start, system restart, sensor measurements
    status, image capturing status, every pipeline execution time, errors during execution,
    and others. SECTION B. Declarative Programming Our system is designed according
    to the declarative programming paradigm and guarantees configuring of projects
    with different goals easily. Each project is a system in a concrete configuration
    that will perform the defined actions according to a schedule. Moreover, it is
    possible to launch multiple projects simultaneously. The project description in
    the proposed system is config-based. It allows creating new projects by defining
    the sequence of sensors to activate and the rule to start these actions. In other
    words, we declare what to do instead of how to do it. This approach helps both
    to simplify the modifications and avoid errors and side effects, which is vital
    when the project complexity starts to grow. For more details, refer to Appendix
    A. SECTION C. Framework Abstraction Layers In this section, we present the abstraction
    layers of the framework from the user perspective. We aim to show what users can
    do without diving into implementation details and also what can be modified using
    every next abstraction layer. In Figure 10, the upper plane corresponds to the
    highest abstraction layer, and the bottom plane is for the low-level functional.
    FIGURE 10. Image collection system abstraction layers. Show All When a project
    is already configured, all that users have to do is to monitor its performance
    using the functional of Supervision layer. It is easy to do via a Web User Interface
    (UI). It allows choosing what data to monitor and interactively shows collected
    images, plots sensors measurements, and describes auxiliary information about
    project configuration. We can place a monitor directly near the system in indoor
    projects and view its last collected data and state. While Web GUI is an appropriate
    solution for the collected data control and the cameras and sensors calibration,
    we use an alert bot for urgent notifications caused by failures. It will send
    a message to a user if any check or fix is required. To start an experiment, a
    typical user will need to use only the highest two abstraction layers. The Supervision
    layer described above enables continuous project monitoring, and the Project Configuration
    layer provides a straightforward way to set up a project with concrete goals and
    existing hardware. We propose a config-based project description that does not
    require any programming skills from the users for a usual project. It means that
    all that the user has to do is to list his hardware in sensors and camera configuration
    files and to list the sequence of actions. We describe it in more detail in Appendix
    A. Another feature of this layer is the system state configuration. It provides
    an opportunity to create aggregated states and reuse them. State reusing operates
    in the same way as the reusing functions, but instead of code, a state can include
    other low-level states. For instance, a user may need to switch several actuators
    simultaneously many times. To avoid unnecessary code repetitions, we can aggregate
    all simultaneous actions in a single state and switch states in a pipeline. An
    aggregated state will contain instructions for all the involved devices, and all
    of that instructions will be executed every time when the state is called. If
    the Project Configuration layer allows to aggregate system states, the Functional
    layer can aggregate and add new functions. Here we can define the actions that
    will be further used in configuration files. The basic functions needed for most
    of the projects are already implemented. If one needs some specific operations,
    it is easy to add them in the Functional layer having basic Python programming
    skills. The Peripheral layer can be used to add new types of hardware. It needs
    a more advanced programming level; however, most of the hardware has some description
    or ready-to-use drivers. The Framework Core layer consists of the modules that
    empower system operation. The system logic and various platform support are implemented
    within this layer. Usually, the users do not have to worry about this level’s
    details and do not have to make any modifications here. Appendix B Image Collection
    System Implementation In this section, we go through the implementation details
    and describe the relations between system modules. The system is developed in
    Python 3 programming language and is suitable to use with Linux-driven devices.
    The working prototype is deployed on Raspberry Pi 4 single-board computer. Some
    of the system features, such as general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins access,
    are now implemented only for the Raspberry Pi boards family and Troyka Cap extension
    boards. A child node can be any device that can communicate over Wi-Fi. So, if
    your main node is not Raspberry and you need GPIO functionality, you can attach,
    for example, another Arduino or ESP266 micro-controller to the system. The high-level
    system architecture is reflected in Figure 11. Rectangles in the figure represent
    modules; ovals represent data. FIGURE 11. High-level system architecture. Show
    All If we want to add more than one controller node, a single main node will send
    commands to all the child nodes. From the users’ point of view, devices on child
    nodes are accessible the same as any device on the main node, but they are called
    remote devices. SECTION D. Configuration Files To create a new project, we have
    to prepare configuration files (configs). The configs are stored as JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) files. We distinguish three types of configs: hardware
    configs, state configs, and pipelines. 1) Hardware Configs We have separate configuration
    files for sensors and cameras. To add a sensor, we define its name and bind it
    to some pin on a board. Now the system supports Raspberry Pi and Amperka Troyka
    Cap boards. Also, we set a device type, and it is ready to use. To add a camera,
    we separately list web cameras and SLR cameras and define their unique names.
    2) State Configs A state is a way to describe multiple simultaneous actions that
    do not require any feedback. For example, if we have many actuators such as lamps
    or water pumps, and we need to switch all of them at once, we can define one state
    with all the actuators switched on and another state with all the actuators switched
    off. Another opportunity that appears with states is access to the current state
    from any task. Thus, states enable pipelines to communicate to each other with
    the mediator instead of direct communication. In Section IV, we outline a case
    where we switch lighting conditions to alter the resulting images. In this case,
    the lighting state is known to the task that makes images, and we can add this
    state name to the image name or record. To make state configuration flexible,
    we introduce three types of states. A permanent state type is assigned to the
    system when triggered and becomes available from any pipeline. It both switches
    the actuators and assigns itself to be the current system state as described above.
    An interrupt state type, in the opposite, only switches actuators without changing
    the current state name. A recovery state type is used to return the system to
    the latest permanent state after an interruption. 3) Pipelines A pipeline in our
    system is a logically connected sequence of actions that a system must start at
    some time or start with some intervals. A pipeline is also stored in a JSON file
    [75]. The user starts defining a pipeline by setting a rule to trigger a pipeline
    in cron notation [76]. It is a flexible and widespread way to schedule scripts
    that allow repetitive and one-time tasks to schedule. A pipeline’s body consists
    of blocks with task type, optional device name, and optional parameters. There
    are several predefined types of tasks, but users can extend them with new ones.
    The basic task types are: actuator; sensor; state switching; sleeping. An actuator
    is any attached device that performs some action. Lamps and various motors are
    typical examples of actuators. A sensor is a device that makes some measurements.
    In our implementation, any call to a sensor is automatically decorated for saving
    collected data with a timestamp. So, a user does not have to worry about data
    saving from each sensor separately. Another feature that sensor abstraction provides
    is an automatic repetition of multiple measurements in a row with further outlier
    removal and averaging. State switching means changing a state, as described in
    this section above. The user chooses a list of predefined states and picks one
    of them. Sleeping is the most generic task type. It is used to stay idle for a
    certain amount of time. An important feature is that we can activate multiple
    pipelines simultaneously. Each pipeline solves its independent problem, and they
    communicate with other pipelines via the system state. SECTION E. Scheduler The
    system core unit is the Scheduler. It is based on a standard Python APScheduler.
    For its functioning, Scheduler requires configs and pipelines. Scheduler sets
    up a project, creates all the necessary directories, checks pipelines, and launches
    them. A vital job of the Scheduler is to check that different pipelines do not
    use the same equipment to ensure that no conflicts will occur. This core module
    orchestrates the work of all other modules, starts and finishes the project. An
    internal part of the Scheduler is a Pipeline Executor. It parses and completes
    concrete pipelines received from the Scheduler. In Figure 10, Pipeline Executor
    is referred to as a Functional layer because here, all the user functions are
    implemented. SECTION F. Logger The Logger is used to write down all system operations.
    The Logger is based on a standard Python logging module. It records actions for
    the system in general and each pipeline independently. Actions and errors can
    have different importance. Depending on the importance, log records can be handled
    differently. For instance, critical errors are alerted to the users by a bot,
    and warnings can be shown during the system initialization. SECTION G. Drivers
    Drivers can be perceived as adapters that enable a uniform interface for all the
    devices. To reach that, every sensor or camera must be inherited from the abstract
    base sensor or camera classes accordingly. These base classes oblige to implement
    necessary functions to return the measured values. SECTION H. Backupper The goal
    of the Backupper is to send the collected data to some other cloud or local device
    to increase reliability by adding the redundancy. SECTION I. Dashboard The Dashboard
    is a Web interface that provides easy access to the collected data. To create
    an interactive interface, we wrote a server based on the Streamlit framework.
    A user can choose what data to load. Images are shown for each camera separately
    in different tiles. A slider near each tile allows scrolling to the requested
    image capturing time. The sensors’ measurements are shown as plots. We can also
    load the project configuration details and logs to an interface. Authors Figures

    Location: Chengdu, China SECTION I. Introduction Nowadays rapid population growth
    is a major challenge. Only increasing agricultural production can meet the challenges
    of rapid growth of population. Technology is the only key to increase the production
    in agriculture in terms of quality and quantity. Big data technology can be an
    appropriate instrument to increase agriculture production and meet the future
    challenges. According to FAO [1], the production of food should be increased up
    to 70% by 2050 against the increasing population 9.6 billion by 2050 against the
    increasing population 9.6 billion by 2050. Not only that there are some other
    barriers hampering the increasing production like slow-down productivity, scarcity
    of arable land, climate change effect, scarcity of fresh water, price like energy,
    and rapid urbanization. In these so many limitations, smart technology and devices
    like internet of thing (IOT), cloud computing and big data can help to enhance
    agricultural production. Smart agriculture uses the information and communication
    technology, modern machinery equipment, IOT, Cloud computing [2], machine learning
    and big data analytics for crop’s vegetative growth inter-cultural operation,
    climate smart management, harvesting, post-harvest management and marketing management
    [3]. Modern technologies are trying to develop and push robots and artificial
    intelligence in agriculture through IOT, cloud computing and big data analytics.
    The use of big data analytics, sensors and GPS services make the smart and precision
    agriculture [4]. It generally uses most updated technological facilities to maximize
    yield pen unit land in a sustainable way in terms of financial earnings, quality
    and amount. Smart agriculture is a key tool to handle and manage the threats,
    challenges and risks in the context of climate change, diseases and pest attack
    and ensure sustainability [5]. A clear concept and understanding big data are
    necessary for its proper use and address the challenges of crop cultivation, animal
    fish and farming management. There is a long debate an agriculture data like which
    one is agricultural big data and which one is not. Some scholar raises the question
    "farm data is really big data". Big agricultural data focuses the agricultural
    information characterizing high volume, variety, variability velocity and veracity
    which requires specific analytical approach and technology to transform data into
    value or ready to use in agriculture. Since big data and smart agriculture are
    relatively new concept, so it requires more study to explore the applicability
    in the field of agriculture. Big-data driven smart agriculture is also a new paradigm
    in agriculture. Some researchers are positive on the application of big data in
    agriculture but others feel doubt about the big data application in agriculture
    [6]–[9]. This study is an attempt to participate in this debate by providing insight
    into the state of the art of the application of big data for smart agriculture.
    Literature survey shows that a few studies have been done in the field of big
    data and agriculture, but how big data can contribute on smart agriculture is
    still lacking. The study mainly focuses on the socio-economic aspect on big data
    application in agriculture considering all the components of agriculture in almost
    all aspects. This study attempts to answer the research questions like (a) what
    is the impact of big data on smart agriculture? And (b) what are the opportunity,
    threats and challenges of big data use in agricultureƒ A conceptual framework
    has been developed for future analysis and better understanding to answer the
    research questions. The paper is organized as the second section delineates the
    methodology, and conceptual framework in its third section. The main findings
    of the study describe in the fourth and fifth section and final section concludes
    the article with recommendations. SECTION II. Conceptual Framwork The big data
    has a big potential in the field of agriculture. The proper understanding of big
    data can help to solve the challenges of agricultural practices and subsequently
    increasing production and quality. According to Bronson [10], all kinds of farmers
    need to adopt big data technologies for meeting the needs of food and agriculture.
    Big data provides an opportunity to make a long-term relationship among various
    stakeholders of food and agriculture. Though big data driven agriculture did not
    get proper attention from the concerned authority like policy makers, administrators,
    academician and practioners, but no one can deny the importance of big data in
    present days. Now it is the high time to adopt the big data technologies for sustainable
    agriculture. It provides a new sight of scholarship for maintaining connection
    between big data and practical use of data in the farmer’s farm. According to
    Kamilaris et al. [11], various agricultural issues can be easily solved by using
    big data analytics through administering various algorithms, approaches and strategies.
    Schönfeld et al. [12] argues that modern technology like GPS is very much helpful
    for crop and livestock farming. Big data technology can help various stakeholders
    like farmers, agricultural machinery manufacturers, input suppliers, businessman
    and related policy makers for avoiding unexpected situation and getting proper
    benefits. Smart agriculture also helps to avoid the adverse effect of climate
    change and take a long-term decision [8]. It also provides an opportunity to produce
    food more efficiently by analyzing data. Smart agriculture includes automated
    agricultural machinery, monitoring disease and pest interruption, measuring nutrient
    requirement of plant, irrigation requirement and identifying harvesting time.
    It uses sensor network, satellite imaging, various data like historical weather
    and yield data. Not only that smart agriculture integrates the concept of core
    agricultural disciplines with computer science, machine learning, software engineering,
    environmental science, human resource management, risk management and disaster
    management. Bendre et al. [14] argues that future agriculture will be based on
    proper forecasting with real time-based information which helps to avoid undesired
    circumstances. SECTION III. Methodology The study uses a systematic literature
    review to answer the research questions by searching literature between January,
    2010 to December, 2018. Since the concept of big data is relatively new so this
    period has been taken into consideration. This systematic literature is divided
    into two steps. The first step select focuses systematic survey of three renowned
    data bases viz. web of science, engineering village and Scopus. On the other hand,
    the second step focuses on snowball approaches for selecting quality researches
    items for detailed study. In first step, some important keyword like "big data,
    data-driven, smart agriculture, farming, internet of thing (IOT) and precision
    agriculture" have been used. The three data bases are selected for this study
    due to these large data base covering wide range of literature and citation. Due
    to rigorous and systematic process in the literature review, it is considered
    as original research [10]. This systematic review has been confined to the role
    big data on the transformation of traditional agriculture to smart agriculture.
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines
    have been followed to conduct the review process [11]. At first 711 Documents
    have been retrieved. The study uses inclusion criteria like relevant research
    objectives and full article availability and article in English language. The
    study also uses exclusion criteria like no full text, no relevancy of objectives,
    article highlighting only technical side of big data technology. 357 documents
    have been selected after duplicate and non-relevancy removal. Then during abstract
    screening 217 documents have been removed. Finally, rest 168 documents have been
    removed by following exclusion criteria and finally found 49 documents have been
    selected for qualitative analysis by following the qualitative document selection
    checklist of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
    (STROBE) [12]. The final selection includes journal article, book, book chapter
    and conference proceeding. SECTION IV. Big Data in Agriculture A. The Concept
    of Agricultural Big Data Data is a potential tool for taking decision according
    to analyzing the situation. Agricultural big data means a lot of data is created
    naturally from different stages from seed sawing to harvesting. Big data in agriculture
    can help to renovate the practices of agriculture which can easily contribute
    in all dimensions of agriculture viz crop, livestock, fish, and agribusiness.
    Big data technology in agriculture is able to collect and analyze the lots of
    data which usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture. It
    is a new pathway to collect and analyze the big amount of data obtained from agricultural
    farm to the consumers. The collection of big data in agriculture is known as "crowed
    sourced" which can be done through aerial vehicles or drones, using special cameras
    and smart phones covering from satellites to smart phone applications. It is usually
    stored in computer database and processed by computer algorithms. There are some
    applications already initiated in agricultural big data management like AgriPrice
    Book developed by North America Strategic Institute in 2014 for helping farmers
    to leverage data for enhancing transparency in agricultural supply chain. Similarly,
    Citizen Science developed by CGIAR for promoting climate change and food security
    management. Agricultural big data can be used for analyzing seed characteristics,
    weather pattern, soil properties like pH or nutrient content, marketing and trade
    management, consumers’ behavior and inventory management [15]. The data source
    may be biological, geo-spatial and environmental. Agricultural big data can be
    used by researchers, policy makers, farmers and related stakeholders. It can be
    potentially used by researchers for research purposes, policy making, short and
    long-term decision making, proper management of crop, livestock and fisheries,
    and business management [16]. The major concepts on agricultural big data are
    summarizes in Table I. TABLE I. Summarizing Major Concept on Agricultural Big
    Data B. Sources of Agricultural Big Data Agricultural sector produces a huge amount
    of data which is usually used in agricultural research but in a limited scale.
    Big data technology provides an opportunity to use the data following scientific
    procedure and making right decision at right time. Some large companies like Deere,
    Dow and Monsanto are using big data analytics for development of modern technology
    and tools. Agricultural big data can be used by a holistic approach comprising
    various related technology and related sector’s data. No single source’s data
    are not enough to make a proper decision. Data should be collected from different
    sources like soil related data, intercultural management related data, climate
    related data, long term census data, harvesting data, cropping pattern data, and
    agribusiness data [7]. FAO already developed an approach entitled to Agricultural
    Meta data Element Set (AgMES) to handle the huge amount of agricultural data,
    phenotypic and genomic data related to plant growth, resistance capacity to diseases
    and pest, and high yield characters are necessary to develop high yielding and
    resistant variety. Wireless sensor network is a solution for collecting agricultural
    data from laboratory and field. Multifunctional devices should be selected as
    sensor network which can easily handle, long lasting and at low price. A good
    filed sensor is necessary comprising Wi-Fi router, sensors, internet connected
    camera and solar cells and flexible install system so that any digital devices
    can be installed in future [23]. Some field server may not be applicable for all
    kinds of farm. So, customized field server is necessary for different types of
    farm for more compatibility. It should be based on the characteristics of climate
    condition, soil condition, crop varieties, and other related physical factors.
    Data infrastructure should be such that which bears a number of functionally independent
    module. The module will comprise a number of services and always connect with
    web-based API and non-network API. The infrastructure should be flexible to adopt
    any new module without changing the core command. Multi-layer meta-language data
    query system should be developed for smooth data collection and interoperation
    among the systems by using GeoSPARQL standard vocabularies, OGC WMS (Web map service),
    OGC WES (Web Feature Service) and Web Coverage Service (OGC WCS). Data visualization
    is necessary to understand geo-spatial data, identifying pattern, trend and any
    disorder for better use of data. Vector ARIMA model can be used for historical
    and multi-layered data for better future prediction. Other prominent data mining
    tools like SVM (Support Vector Method), Decision Tree and Discriminant Analysis
    can be used for proper data mining. The above tools and technology can be easily
    used to collect agricultural big data. SECTION V. Data-Driven Smart Agriculture
    A. Concept of Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is the third revolutionary green
    agriculture which uses information communication technology (ICT) in its practices.
    It is a key instrument to achieve sustainable agriculture following modern technology
    [24]. It is the collection of real time data related to edaphic (soil) and environmental
    factors, planting, intercultural management and harvesting, cost and pest management
    for proper prediction of future and decision making. According to statistics,
    big data driver agriculture helps to reduce the cost up to 50% band increase yield
    about 20%. Smart agriculture can tackle all the threats related to crop, fish
    or animal production by avoiding risks pest attack, soil and environmental factors.
    It is one of the key tools for achieving sustainable agriculture. It also helps
    to protect natural resources and environment. It is based on ecosystem friendly
    approach which applies the practices of major disciplines like biological, physical,
    economic and social sciences in a holistic way. Big data is an appropriate tool
    to transform, traditional agriculture and drive the smart agriculture. B. Drivers
    for Big Data in Smart Agriculture Application of big data in agriculture is comparatively
    new approach but the trend of application is positive. It can bring a revolutionary
    change in food supply chain and food security through increasing production. It
    provides an opportunity to use it in case of in-depth, and advance level of game
    changing analytics for sustainable development in agriculture [14]. The major
    technologies of big data are benchmarking, data analytics, sensor installation,
    models related to prediction and management for avoiding agricultural production
    challenges and threats and increasing optimum production. It usually uses predictive
    model related to yield and feed intake and feed intake and ensures just-in-time
    decision making related to production and business. Though decision making is
    generally done by human but computer can help to take proper decision using big
    data analytics. The agricultural practices and food chain are influenced by the
    mechanization and modern technology. Smart agriculture is largely depended on
    some push and pull factors of big data applications. 1) Pull factors Sustainable
    agriculture is a condition to increase the production and quality of agricultural
    products in an optimized level without hampering the future [7]. It can be achieved
    by investing new and modern technology of big data. It can minimize the cost and
    efficiency of farmers and helps to achieve smart agriculture. Information has
    a power to take right decision at time by right way. Big data application in agriculture
    helps agriculture to conduct all practices based on analyzing the information.
    The traditional agriculture was based on the traditional practices without analyzing
    the information but smart agriculture requires a continuous flow of information
    and knowledge prioritizing the specific local contexts. The specific localization
    of knowledge helps to understand the local environmental factors which ultimately
    helps to take proper decision of agricultural practices [25]. The early warning
    system about the adverse climatic condition helps to avoid the harmful effect
    of climate on agriculture [26]. It also helps to ensure climate smart agriculture.
    The consumer demand is another major concern to maintain the quality of the product.
    Smart agriculture always concerns about the production, quality, food safety and
    food security by using big data technologies. 2) Push factors The major push factors
    in smart agriculture are the adoption of smart devices in every stage of agriculture
    from seed sowing to harvesting, post-harvest management and marketing. The smart
    devices should be connected to each other through automated system and will provide
    ready data to take any decision easily. Precision agriculture is one of the key
    drivers for big data application in agriculture and potential instrument for achieving
    smart agriculture. In precision agriculture, the smart devices are linked with
    each other by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology and wireless network infrastructures
    [7]. The use of smart devices and modern technology ensure easy access to information
    and enhancing decision making capacity which ultimately change the dramatical
    positive change in agriculture. It encourages many companies to establish this
    kind of business. The big data technology helps famer to input their manual data
    in the smart devices if necessary, which also ensures a human-machine interaction
    in agriculture. Table II helps to understand the state-of-art technologies for
    smart agriculture. TABLE II. State of the Art of Big Data Applications in Smart
    Farming and Key Issues C. Challenges of Big Data Use in Agriculture There are
    two types of challenges in big data application for smart agriculture like technical
    challenges and organizational challenges [15]. The technical challenges are related
    to technology and installing technical devices, technical expertise, information
    technology (IT) infrastructure, power supply and maintaining the intranet for
    smooth automated data transfer. The organizational challenges are related to investment,
    personnel recruitment, monitoring, IT expert team, expert agriculturist, and overall
    management. The major considerations are investment and revenue with maintaining
    yield, quality, safety and security. At first stage, it requires huge investment
    for setup the infrastructure of smart agriculture. It is possible for developing
    country where farmers have a lot of lands and technological smart devices are
    available but it is hard for populous developing country to make infrastructure.
    Similarly, it is hard for subsistence farmer in developing country to tackle the
    other technical and organizational challenges [27]. The automated data transfer
    system should be developed in a way that requires no excess cost and run smoothly.
    An advanced level of infrastructure is necessary for data acquisition and smooth
    transfer of data which finally use for decision making. The privacy and security
    of data are the major organizational challenges of big data governance. There
    are so many kinds of workers are working in a farm, if anybody violates the privacy
    and security matters that will be harmful for farming as well as business. The
    working staff should be motivated and trained carefully to handle the whole matters.
    Linkages among related organizations should be developed to maintain food chain
    and smooth management of smart agricultural farm [28]. Availability and quality
    of the data is necessary to handle the smart agriculture but it is hard to get
    continuous, quality and specific data [1]. The automated system should be developed
    in such a way that data flow is continuous, structured, certain and specific.
    A lack of systemic integration may cause a big problem or fault data may invite
    big disaster in agriculture. Data from various sources may require to take decision,
    so an interaction is necessary with other related stakeholders for smooth running
    of smart agricultural farm. D. Pathway of Achieving Sustainable Agriculture through
    Big Data Application The proposed conceptual model for smart agriculture has been
    shown in Figure 1. The conceptual model consists of seven steps from data source
    for outcome of smart agriculture. The first step explains the detail data sources.
    The second step describes the technological involvement in smart agriculture.
    The processing unit comprises five modules. The internet of agricultural things
    (IoAT) is based on edaphic and climate sensors under sensor kit module. The main
    storage, mining, analysis and related application are connected with Agrocloude
    module. Government and Agrobank module are directed related to outcome of the
    model that means helping farmers for getting basic services from government and
    bank. Figure 1. A conceptual model of big data driven smart agriculture for sustainable
    agriculture. Show All The institutional setting provides in details of external
    and internal factors which may influence the process of smart agriculture in its
    fourth step. Governing chain process explains the crop and livestock production
    with marketing in its fifth step. Sixth and final step provides the key indicators
    and outcome of smart agriculture. SECTION VI. Conclusion and Recommendations Big
    data driven smart agriculture is now the demand of reality. People can’t move
    forward without avoiding this reality. It is required to face the challenges of
    food security, food safety as well as much population pressure. This study is
    an attempt to explore the best and compatible practices which can help farmers
    at field level for increasing production and improving quality. This study reveals
    a number of available big data technologies and practices in agriculture for solving
    the current problems and future challenges at field level. It also suggests a
    model which consists of seven stages and covers from data source to outcome and
    interprets how data can help to achieve sustainable agriculture through using
    big data technology. The article explores that there are still some challenges
    exists in this field as a new domain in agriculture like privacy of data, data
    quality, availability, initial investment, infrastructure and related expertise.
    Though big data cannot get proper attention from agriculture sector, but it will
    develop the agricultural practices within shortest possible time. The study suggests
    that government initiatives, public-private partnership, openness of data, financial
    investment and regional basis research work are necessary for implementing the
    big data technologies in agriculture at large scale. It also suggests that a long-term
    planning is necessary to implement the big data technologies with installing all
    available smart devices and the government level initiative is necessary to implement
    it irrespective of developing and developed countries. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This article

  analysis: The work introduced a novel method for the quantitative prediction of
    the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass of standing vegetation for cereal
    crops at sub-meter resolutions by applying a combination of UAV–LiDAR surveys
    and ML supervised regression models. Using two crop species (winter wheat and
    barley) at the same field site over two consecutive growing seasons, the authors
    demonstrated the feasibility of achieving valid predictions when using the same
    crop species for training and testing and a reduction in the prediction accuracy
    when training on one crop type and testing on another due to differences in the
    canopy structures and the plant-level biomass distributions of the two crop species
    under consideration. The authors encourage the continuation of protocolized field-based
    data collection campaigns, as well as UAV–LiDAR surveying to gain valuable data
    that are representative of crops under different environmental conditions. These
    data can be used to develop AGB regression models that are more robust to inter-annual
    and inter-species variations.

    \ endeavors to enhance the accuracy of in situ above-ground biomass (AGB) predic-\n\
    tion for croplands rely on close-range monitoring surveys that use unstaffed aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs)\nand mounted sensors. In precision agriculture, light detection\
    \ and ranging (LiDAR) technologies are\ncurrently used to monitor crop growth,\
    \ plant phenotyping, and biomass dynamics at the ecosystem\nscale. In this study,\
    \ we utilized a UAV–LiDAR sensor to monitor two crop ﬁelds and a set of ma-\n\
    chine learning (ML) methods to predict real-time AGB over two consecutive years\
    \ in the region of\nMid-Jutland, Denmark. During each crop growing period, UAV\
    \ surveys were conducted in parallel\nwith AGB destructive sampling every 7–15\
    \ days, the AGB samples from which were used as the\nground truth data. We evaluated\
    \ the ability of the ML models to estimate the real-time values of\nAGB at a sub-meter\
    \ resolution (0.17–0.52 m2). An extremely randomized trees (ERT) regressor was\n\
    selected for the regression analysis, based on its predictive performance for\
    \ the ﬁrst year’s growing\nseason. The model was retrained using previously identiﬁed\
    \ hyperparameters to predict the AGB\nof the crops in the second year. The ERT\
    \ performed AGB estimation using height and reﬂectance\nmetrics from LiDAR-derived\
    \ point cloud data and achieved a prediction performance of R2 = 0.48\nat a spatial\
    \ resolution of 0.35 m2. The prediction performance could be improved signiﬁcantly\
    \ by\naggregating adjacent predictions (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.93 at spatial resolutions\
    \ of 1 m2 and 2 m2,\nrespectively) as they ultimately converged to the reference\
    \ biomass values because any individual\nerrors averaged out. The AGB prediction\
    \ results were examined as function of predictor type, training\nset size, sampling\
    \ resolution, phenology, and canopy density. The results demonstrated that when\n\
    combined with ML regression methods, the UAV–LiDAR method could be used to provide\
    \ accurate\nreal-time AGB prediction for crop ﬁelds at a high resolution, thereby\
    \ providing a way to map their\nbiochemical constituents.\nKeywords: UAV–LiDAR;\
    \ machine learning; above-ground biomass; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    Non-destructive crop surveying techniques are currently being developed to aid\n\
    decision-making in precision agriculture [1]. Developing accurate crop monitoring\
    \ meth-\nods is an important step toward improving climate change adaptation strategies\
    \ within\nagroecosystem management and food production systems [2]. It is expected\
    \ that the results\nof this study could have particular impacts on the following\
    \ two research areas: (i) food\nsecurity assessment [3] in the face of global\
    \ land use [4] and climate changes [5–7]; (ii) crop\nyield modeling [8–10] and\
    \ nutrient cycle studies [11,12].\nThe expansion of ﬁeld studies and crop monitoring\
    \ systems is therefore strongly\nencouraged by both the modeling community (to\
    \ test and calibrate models) and the culti-\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14163912\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912\n2 of\
    \ 22\nvation community (to enable adaptive harvesting operations and the real-time\
    \ monitoring\nof nutritional constituents) [13].\nAbove-ground biomass (AGB) is\
    \ a fundamental agronomic parameter that accounts\nfor the content of dry biomass\
    \ in the standing part of plants. It is an indicator for the\nphenological and\
    \ health status of plants, as well as their nutrient contents [14]. As such,\n\
    accurate AGB mapping is a crucial component for a wide range of scientiﬁc disciplines,\n\
    including precision agriculture and agroecology [15]. Most established techniques\
    \ for\nacquiring remote sensing (RS)-based estimates of AGB primarily rely on\
    \ (i) passive opti-\ncal and (ii) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) methods. However,\
    \ these techniques present\nlimitations. When SAR signals become saturated with\
    \ increasing AGB [16,17], its efﬁcacy\nin AGB mapping is sensitive to polarization\
    \ and the combination of available bands [18].\nFurthermore, it is primarily suited\
    \ to mapping highly vegetated areas, such as woodlands\nand forests [19–21], and\
    \ it has been shown to overestimate AGB in areas with low biomass\nlevels [22,23].\
    \ Passive optical methods have been extensively applied in precision agricul-\n\
    ture [24,25]. These methods are bound to two-dimensional features that are derived\
    \ from\nvarious parameters, such as canopy structure [26], image texture [27,28],\
    \ and greenness\nindices [24,29], which also suffer from substantial signal saturation\
    \ and limitations that are\nlinked to spectral resolution and radiometric sensor\
    \ calibration [24,25]. In comparison to\nSAR and passive optical methods, regression\
    \ models that are derived from light detection\nand ranging (LiDAR) data consistently\
    \ achieve better results [30,31] and have become the\npreferred option when precise\
    \ spatial AGB distributions are required [21].\nLiDAR is an active sensing technique\
    \ that is based on pulses of light. The reﬂections\nof these pulses are detected\
    \ by the same device, which allows the precise location of\nintercepted objects\
    \ to be determined based on the laser pulse travel time [32]. Variations\nin illumination\
    \ and other atmospheric conditions do not affect the resulting data as much\n\
    as the data from passive optical sensors. Progress in LiDAR technology has enabled\n\
    advanced terrestrial ecosystem research. High-density LiDAR point cloud data (PCD)\
    \ are\ncurrently used to investigate several variables, such as plant-level morphological\
    \ traits in\nagroecosystems [33] and forests [34–36], as well as light–ecosystem\
    \ interactions [37,38]. In\nfact, the integration of LiDAR systems in ecosystem\
    \ monitoring at different scales (from\nthe plot to ecosystem or regional level),\
    \ combined with new modeling techniques [39–41],\nis broadening the ﬁeld’s perspectives\
    \ in an unprecedented manner [32]. The use of LiDAR\nsystems in unstaffed aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) allows for the collection of PCD at sub-cm\nresolutions, which\
    \ has enabled the development of a growing number of applications\nin agroecosystem\
    \ monitoring [42–44]. This data collection technique, combined with\nmachine learning\
    \ (ML) regression methods, has proved to be useful for the precise AGB\nquantiﬁcation\
    \ of croplands [45–48] and forest ecosystems [49].\nAdvanced ML methods can attain\
    \ better performances in regression tasks than the\nmethods that are commonly\
    \ used in AGB research (e.g., linear and power regression models\nthat take the\
    \ architectural and ancillary traits of plants as their inputs [50–52]). This\
    \ is due\nto the ability of ML methods to account for more complex non-linear\
    \ relationships between\npredictors and AGB. There is a growing interest in applying\
    \ these recently developed\nML methods to AGB prediction for land ecosystems.\
    \ Recent state-of-the-art studies have\ncombined ML methods and UAV-sensed data\
    \ [53–55]. For example, Ma et al. [56] estimated\nthe AGB of croplands using convolutional\
    \ neural networks and close-range imagery, while\nPan et al. [48] used neural\
    \ networks (with so-called attention-based modules) and rover-\nborne LiDAR PCD\
    \ as direct inputs instead of statistics. There have been many studies on\nAGB\
    \ prediction using ML methods, ranging from sub-meter resolutions [48] to coarser\n\
    resolutions [53,54,56]. However, the spatial resolution and spatial distributions\
    \ of AGB\npredictions [55] are important factors that have strong inﬂuences on\
    \ the obtained results.\nThe effects of these two factors are usually not considered,\
    \ which makes it difﬁcult to\ncompare the results that have been reported in the\
    \ literature.\nThis study aimed to test the following hypotheses: discrete return\
    \ UAV–LiDAR\nsurveys are a valid technique for providing accurate estimates of\
    \ crop structures in dense\nagricultural crops that allow for AGB regression analysis;\
    \ the distribution of LiDAR PCD\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912\n3 of 22\nfeatures\
    \ empirically relates to the patterns of AGB distribution across crop ﬁelds; the\n\
    empirical relationship between (i) the patterns in the remotely sensed data and\
    \ (ii) those in\nthe AGB ﬁeld-based measurements can therefore be formulated as\
    \ a supervised regression\nproblem, which can then be learnt by an ML model to\
    \ predict AGB; and, therefore, it is\npossible to automate the accurate estimation\
    \ of AGB distributions in dense crops based on\nUAV–LiDAR surveys and ML regression\
    \ methods at high spatial resolutions.\nWe proposed a method for estimating the\
    \ spatial distributions of AGB in crop ﬁelds\nusing UAV–LiDAR for data acquisition\
    \ and ML methods for regression analysis. Our\nresults showed that this method\
    \ allowed real-time estimates of AGB in crops to be obtained\nat sub-meter resolutions\
    \ and was effective for two different species (barley and winter\nwheat) and contrasting\
    \ crop structures.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThis section presents the study\
    \ area, instrumentation, ﬁeld measurements, datasets,\nand methods that were employed\
    \ in this study.\n2.1. Study Area\nThe study area (Figure 1) was a conventionally\

    \ barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in 2020 and 2021\nand winter wheat (Triticum aestivum\
    \ L.) in 2021. The growing period of the barley lasted\nfrom the end of April\
    \ 2020 (shoot emergence) to the end of August 2020 (harvest) and\nfollowed a similar\
    \ cycle in 2021. In 2021, the growing period of the winter wheat extended\nfrom\
    \ January 2021 (shoot emergence) to the end of August 2021 (harvest). The conventional\n\
    agricultural practice at the site included the application of fertilizers in the\
    \ form of slurry\n(according to local regulations [57]), pesticides, and fungicides\
    \ throughout the growing\nseason, as well as sufﬁcient irrigation to prevent water\
    \ stress [58]. The region has a humid\ntemperate climate that is characterized\
    \ by a mean annual precipitation of 961.0 mm, a mean\nannual temperature of 8.1\
    \ °C, and an overcast or scattered cloud cover (with a mean annual\nincoming shortwave\
    \ radiation of 108 W/m2). The ploughing layer (30 cm deep) sits on a\nsandy loam\

    \ Flight Parameters, and Field Measurements\nThe UAV–LiDAR system that was utilized\
    \ (i.e., LS Nano M8, LidarSwiss GmbH, CH)\nwas equipped with three built-in devices:\
    \ (i) a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\nreceiver; (ii) an inertial\
    \ measurement unit (IMU) with a mono-antenna navigation system;\nand (iii) a discrete\
    \ LiDAR scanner (M8 sensor, Quanenergy Systems, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA,\nUSA). The\
    \ overall setup allowed for synchronization between the three data streams so\
    \ as\nto produce a georeferenced point cloud dataset output after processing,\
    \ as described in [59].\nThe system was mounted to a commercial DJI Matrice 600\
    \ Pro payload (Figure 3) at a 90°\npitch angle and the same heading and roll angles\
    \ as the UAV platform. The laser-ﬁring\nsystem consisted of a stack of eight lasers,\
    \ which emitted discrete near-infrared pulses (at\n905 nm) in sequence at a constant\
    \ rate of 53 kHz, with an individual beam spacing (along\nthe direction of the\
    \ UAV movement) of 3.20°. The beam divergence was 3 mrad, which\nprovided a footprint\
    \ diameter increase of 3 cm every 10 m along the propagation direction.\nHowever,\
    \ the beam energy was spatially Gaussian distributed [60], which resulted in\n\
    smaller active laser footprints. During data collection, a differential Global\
    \ Positioning\nSystem (dGPS, Trimble R8) was set up as the receiver base station\
    \ in real-time kinematic\n(RTK) positioning mode, which logged real-time corrected\
    \ satellite coverage data during\nthe UAV–LiDAR survey.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 3912\n5 of 22\na\nb\nFigure 3. Instrumentation: (a) the UAV (DJI Matrice 600)\
    \ that was used in this study with the mounted\nLiDAR system; (b) the LiDAR system\
    \ (Nano M8, LidarSwiss GmbH).\nAfter running a number of tests with this instrumentation\
    \ and considering our scanner\nspeciﬁcations with reference to the available literature\
    \ [59], the following LiDAR ﬂight\nparameters were considered for this study:\
    \ a ﬂight height of 40 m above ground level;\na horizontal speed of 5 m/s; a vertical\
    \ ﬁeld of view (FoV) of 21.5°; a horizontal FoV of\n180°; a range gate of 2–200\
    \ m; LiDAR scan swaths of 50 m wide; a side overlap between\nindividual LiDAR\
    \ swaths of 20%; and a scan angle of 0–32°. These parameters provided a\nbalanced\
    \ trade-off between LiDAR penetration through the canopy (i.e., PCD porosity),\n\
    gap fraction, point cloud density (ca. 200 pp/m2), and ﬁeld coverage. The UAV–LiDAR\n\
    surveys followed the calendar and frequency of the AGB sampling campaigns (Figure\
    \ 2a,b),\nwhich resulted in a maximum time difference between the UAV–LiDAR surveys\
    \ and AGB\ncollection of 48 h in case of adverse weather conditions.\nImmediately\
    \ after the UAV–LiDAR surveys, the AGB sampling was carried out. At the\nstudy\
    \ site, scattered georeferenced locations were selected to conduct the AGB collection.\n\
    Several sampling campaigns were conducted each year (six in 2020 and seven in\
    \ 2021). With\nregard to the spatial distribution of the AGB sampling locations\
    \ (Figure 4), the two major\ncampaigns (i.e., on 22 June 2020 and on 14 July 2021)\
    \ utilized randomized sampling, while\nthe rest (i.e., minor campaigns) were conducted\
    \ in areas that showed greater variability.\nAfter the AGB collection, each sample\
    \ was oven-dried for 72 h at 65 °C and weighed\naccording to the reference protocols\
    \ [61]. This procedure was replicated for every sampling\ncampaign over both growing\
    \ seasons. While the procedure that was followed in 2020 was\nused as the baseline\
    \ reference, this AGB collection method was adapted for the 2021 AGB\ncampaigns\
    \ in order to enlarge the AGB reference labeled datasets (Table 1). Further details\n\
    about the datasets are presented in Section 2.4.\n40 m\nFigure 4. The spatial\

    \ Data Processing\nThe steps in the laser data processing pipeline could be divided\
    \ into two parts: (i) point\ncloud scene generation and (ii) point cloud scene\
    \ processing. Lastly, a post-processing step\nwas included to add the phenological\
    \ stage information from each of the datasets.\n2.3.1. Point Cloud Scene Generation\n\
    The raw positioning ﬁle (which was logged by the internal IMU and GNSS during\n\
    the survey) was coupled with the satellite coverage data to produce a processed\
    \ trajectory\nﬁle using NAVsolve software (Oxford Technical Solutions, Bicester,\
    \ UK). We stored the 3D\nposition and UAV attitude data (i.e., longitude, latitude,\
    \ ellipsoidal height, and orientation\nangles) at a 10 Hz sampling resolution.\
    \ Then, in order to ﬁlter out LiDAR data that were\ncompromised due to adverse\
    \ circumstances (e.g., heading deviations that were too large\nor disturbances\
    \ in cruise speed that were caused by wind gusts), the UAV trajectory was\nused\
    \ to mask out the raw laser ﬁles following a quality criterion (∆heading > 25°\
    \ was taken\nas the threshold for the rejection of raw laser data). Finally, the\
    \ processed laser ﬁles were\noutput in parallel swaths, according to the UAV–LiDAR\
    \ survey trajectory plan. In this way,\nseveral parallel swaths produced the full\
    \ PCD scene (Figure 5).\na\nx\ny\nz\nx\ny\nz\nx\nz\ny\nx\nz\ny\nx\nz\ny\nx\nz\n\

    \ cross-sectional views of the PCD, with a buffer depth of 0.5 m. The x (–), y\n\
    (–), and z (–) axes indicate easting, northing, and elevation, respectively. It\
    \ can be seen that there was\na higher PCD porosity in (b) than in (a).\n2.3.2.\
    \ Point Cloud Scene Processing\nAt each location within the PCD scene, a PCD clipping\
    \ was created that covered the\nsame area as each individual AGB sample (i.e.,\
    \ 1 m × 0.35 m in 2020 and 0.5 m × 0.35 m\nin 2021). These clipped areas were\
    \ considered separately (as shown in Figure 6a). Then,\nfor each individual PCD\
    \ clipping, the PCD height value (i.e., ellipsoidal height) was\nnormalized by\
    \ subtracting the terrain height. Finally, we extracted the statistical metrics\
    \ of\nheight and reﬂectance intensity from each individual PCD clipping, which\
    \ were used as\nprediction features.\nIn order to select the prediction features,\
    \ a set of candidate predictors was initially\nshort-listed based on the Pearson\

    \ Post-Processing\nThe data were split into training and validation sets (70%\
    \ and 30%, respectively).\nBoth datasets were then subjected to stratiﬁcation\
    \ [62] to produce separate subgroups\nof instances. This processing step was inspired\
    \ by the three main phenological growth\nstages of crops: (i) “early season”,\
    \ from shoot emergence to the start of stem elongation;\n(ii) “rapid development”,\
    \ from when crops start growing to when they reach their peak\nleaf area index;\
    \ and (iii) “maturity”, when nutrients are allocated to grains and senescence\n\
    occurs [63,64]. Both the training and validation sets were stratiﬁed according\
    \ to the mean\nAGB value from the training distribution using K-means clustering\

    \ grid\nsearch was conducted to optimize the hyperparameters for model selection;\
    \ (b) the ML model with\nthe best performance was ﬁtted to a new dataset (i.e.,\
    \ 70% of either the 2021 barley or wheat datasets)\nand the ﬁnal prediction performance\
    \ was evaluated using the remaining test set (i.e., 30% of the\n2021 datasets).\n\
    2.4. Datasets\nFollowing the aforementioned procedure, three original datasets\
    \ were produced,\nwhich contained AGB- and LiDAR-derived prediction features.\
    \ There was one dataset of\noriginal samples that corresponded to the year 2020\
    \ (barley) and two original datasets that\ncorresponded to the year 2021 (wheat\
    \ and barley). Data were also collected during 2021 so\nas to allow for the production\
    \ of two additional datasets of augmented samples (Figure 6c).\nThe datasets that\
    \ were composed of the augmented samples were produced as follows.\nDuring the\
    \ 2021 AGB collection campaigns, samples were located and collected from\nadjacent\
    \ plots (three samples per location) along the planting line (Figure 6b). In this\
    \ way,\nby adding either two or three original samples, a new augmented instance\
    \ was obtained,\nwhose AGB value was determined by averaging the respective AGB\
    \ values from the\noriginal samples. With regard to the LiDAR-derived metrics\
    \ of the augmented samples,\nthey were re-calculated by considering all of the\
    \ LiDAR returns that were contained in the\noriginal samples. The numbers of instances\
    \ that were included in each dataset, as well as\nthe sample size, are summarized\
    \ in Table 1.\nThe augmented datasets were used to test the model’s ability to\
    \ generalize predictions\nbecause (i) the augmented data samples provided a better\
    \ representation of the vegetation\nstructures of the target plots than the original\
    \ datasets (i.e., as the augmented samples\ncovered a larger area, there was a\
    \ higher count of LiDAR returns per sample) and (ii) the\naugmented datasets had\
    \ a lower sample variance among the AGB labels (because the\nstandard error decreased\
    \ when averaged out over a larger area). These two observations\nwere consistent\
    \ with the fact that the augmented datasets had fewer noisy samples and\nhigher\
    \ correlations between the AGB and the assessed predictors.\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 3912\n9 of 22\n2.5. ML Model Training and Evaluation\nThree different regression\
    \ models were considered. Then, according to their perfor-\nmance using the validation\
    \ set, the most suitable model was selected for testing. The Huber\nregressor\
    \ [67,68] was selected as a representative of the linear methods with regularization.\n\
    This model is a common choice in AGB research due to its robustness to outliers\
    \ [69].\nFurthermore, we employed extremely randomized trees (ERT) [70], which\
    \ is a tree-based\nensemble method. The XGboost regressor [71] was selected as\
    \ a representative of the\nboosting methods.\nIn contrast to the model parameters\
    \ (e.g., the weights that were ﬁtted during the\ntraining phase), the hyperparameters\
    \ (e.g., the deﬁnition of the speciﬁc loss function to\nbe minimized) were external\
    \ to the learning model in question and were pre-deﬁned to\ncontrol the learning\
    \ process [72]. Here, the hyperparameter optimization [73] of the three\nML models\
    \ (Table 2) was conducted using cross-validated grid searches (10 folds) in the\n\
    training set. The barley20 dataset was used for training and validation. The remaining\
    \ four\ndatasets from the 2021 growing season were used for reﬁtting (70%) and\
    \ testing (30%).\nTable 2. A description of the models that were evaluated. The\

    \ results are shown in Section 3.1). The\nselected model was then re-ﬁtted to\

    \ the Selected ML Model\nERT is an ensemble learning technique that aggregates\
    \ the results of multiple individu-\nally created decision trees to produce regression\
    \ results [70]. It was originally derived from\nthe random forest (RF) model [76].\
    \ Every individual predictor, i.e., binary decision tree,\nin an ERT is constructed\
    \ using the whole training set. At each node, a single tree decides\nwhich split\
    \ of a random subset of feature splits would reduce the reconstruction error (e.g.,\n\
    MAE or MSE) the most. The random sampling of features and the random splits within\
    \ the\nfeature ranges lead to diverse and less correlated decision trees. Each\
    \ tree is considered\nto be a “weak” regressor performance-wise but in combination,\
    \ they create an ensemble\nthat can outperform individual regressors. As the ﬁnal\
    \ prediction (AGB in our case), the\naverage of the individual predictions of\
    \ all of the decision trees in the forest is used.\n2.7. Generation of AGB Prediction\
    \ Maps\nThe PCD scenes were subjected to a binary classiﬁcation, which separated\
    \ the ground\nfrom vegetation LiDAR returns.\nFor this purpose, several ﬁltering\
    \ algorithms were\nevaluated [77–79]. The cloth simulation ﬁltering algorithm\
    \ [78] (implemented in R soft-\nware [80]) and the slope-based ﬁlter [77] (implemented\
    \ in Lidar360 software [81]) produced\nthe best results, in contrast to morphological\
    \ ﬁlters [79], which performed poorly. However,\nin order to ensure optimal accuracy,\
    \ the segmentation was completed manually. Next,\nthe ground returns were rasterized\
    \ using the inverse distance weighting algorithm [82,83]\nand then extended to\
    \ the whole region of interest through the interpolation of the natural\nneighbors\
    \ [84] in order to produce a digital terrain model (DTM). The DTM was used to\n\
    normalize the vegetation returns to the ground returns by subtracting the DTM\
    \ height from\nthe initial PCD scene. Based on the spatial distributions of the\
    \ height and reﬂectance of the\nnormalized vegetation returns, a series of LiDAR-derived\
    \ prediction features were mapped\nat a 1 m2 resolution. These prediction feature\
    \ maps were used as the input for the trained\nregression model in order to produce\
    \ the AGB prediction maps (Figure 8).\nAGB (g/m2)\n= AGB prediction map =\n0.0-765\n\

    2.8. Uncertainty of AGB Field-Based Measurements\nThe collection of AGB data is\
    \ often prone to estimation errors [85]. Therefore, account-\ning for the uncertainty\
    \ that is introduced into AGB ﬁeld-based measurements is a necessary\nstep to\
    \ avoid the underestimation of errors in AGB prediction mapping products [86].\
    \ In\nthis study, an additional experiment was dedicated to account for the uncertainty\
    \ that was\nintroduced by the AGB sampling technique and the effects of crop sparsity\
    \ on the AGB\nlabels, which is shown in Appendix A.\n3. Results\n3.1. Model Selection\n\
    The extremely randomized trees (ERT), XGboost, and Huber regression models\n(Table\
    \ 2) were trained using an optimized set of model-speciﬁc hyperparameters (Table\
    \ 3)\nand were evaluated based on their regression performance using the validation\
    \ set, accord-\ning to the MAE, MAPE, RMSE, and R2 metrics. The comparison of\
    \ their performances using\nthe validation set indicated that the ERT model provided\
    \ the most accurate predictions\nacross all four metrics. Figure 9 shows the predictive\
    \ performances of the three considered\nmodels using both the training and validation\
    \ sets. The criterion for model selection was\nthe model performance using the\
    \ validation set, for which ERT achieved the highest R2\nvalue and the lowest\
    \ RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values (note that the Huber model consis-\ntently achieved\
    \ the same performance as it was a deterministic linear model, hence the ﬂat\n\
    boxplot in the ﬁgure). In all four subplots in Figure 9, the horizontal blue and\
    \ green lines\nshow the performance of the linear model that was employed as the\
    \ comparative baseline\nusing the training and validation sets, respectively.\n\

    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912\n12 of 22\nTherefore, ERT was selected for the ﬁnal\
    \ evaluation using the testing sets. The op-\ntimized parameters that were selected\
    \ for the ERT regression model were: mean square\nerror, which was used as the\
    \ criterion to evaluate the quality of a split; the maximum depth\nthat was allowed\
    \ for any individual tree was limited to seven; the sampling was without\nbootstrapping;\
    \ and the maximum number of features to consider per individual tree was\nlimited\
    \ to log2(number of features). Finally, the number of trees was set to 1000 [70].\n\
    3.2. AGB Prediction at a Sub-Meter Resolution\nThe AGB predictions at a 0.35 m2\
    \ spatial resolution that were produced by the ERT\nmodel using the barley and\
    \ wheat testing datasets are shown in Figurse 10a and 11a,\nrespectively. In both\
    \ cases, the results were compared to the linear regression model, which\nwas\
    \ ﬁtted to the same datasets (i.e., ﬁtting to the 70% and predicting the remaining\
    \ 30% of\nthe 2021 data). The predictive performances of this model are shown\
    \ in Figures 10b and 11b\nfor comparison.\nFigure 10. The AGB predictions for\
    \ the barley crops at a 0.35 m2 resolution that were produced\nby the ERT model\

    \ RMSE = 207 g/m2;\nMAE = 162 g/m2; MAPE = 42%); (b) the regression performance\
    \ of the linear model using the testing\ndataset (R2 = 0.1; RMSE = 302 g/m2; MAE\
    \ = 247 g/m2; MAPE = 34%).\nFigure 11. The AGB predictions for the wheat crops\

    \ of the ERT model using the testing dataset (R2 = 0.20; RMSE = 288 g/m2;\nMAE\
    \ = 216 g/m2; MAPE = 23%); (b) the regression performance of the linear model\
    \ (baseline) using\nthe testing dataset (R2 = 0.14; RMSE = 304 g/m2; MAE = 254\
    \ g/m2; MAPE = 33%).\n3.3. Aggregated AGB Predictions\nThe prediction results\
    \ using the testing set were subjected to a resampling technique\n(i.e., random\
    \ sampling with replacement) and aggregated into i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N} samples,\n\
    where i is the number of pairs (AGB prediction vs. AGB target value) that were\
    \ aggregated\nat each step. As shown in Figures 12a and 13a, the mean value of\
    \ the residual distribution\nof the barley and wheat testing datasets approached\
    \ zero. There was a systematic overes-\ntimation of 2% in the wheat testing dataset\
    \ (barley: 2.2 g/m2; wheat: −18.5 g/m2). The\nresiduals were independent and distributed\
    \ around zero, so they were partially canceled\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912\n\
    13 of 22\nout when averaged over a larger area, which caused the R2 score to converge\
    \ to 1 as the\nnumber of aggregate predictions increased (Figures 12b and 13b).\
    \ Thus, the prediction\ncould be improved by coarsening the spatial resolution\
    \ (Table 4). This technique is known\nas the spatial averaging of errors [87].\n\
    By only aggregating two predictions that were randomly sampled for each testing\
    \ set,\nthe AGB results at a 0.7 m2 resolution for both the barley and wheat datasets\
    \ improved\nsigniﬁcantly compared to the respective AGB predictions at a 0.35\
    \ m2 resolution (Table 4\nand Figures 12b and 13b).\nThe R2 score of the aggregate\
    \ predictions presented a turning point between 1 m2\nand 2 m2 of spatial resolution\
    \ (i.e., three and six aggregate samples, respectively), reaching\noptimal predictions\
    \ (R2 ≈ 0.95) from 3 m2 onward for the barley crops (Figure 12b) and\nfrom 4 m2\
    \ onward for the wheat crops (Figure 13b). At 2 m2 of spatial resolution, the\
    \ R2\nreached 0.93 and 0.89 for the barley and wheat testing datasets, respectively\
    \ (Table 4 and\nFigures 12b.1 and 13b.1).\nThe spatial distribution of the AGB\

    4.1. AGB Prediction\nThis study explored a new method to acquire real-time estimates\
    \ of the AGB distri-\nbution in croplands at a sub-meter resolution using UAV–LiDAR\
    \ data and ML regression\nmodels. The results indicated that local variations\
    \ in crop morphology (e.g., crop structure\nand height development) could be captured\
    \ by a close-range UAV–LiDAR survey, thereby\nenabling a regression analysis of\
    \ the AGB. The accuracy that was achieved using the ERT\nmodel was on a par with\
    \ the currently established methods, i.e., multivariate linear re-\ngression and\
    \ power regression models, while attaining resolutions that were one to two\n\
    orders of magnitude higher than those in the reference studies, e.g., Han et al.\
    \ (2.4 m2) [53],\nMa et al. (12 m2) [56] and Zha et al. (160–300 m2) [54].\nFigures\
    \ 10 and 11 show how much the ERT model predictions diverged from the\nideal case\
    \ (i.e., the line of equality) at a 0.35 m2 resolution when predicting AGB for\
    \ the\nsame crop species that was used for training and when predicting AGB for\
    \ a different crop\nspecies, respectively. The ERT regression model achieved valid\
    \ predictions in both case\nand the ERT model predictions outperformed those of\
    \ the linear regression model that was\nused as the comparative baseline (Figures\
    \ 10b and 11b). However, the prediction results\nfor different crop species (i.e.,\
    \ training the model with the barley dataset and predicting\nthe AGB for wheat\
    \ crops) were not as accurate as those for the same species, which was\nexpected.\
    \ The higher accuracy of the predictions for the same crop species also meant\
    \ that\nthe aggregated prediction required fewer aggregated samples to converge\
    \ in the barley set\n(Figure 12b) than in the wheat set (Figure 13b). The performance\
    \ reduction when training\nand predicting for different species could be attributed\
    \ to (i) the different plant-level AGB\ndistributions between the two crop species,\
    \ as captured by the AGB labels (Figure 2), and\n(ii) the different morphology\
    \ in the canopy structures, as portrayed by the LiDAR-derived\npredictors. The\
    \ differences between both crops were retained in the datasets, which caused\n\
    a dataset shift effect [88]. This shift challenged the accuracy of the AGB predictions\
    \ since\nthe joint distributions of the predictors and the target AGB values were\
    \ different for the\ntraining and testing phases.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912\n\
    16 of 22\nRegarding the importance assessment of the selected predictors (i.e.,\
    \ independent\nvariables), care had to be taken when considering predictors that\
    \ had high levels of cor-\nrelation between them, as occurs in LiDAR-derived height\
    \ metrics. It has been observed\nempirically [89,90] and analytically [91] that\
    \ high correlation across prediction features\ncompromises the importance assessment\
    \ in tree-based methods.\nThe predictive features that showed the highest correlations\
    \ with AGB were those\nthat were derived from the height metrics and showed a\
    \ Pearson correlation of between\n0.65–0.71. In contrast, the intensity metrics\
    \ did not correlate consistently with AGB. This\nwas probably due to the low cardinality\
    \ of the intensity range, which prevented the\nproduction of sufﬁciently descriptive\
    \ features.\nWith regard to phenology, the barley dataset that was collected over\
    \ an extended time\nperiod in 2020 covered different crop development phases and\
    \ presented higher correlation\ncoefﬁcients between height-related predictors\
    \ and AGB compared to the barley dataset\nthat was collected in 2021, which did\
    \ not cover all of the phases of vegetation growth.\nThe results showed that it\
    \ was especially important to use datasets that covered different\nphases of vegetation\
    \ development to train the models for AGB predictions in order for\nthe regression\
    \ models to learn the relationships between the predictive features and the\n\
    target values. However, once a model was adequately trained, it could predict\
    \ AGB using\ndatasets that were collected during “snapshot surveys” (i.e., data\
    \ acquisition campaigns\nthat were conducted in one single day), such as the barley21)\
    \ dataset.\nWhen considering vegetation structure, it was observed that open canopies\
    \ and\nheterogeneous crop patterns were morphological characteristics that compromised\
    \ the use\nof LiDAR-derived height metrics as predictors of AGB. Plots that were\
    \ surrounded by\nsparse vegetation were commonly reached by LiDAR beams at lower\
    \ heights than plots in\ndenser areas, thus distorting the relationships between\
    \ the AGB and height metrics.\nAdditionally, increased variations in the AGB labels\
    \ could enlarge the training domain,\nwhich favored the regression model’s ability\
    \ to interpolate predictions using the testing\nset [92]. Likewise, more variability\
    \ in the prediction features could make them more\ndescriptive and, therefore,\
    \ better at capturing the morphological traits of the crops (e.g.,\nattaining\
    \ a better portrayal of stem density and canopy structure).\n4.2. Aggregation\
    \ of AGB Predictions\nIt was notable that AGB predictions with signiﬁcantly higher\
    \ accuracies could be\nachieved using slightly coarser spatial resolutions (Figures\
    \ 12 and 13). The aggregation\nimproved the model’s predictions considerably by\
    \ only adding two instances (i.e., at a\nspatial resolution of 0.7 m2), while\
    \ the 1 m2 resolution was found to be the optimal trade-\noff between spatial\
    \ resolution and prediction performance for capturing local variations\nin AGB\
    \ (Table 4 and Figures 12b.1 and 13b.1). In terms of the sampling resolution,\
    \ the\ndatasets that were composed of smaller samples (i.e., 0.5 m × 0.34 m) showed\
    \ lower\ncorrelations between the height-related predictors and AGB than the same\
    \ datasets after the\naggregation of two or three samples (1 m × 0.34 m and 1.5\
    \ m × 0.34 m, respectively). The\nAGB samples with a very high spatial resolution\
    \ (e.g., 0.175 m2) could suffer from poor PCD\nrepresentation (i.e., low counts\
    \ of LiDAR returns), thereby compromising the reliability\nof the statistics that\
    \ were extracted. Additionally, the datasets that had small sample sizes\npresented\
    \ higher variance in the AGB ground truth values (i.e., the measurements at a\n\
    0.175 m2 resolution produced noisier labels).\n4.3. Applied ML Methods\nAlthough\
    \ we considered different ML methods, it was not our intention to system-\natically\
    \ compare the performances of a series of ML models to ﬁnd the lowest possible\n\
    error rate since the experimental design of this study did not allow for such\
    \ comparisons.\nOnly relatively few training instances were available and the\
    \ target AGB values had a high\nvariance (Figure 2a,b). Instead, we aimed to test\
    \ an ML regression method that utilized\nfeatures that were derived from point\
    \ cloud data that represented the structures of crop\ncanopies to predict AGB,\
    \ taking into account the aforementioned limitations. The suggested\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 3912\n17 of 22\nmethod consisted of selecting one representative model\
    \ per family of methods (Table 2) and\nthe set of parameters (Table 3) that performed\
    \ the best using the validation set, followed by\nre-ﬁtting the selected model\
    \ (i.e., ERT) to an unseen dataset that was collected the following\nyear (Figure\
    \ 7). As such, the selection of a speciﬁc ML model was not relevant in this case.\n\
    Indeed, by exploring extended parameter sets, one model could slightly outperform\
    \ the\nothers for individual predictions or a different model could perform better\
    \ using datasets\nfrom subsequent years or another crop type. Achieving greater\
    \ accuracy and predicting\nAGB at higher spatial resolutions would require more\
    \ training data that are representative\nof different growing conditions and collected\
    \ in a protocolized manner using both AGB\nlabels and PCD scenes in order to achieve\
    \ AGB predictions that are robust to inter-annual\nand inter-species variations\
    \ (e.g., crop structure, weather conditions, different crops, etc.).\n5. Conclusions\n\
    In this study, we developed a method that combines UAV–LiDAR surveys and ML\n\
    techniques to predict the above-ground biomass of standing vegetation for cereal\
    \ crops at\nsub-meter resolutions. This method was developed and tested for two\
    \ crop species at the\nsame ﬁeld site over two consecutive growing seasons: winter\
    \ wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\nand barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The ERT model\
    \ performed real-time AGB estimation,\ntaking as its input the height and intensity\
    \ metrics that were derived from the point cloud\ndata scene, and achieved a prediction\
    \ performance of R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 207 g, MAE = 162 g,\nand MAPE = 42% at a spatial\
    \ resolution of 0.35 m2. However, by aggregating the individual\npredictions,\
    \ it was observed that the prediction performance could be increased signiﬁcantly\n\
    by coarsening the spatial resolution as the predictions were statistically independent\
    \ and\nuncorrelated. At a spatial resolution of 2 m2, the regression performance\
    \ achieved R2 = 0.93,\nRMSE = 300 g/m2, MAE = 266 g/m2, and MAPE = 13% when the\
    \ training and testing\ndatasets corresponded to the same crop species. The aggregated\
    \ AGB predictions also\nachieved reasonable results at a 2 m2 spatial resolution\
    \ when the model was trained on\none crop type and tested on another: R2 = 0.89,\
    \ RMSE = 400 g/m2, MAE = 351 g/m2, and\nMAPE = 16%. This slight reduction in the\
    \ prediction performance was explained by the\ndifferences between (i) the canopy\
    \ structures and (ii) the plant-level biomass distributions\nof the two crop species\
    \ under consideration. We encourage the continuation of protocolized\nﬁeld-based\
    \ data collection campaigns, as well as UAV–LiDAR surveying, as a means to gain\n\
    valuable data that are representative of crops under different environmental conditions\
    \ in\norder to develop AGB regression models that are capable of generalizing\
    \ predictions that\nare even more robust to inter-annual and inter-species variations.\n\
    More precise AGB estimates allow for real-time evaluations of crop yields, thereby\n\
    enabling adaptive management practices (such as adjusting harvest dates according\
    \ to\nmill capacity) and estimated production, as well as improving early warning\
    \ systems\nfor food security in climate-vulnerable regions. The method that was\
    \ introduced here\nfor acquiring real-time AGB estimates for croplands using UAV–LiDAR\
    \ surveys and ML\nsupervised regression models could pave the way for future studies\
    \ on predicting the\nspatial distributions of AGB-related biochemical constituents\
    \ at sub-meter resolutions by\napplying this method throughout vegetation growth\
    \ periods for precision agriculture and\nagroecological applications. This quantitative\
    \ method could also assist in management\ndecision-making. Finally, this line\
    \ of research could help to narrow down the margins of\nuncertainty that are still\
    \ present in the estimates of current above-ground carbon stocks\nand C-turnover\
    \ values at the ecosystem level, for example.\nAuthor Contributions:\nOriginal\

    \ sparsity on the uncertainty that was contained\nin the AGB labels, we collected\
    \ 180 samples from 10 different locations of 1 m2 each (see\nFigure A1). This\
    \ extra study contrasted with the main ﬁeld study, for which sub-meter\nsamples\
    \ were taken exclusively. To calculate the variance, each of the 18 sub-meter\
    \ samples\nwas upscaled to g/m2 and then subtracted from the total AGB in the\
    \ 1 m2 that was measured\nat each location. Due to oven capacity limitations,\
    \ this analysis was conducted with wet\nAGB, assuming that the variations in water\
    \ content within 1 m2 would be negligible. A\nhigher variance was found in the\
    \ datasets that were composed of samples with higher\nspatial resolutions (i.e.,\
    \ the 2021 datasets) and within those, it was substantially higher for\ncrops\
    \ with higher sparsity (i.e., wheat) than for the more homogeneous crops (i.e.,\
    \ barley),\nas was expected.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3912\n19 of 22\n        \

  limitations: The study was limited to two crop species (winter wheat and barley)
    and two consecutive growing seasons. It is not clear how well the method would
    perform for other crop species or for different environmental conditions. Additionally,
    the study did not consider the uncertainty that is introduced into AGB field-based
    measurements, which can be a significant source of error in AGB prediction mapping
    products.

  verbatim_quote1: The ERT model performed real-time AGB estimation, taking as its
    input the height and intensity metrics that were derived from the point cloud
    data scene, and achieved a prediction performance of R² = 0.48, RMSE = 207 g,
    MAE = 162 g, and MAPE = 42% at a spatial resolution of 0.35 m².
  verbatim_quote2: However, by aggregating the individual predictions, it was observed
    that the prediction performance could be increased signiﬁcantly by coarsening
    the spatial resolution as the predictions were statistically independent and uncorrelated.
    At a spatial resolution of 2 m², the regression performance achieved R² = 0.93,
    RMSE = 300 g/m2, MAE = 266 g/m2, and MAPE = 13% when the training and testing
    datasets corresponded to the same crop species.

  analysis: "This study is one of the first applications of the UAV technology for\
    \ the geometrical canopy characterization of Corylus avellana L. The use of this\
    \ technique for precision agriculture has a broad range of applications in estimating\
    \ the geometrical parameters of hazelnut canopy, such as canopy radius and height,\
    \ height of tree and trunk. A UAV with a multispectral camera was used to acquire\
    \ images of hazelnut trees, which were then processed to create a 3D point cloud.\
    \ Two different methods were used to calculate the canopy volume, and the performance\
    \ of the method was evaluated by comparing manual and UAV data using the Pearson\
    \ correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE). High correlation\
    \ values were obtained for parameters Rc, hc and htree, while a very low correlation\
    \ was obtained for htrunk. \n\nThe method proposed for the volume calculation\
    \ was promising. The good accuracy obtained via the proposed methods ensures the\
    \ suitability of this procedure for an accurate measurement of the canopy volume.\
    \ From the UAV images, the geometric characteristics of the hazelnut canopy were\
    \ obtained with good accuracy. The volume estimation was slightly overestimated\
    \ for both the UAV methods, and more so for higher tree densities. This may be\
    \ due to the fact that the DSMcanopy was not totally free of sparse vegetation\
    \ growing on the ground between the trees.\n\nThis study revealed that the hazelnut\
    \ canopy size and volume derived by the UAV method were close to those obtained\
    \ via manual delineation and field measurement. The UAV method could replace field\
    \ measurement to achieve signiﬁcant labour savings. Moreover, using the UAV method,\
    \ a large amount of information can be extracted (tree height; volume, thickness,\
    \ and width of the canopy), whereas traditional on-ground observation of the same\
    \ ﬁeld would require much more time and effort. In addition, this study showed\
    \ high correlations between the measurements of the main plant characteristics,\
    \ such as canopy volume, between the UAV and manual measurements.\n\nFinally,\
    \ the present study has developed two methods for calculating the volume of a\
    \ hazelnut canopy. In one method, the canopy is assimilated into a cylinder, and\
    \ the measurements are well correlated with the manual ones. In the other, however,\
    \ the canopy is well deﬁned in its shape. It, therefore, provides more precise\
    \ information on the management of the tree, e.g., the intensity of annual pruning\
    \ or vegetative growth. The results presented here could beneﬁt growers and the\
    \ scientiﬁc community working on management practices in hazelnut orchards. For\
    \ example, such methods can be crucial when deciding on the variable rate of chemical\
    \ or irrigation applications."

    \ for the precision management of a hazelnut\norchard. In fact, it has been shown\
    \ that site-speciﬁc crop management allows for the best possible\nmanagement and\
    \ efﬁciency of the use of inputs. Generally, measurements of tree parameters are\n\
    carried out using manual techniques that are time-consuming, labor-intensive and\
    \ not very precise.\nThe aim of this study was to propose, evaluate and validate\
    \ a simple and innovative procedure using\nimages acquired by an unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle (UAV) for canopy characterization in an intensive\nhazelnut orchard.\
    \ The parameters considered were the radius (Rc), the height of the canopy (hc),\
    \ the\nheight of the tree (htree) and of the trunk (htrunk). Two different methods\
    \ were used for the assessment\nof the canopy volume using the UAV images. The\
    \ performance of the method was evaluated by\ncomparing manual and UAV data using\
    \ the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient and root mean square\nerror (RMSE). High\
    \ correlation values were obtained for Rc, hc and htree while a very low correlation\n\
    was obtained for htrunk. The method proposed for the volume calculation was promising.\n\

    \ orchard\n1. Introduction\nThe European hazelnut tree (Corylus avellana L.) is\
    \ distributed in the temperate zone of\nthe northern hemisphere but is spreading\
    \ rapidly in new areas such as Chile, South Africa,\nand Australia. Its total\
    \ cultivated area in the world is about 660,000 ha, with an average\nworld annual\
    \ production of about 865,000 t (in-shell hazelnuts), showing an increasing trend\n\
    of geographical expansion caused by strong demand from the confectionery industry\
    \ [1,2].\nHazelnut traditionally grows as a multi-stemmed bush with a planting\
    \ density of between\n250 and 550 trees/ha [3,4]. On the contrary, new hazelnut\
    \ orchards are designed with higher\nplanting densities of up to 1700 trees/ha;\
    \ drip or sub-irrigation; a free vase training system;\nand a single trunk, allowing\
    \ for mechanical cultivation. Traditional orchard management\nmethods have a low\
    \ degree of informatization, leading to various problems, including\nlow production\
    \ efﬁciency, excessive water/fertilizer/pesticide use and severe pollution\nproblems.\
    \ In addition, modern orchard management will be empowered by informatization,\n\
    which will provide opportunities for growers to make decisions based on facts,\
    \ and help\nthem to reproduce good practices [5,6].\nIt is known that the development\
    \ of the tree canopy affects both the quality and\nyield of fruits [7–9]; therefore,\
    \ to achieve high hazelnut production, manipulation and\nmanagement of the tree\
    \ canopy are essential. Due to the increasing price of agrochemicals,\nagricultural\
    \ diesel, water and labor, there is a need for efﬁcient precision farming that\n\
    applies the appropriate timing and amount of fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation\

    Precision agriculture, especially for fruit tree crops, is an environmental and\
    \ economic\nmanagement strategy that uses information and communication technology\
    \ to acquire data\nsupporting decisions in climate change [10–12]. The preliminary\
    \ step of precision farming\nis receiving as much growth data on the crop as possible,\
    \ which depends on accurately\ndescribing the crop’s morphological and structural\
    \ characteristics, including canopy width,\nheight, area and volume [7,13]. Among\
    \ these, canopy width is essential for precision spray-\ning and machine harvesting,\
    \ while the canopy projection area is important for determining\ntree growth and\
    \ water requirements during the growing season [7]. Moreover, geometrical\ncanopy\
    \ characteristics and tree vigor are crucial traits in phenotyping studies to\
    \ assess the\ncultivar’s suitability to be cultivated in speciﬁc growing systems,\
    \ as well as for evaluating\npruning practices, irrigation and fertilization,\
    \ and spraying [5,14].\nWith the development of sensor technology, nondestructive\
    \ large-area orchard canopy\nmeasurement can be realized using unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAVs) and visual imaging\ntechnology [5,8]. A UAV is a powered, aerial\
    \ vehicle, without any human operator, that\ncan ﬂy autonomously or be controlled\
    \ remotely with various payloads. Furthermore, due\nto their advantages in terms\
    \ of ﬂexible data acquisition and high spatial resolution, UAVs\nare quickly evolving\
    \ and provide a powerful technical approach that is rapid and nonde-\nstructive,\
    \ for many applications in precision agriculture, including crop-state mapping,\n\
    crop-yield prediction, disease detection, and weed management [15].\nA UAV with\
    \ low-altitude remote sensing has advantages such as good mobility, easy\nconstruction,\
    \ and high resolution for obtaining images. These UAVs are easily accessible\n\
    and provide accurate data. Furthermore, they are cost-effective, easy to deploy\
    \ anywhere\nand can produce real-time spatial images compared with other traditional\
    \ remote sensing\n(RS) platforms. However, the use of UAVs in precision agriculture\
    \ faces critical challenges\nsuch as payload, the sensors used in the UAV, the\
    \ cost of the UAV, ﬂight duration, data\nanalytics, environmental conditions,\
    \ and other requirements. Cost is the main challenge\nto UAV use due to the various\
    \ sensors, mounting parts, technology-based applications\nand software needed\
    \ for data analytics. Weather conditions, such as rain, snowfall, clouds,\nand\
    \ fog, are another factor that limits UAV activities and the sensing process.\
    \ A recent\nstudy showed how [14] the quality of services provided by UAVs in\
    \ comparison to other\ntypes of remote sensing platforms, such as satellites,\
    \ manned aircrafts and ground-based\nplatforms, resulted in higher ﬂexibility,\
    \ adaptability and accuracy, with easy deployment\nand operability [16]. One other\
    \ limitation of multi rotor UAVs is battery duration, although\nthis enables UAVs\
    \ to be small- to medium-sized [6]. Several studies have been conducted on\nthe\
    \ use of UAV sensing technology in various types of orchards [17], including olive\
    \ [14,18],\npeach [7], almond [19], apple [20], mango [21], grape [22,23], cherry\
    \ [24] and pine [25]\norchards, with promising results. In the last decade, research\
    \ on hazelnuts has focused on\nthe improvement of ﬁeld management and the quality\
    \ of products; however, techniques\nare lagging behind advanced agronomic practices\
    \ [1,6,26].\nFrom the ﬁrst studies before the new century [27] up to the very\
    \ recent H2020 Panteon\nproject, various authors have tried their hand at modern\
    \ data collection techniques [28–30].\nThese studies mainly focused on using satellite\
    \ remote sensing images for the investigation\nof the land characteristics of\
    \ hazelnut orchards. Moreover, the resolution of satellite images\nis not often\
    \ sufﬁcient to highlight spatial variability because of different types of soil\
    \ tillage\nand canopy management practices that can invalidate the canopy vigor\
    \ data, as has already\nbeen reported for other tree crops [19].\nDespite this,\
    \ research works involving the use of environmental remote sensing\nsystems are\
    \ very few: the review of Zhang et al. [17] reports no published paper on the\n\
    use of UAVs in Corylus avellana L. Altieri et al. [6] recently deﬁned a rapid\
    \ procedure to\ncalculate the canopy area and leaf area index (LAI) of young hazelnut\
    \ trees using NDVI\n(normal difference vegetation index) and CHM (canopy height\
    \ model) values derived from\nUAV images. However, they did not report geometric\
    \ information such as canopy width.\nHazelnut has particular characteristics both\
    \ for the canopies, which have irregular\nand complex shapes, and for the high\
    \ leaf area index (LAI) [6] that challenge their 3D\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 541\n\
    3 of 16\ncharacterization. Therefore, it is important to improve the characterization\
    \ of this tree crop. In\naddition, in recent years this species has shown an increasing\
    \ trend of geographical expansion\ncaused by strong demand from the confectionery\
    \ industry, with the plantation of modern, big,\nmechanically manageable, irrigated,\
    \ and high-density orchards. This led to the necessity to\nadapt the principles\
    \ of precision farming also to Corylus avellana L. Overall, there is still a lack\n\
    of methodological information on how to use the UAV’s data to make accurate measurements\n\
    of the geometrical characteristics and the volume of hazelnut canopy. Meanwhile,\
    \ there is a\nlack of assessment on time and labor consumption associated with\
    \ efforts to enhance accuracy\nwith the UAV photogrammetry method. Accordingly,\
    \ the general aim of this paper was\nto give to researchers and growers an innovative\
    \ and simple method for the punctual and\ncomplete characterization of the hazelnut\
    \ canopy by UAV photogrammetry.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Site Description\
    \ and Tree Sampling\nThe research was carried out during the growing season of\
    \ 2022 in the experimental\norchard of the Department of Agricultural, Food, and\
    \ Environmental Sciences of the\nUniversity of Perugia, located in central Italy\
    \ (42◦58′22.82′′N, 12◦24′13.02′′E) on an orchard\nplanted in 2017 with three densities:\n\
    (A)\n625 trees ha−1, spaced 4 m between rows and 4 m on the row, used as a control\n\
    treatment—the common density used by farmers;\n(B)\n1250 trees ha−1, spaced 4\
    \ m × 2 m;\n(C)\n2500 trees ha−1, spaced 4 m × 1 m.\nAll trees, grafted on no-suckering\
    \ rootstock, were trained as single trunks with four\nmain branches each.\nThe\
    \ orchard is composed of six rows, each containing 43 trees divided into the three\n\
    densities of the plantation; on the same row, the ﬁrst 25 plants are spaced 1\
    \ m from each\nother, the next 12 are spaced 2 m and the last 6 are placed 4 m\
    \ apart. Speciﬁcally, the\norchard is made up of trees belonging to two of the\
    \ main Italian hazelnut varieties: Tonda\ndi Giffoni in the ﬁrst three rows and\
    \ Tonda Francescana® in the next three rows. In this\npaper, the trees studied\
    \ belonged only to the hazelnut variety Tonda Francescana®.\nA previous study\
    \ showed that hazelnut canopy characterization by UAV was unsuit-\nable for the\
    \ third plant density reported above, namely 2500 trees ha−1 [31]. For this reason,\n\
    later research was carried out only on the ﬁrst two plant densities of the hazelnut\
    \ orchard.\n2.2. Manual Measurements\nManual measurements have been carried out\
    \ on 36 trees, 12 per each row, of which\n6 had a 1250 trees ha−1 density and\
    \ the other 6 a 625 trees ha−1 density. Since the studied\ntrees are replicated\
    \ in three rows, 18 trees were measured for each of the two tree densities.\n\
    Manual measurements were used to characterize tree hazelnut canopy parameters\n\
    such as plant height and canopy volume. Speciﬁcally, the instrument used to obtain\
    \ the\nparameters was a meter measure, which was used to measure the plant height,\
    \ canopy\nheight, width, and thickness. The tree height, trunk and canopy height\
    \ and canopy width\nand thickness were measured by a trained operator standing\
    \ in front of the plant, collecting\na single measurement per parameter. The canopy\
    \ size parameters, measured manually,\nrepresent the mean value of the canopy,\
    \ derived from a single measure per size parameter.\nIn detail, the canopy’s height\
    \ was calculated as the difference between the plant’s height\nand the trunk’s\
    \ height, while the width and thickness of the canopy were measured as the\naverage\
    \ distance between the sides. The width is considered the average distance between\n\
    the north and south sides of the canopy; on the contrary, the thickness is measured\
    \ between\nthe west and the east sides. The width and thickness of the canopy\
    \ were used to calculate\nthe average radius of the canopy area, assimilated to\
    \ a regular circle and, with the height of\nthe canopy, was used to calculate\
    \ its volume, which was assimilated to a simple cylinder,\naccording to what the\
    \ report by [32], as if the plant shape was a regular geometric solid.\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2023, 15, 541\n4 of 16\n2.3. Acquisition of UAV Images\nThe acquisition\
    \ was made using a DJI (Shenzhen, China) Phantom 4 (P4) Multispectral\nUAV [33].\
    \ The P4 multispectral is a high-precision drone capable of multispectral imaging\n\
    functions. The imaging system contains six cameras with 1⁄2.9-inch CMOS (complementary\n\
    metal–oxide semiconductor) sensors, including a Red–Green Blue (RGB) camera and\
    \ a\nmultispectral camera array containing ﬁve cameras for multispectral imaging,\
    \ covering\nthe following bands: blue (B): 450 nm ± 16 nm; green (G): 560 nm ±\
    \ 16 nm; red (R):\n650 nm ± 16 nm; red edge (RE): 730 nm ± 16 nm and near-infrared\
    \ (NIR): 840 nm ± 26 nm.\nThe spectral sunlight sensor on the top of the aircraft\
    \ detects solar irradiance in real time for\nimage compensation, maximizing the\
    \ accuracy of the collected multispectral data. The P4\nMultispectral uses a global\
    \ shutter to avoid distortions that might be present when using a\nrolling shutter.\n\
    The P4 multispectral aircraft has a built-in DJI Onboard D-RTK, providing high-\n\
    precision data for centimeter-level positioning when used with a Network RTK service.\n\
    The P4 multispectral has a maximum take-off weight of 1487 g, and a maximum speed\
    \ of\n31 mph or 36 mph (based on the ﬂight mode). The controllable range of the\
    \ pitch angle\nis −90◦ to +30◦. The app DJI GSPro, installed on an Apple iPad,\
    \ was used for the design\nand execution of the UAV ﬂight. The ﬂight plan was\
    \ designed as a polygon grid with a\nﬂight altitude of 10 m, an overlap of the\
    \ ﬂight path of 75% in both the side and heading\ndirections, a velocity of 1.5–2\
    \ m/s and the capture mode “Hover & Capture at Point”. The\nground resolution\
    \ (GSD—ground sample distance) was set to 0.5 cm/pixels.\nGround control points\
    \ (GCPs) were used to ensure the accuracy of the subsequent\npoint cloud information.\
    \ The coordinates of the GCPs were measured using network\nreal time kinematic\
    \ (NRTK) Positioning, so the position of the receiver points on global\nnavigation\
    \ satellite system (GNSS) is obtained in real time with centimeter precision.\
    \ On\nthe ﬁeld were also positioned check points (CPs), i.e., known coordinate\
    \ points, not used\nfor the point cloud model but only for position control. The\
    \ position of the GCPs and CPs\nis reported in Figure 1a.\nRemote Sens. 2023,\

    \ procedure of Agisoft Metashape. \nEach point cloud was exported separately to\
    \ the open-source software Cloud \nCompare (Paris, France). In Figure 2a, the\
    \ “canopy” point cloud exported on Cloud \nCompare was reported. The obtained\
    \ 3D point cloud is affected by noise, especially \nin the lower part of the canopy.\
    \ Thus, filters available on Cloud Compare software \nFigure 1. (a) Distribution\

    \ orientation of the frames was determined by aerial triangulation\nwith a bundle\
    \ adjustment algorithm. The tie points of the frames were automatically identified\n\
    using an image-matching algorithm. The GCPs, whose coordinates were known from\
    \ the\nGNSS survey, were manually identified on the frames, and collimated one\
    \ by one [34].\n2.4. Point Cloud Reconstruction\nAgisoft (St. Petersburg, Russia)\
    \ Metashape software [35] was used to process the UAV\nimages. The software easily\
    \ and automatically converts hundreds of images into a point\ncloud. It is widely\
    \ used for ground and aerial photogrammetry and remote sensing [36–39].\nThe red-green-blue\
    \ (RGB) images collected by the UAV were used to create the 3D point\ncloud (Figure\
    \ 1b). The detailed procedure used to obtain the point cloud is described in [36].\n\
    Brieﬂy, the calibration procedure was ﬁrst applied to calculate the calibration\
    \ camera\nparameters and the obtained parameters were imported to Agisoft Metashape\
    \ before\nprocessing. Metashape was used to ﬁnd matching points between overlapping\
    \ images,\nestimate the camera position, and build a sparse and dense point cloud\
    \ model [36]. As\ndescribed above, 10 GCPs (Figure 1a,b) were used for orienting\
    \ the images during the\noptimisation and for georeferencing the photogrammetric\
    \ model and point cloud in the\nglobal datum WGS 84. An ortophoto of the study\
    \ area was extracted (Figure 1a).\n2.5. Recognition of Hazelnut Trees\nFor the\
    \ identiﬁcation of every single tree, two procedures were tested:\n1.\nThe 3D\
    \ point cloud was divided into two point clouds: a “canopy” point cloud and a\n\
    “ground” point cloud, using the classiﬁcation procedure of Agisoft Metashape.\
    \ Each\npoint cloud was exported separately to the open-source software Cloud\
    \ Compare\n(Paris, France). In Figure 2a, the “canopy” point cloud exported on\
    \ Cloud Compare\nwas reported. The obtained 3D point cloud is affected by noise,\
    \ especially in the lower\npart of the canopy. Thus, ﬁlters available on Cloud\
    \ Compare software for automatic\nnoise removal have been used. Rasterisation\
    \ of the “canopy” and ”ground” point\nclouds was done, resulting in Digital Surface\
    \ Model (DSM) DSMcanopy and DSMground,\nrespectively, with a resolution of 0.01\
    \ m × 0.01 m. To the DSMcanopy no interpolation\nto ﬁll empty areas was performed\
    \ because the holes could represent essential data\nfor the evaluation of the\
    \ penetration of the light through the canopy; instead, to the\nDSMground a weighted\
    \ average interpolation was applied to ﬁll some holes in the\noriginal cloud.\
    \ Finally, the two DSMs were imported into QGis (Figure 2b) to operate\nthe analysis\
    \ described below.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n6 of 18\n \ninstead,\

    \ the shape of the canopy obtained from the 3D point cloud (method 2).\n•\nMethod\
    \ 2: the volume was evaluated considering the shape of the canopy obtained\nfrom\
    \ the 3D point cloud (Figure 5b). From the raster ﬁle of the canopy, DSMcanopy,\
    \ the\nvolume was obtained in a GIS environment by evaluating the volume between\

    2.7. Evaluation of Model Accuracy\nTwo indicators evaluate the accuracy of the\
    \ model in this study: the Pearson correlation\ncoefﬁcient (R) and the root mean\
    \ square error (RMSE). R represents a measure of linear\ncorrelation between two\
    \ sets of data and has a value between −1 (a perfect negative\ncorrelation) and\
    \ 1 (a perfect positive correlation), where 0 indicates no correlation. The\n\
    RMSE represents the deviation of the predicted value from the actual value, i.e.,\
    \ the\ncloser the calculated value of the volumetric algorithm is to the true\
    \ value of the manual\nmeasurement, the higher the prediction accuracy of the\
    \ model. The calculation equation is\nas follows:\nRMSE =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\nN·\n\
    N\n∑\ni=1\n(Yi − Xi)2\n(6)\nwhere Yi is the sample predicted value (in this case\
    \ corresponding to UAV data), Xi is the sample\nactual value (corresponding to\
    \ manual measurements) and N is the number of samples.\n3. Results\n3.1. Assessing\
    \ Errors of the Point Cloud Reconstruction\nFor the UAV survey 23 points of known\
    \ location, including 10 GCPs and 13 CPs, were\nused. The total error was evaluated\
    \ by both GCPs and CPs and was lower than 0.02 m\n(Total Error Control Points:\
    \ 0.0173 m; Check Points: 0.0193 m).\nTable 1 shows the GCPs/CPs location, Root\
    \ Mean Square Error for X, Y, and Z coordi-\nnates (Error-m) and Root Mean Square\
    \ Error for X, Y coordinates (Error-pixel) for GCPs\nand CP averaged over all\
    \ the images. The total error implies averaging over all the GCP\nlocations/check\
    \ points.\n3.2. Recognition of Hazelnut Trees\nFigure 6a gives the NDVI map obtained\
    \ using a threshold NDVI = 0.3. The black\npixels corresponding to NDVI > 0.3\
    \ represent vegetation; the white pixels corresponding\nto NDVI < 0.3 represent\
    \ no vegetation. From this map (Figure 6a), it is not possible to\nextract the\
    \ single tree canopy due to the presence of sparse vegetation on the ground. To\n\
    exclude the sparse vegetation from the analysis, the threshold was increased to\

    \ = 0.841) and high for Rc (R = 0.765)\nand hc (R = 0.508), but low and negative\
    \ for htrunk (R = −0.117); low values were obtained\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 541\n\
    13 of 16\nfor RMSE, i.e., RMSE = 0.130 m, RMSE = 0.281 m, RMSE = 0.186 m, RMSE\
    \ = 0.208 m for\nRc, hc, htree, and htrunk respectively. For 1250 trees/ha, the\
    \ Pearson correlation coefficient\nwas lower for all the characteristics Rc, hc,\
    \ htree, and htrunk (R = 0.545, R = 0.348, R = 0.340,\nR = 0.245); the RMSE was\
    \ low for Rc (RMSE = 0.099 m) and not high for the other parameters,\ni.e., RMSE\
    \ = 0.283 m, RMSE = 0.267 m, RMSE = 0.155 m for hc, htree, and htrunk, respectively.\n\
    The canopy volumes calculated by UAV and manual measurements could be analysed\n\
    for the density of the plantation. In this case, a high Pearson correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ was\nfound (R = 0.805) for a density of 625 trees/ha and a not-high Pearson\
    \ correlation coefﬁ-\ncient (R = 0.610) for a density of 1250 trees/ha. The RMSE\
    \ was 1.630 m for a density of\n625 trees/ha and 1.836 m for a density of 1250\
    \ trees/ha.\n4. Discussion\nThis study has presented a UAV image analysis method\
    \ for accurate and efﬁcient\ndetermination of canopy size and volume of hazelnut\
    \ trees and evaluated its accuracy\nagainst ﬁeld measurements. The correlation\
    \ values were always positive, indicating a fair\ngeneral agreement among the\
    \ geometric characteristics in the description of the structure\nof the canopy.\
    \ The geometrical parameter most correlated with the manual one was htree\n(R\
    \ = 0.841) followed by Rc (R = 0.765) and hc (R = 0.508), in agreement with what\
    \ was\nmeasured by [5]. These results are better than those obtained for blueberry\
    \ bushes, where\nthe canopy size derived from imagery only achieved a moderate\
    \ correlation with manual\nmeasurements, mainly due to the occlusion of the canopy\
    \ by the bush canopy [42]. The\nUAV method allows for reaching a high level of\
    \ detail for every hazelnut tree reconstruction,\nin agreement with what was obtained\
    \ for almond trees [20].\nAccording to the results reported by [42] for Citrus\
    \ reticulata, trees were easily obscured\nby the branches and leaves of adjacent\
    \ trees during UAV tilt photogrammetry, resulting in\nthe occlusion of the lower\
    \ part of the trees. This situation can explain the lack of correlation\nfor the\
    \ parameter htrunk reported between UAV and manual measurements in this study.\n\
    This problem could be overcome by using, e.g., a multiparameter sensor mounted\
    \ on an\nagricultural tractor, as already performed in intensive olive orchards\
    \ by [43].\nThe reconstruction of the experimental site in a 3D model conﬁrmed\
    \ the suitability of\nusing UAVs for monitoring the canopy characteristics of\
    \ hazelnut orchards. The elevation\ninformation obtained from the point cloud\
    \ allowed for better recognition of the canopy\ncharacteristics, excluding pixels\
    \ representing the ground and incorrectly classiﬁed as\nbelonging to the canopy\
    \ from the NDVI map. These results agree with those of [18], who\nreported that\
    \ the use of the NDVI index for tree canopy delineation in olives was not\neffective.\
    \ Although adult olive trees could be classiﬁed, tree canopy delineation was not\n\
    possible because of the differing shape of the canopy, the mix with other types\
    \ of vegetation\nand/or even the trees’ shadows. In this paper, contrary to [6],\
    \ the altimetric information\nof the canopy (DSMcanopy) was available because\
    \ the point cloud was ﬁltered into two\npoint clouds, one for the canopy and one\
    \ for the ground. In cases where it is not possible\nto know the difference between\
    \ the canopy and the ground (for example, for extensive or\nheterogeneous slope\
    \ areas), the intersections between the complete DSM (canopy + ground)\nand the\
    \ NDVI map must be ﬁltered using an elevation threshold (for example, the mean\
    \ or\nminimum height of the trunk).\nAccording to [44], UAV photogrammetry resulted\
    \ in obtaining, quickly and conveniently,\nsuitable images of a tree (in this\
    \ case, hazelnuts). This research is evidence that, to successfully\ndetermine\
    \ the canopy from a NDVI map, the soil below adult hazelnut trees should be\n\
    completely free of grass to avoid interference. Regarding the determination of\
    \ the canopy\nvolume of trees with high plantation densities, the UAV method was\
    \ affected by the planting\ndensity, with less accuracy as the number of trees\
    \ increased, and the distance between trees\ndecreased. These results agree with\
    \ those obtained for other species, such as olive trees [8],\nwhere the vegetation’s\
    \ high density negatively affected the canopy volume estimation.\nVolume mapping\
    \ also creates the opportunity to design site-speciﬁc treatments adapted\nto the\
    \ needs of the trees according to their size; the application of these treatments\
    \ with\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 541\n14 of 16\nvariable-rate sprayers has allowed\
    \ a pesticide savings of up to 58% of the application\nvolume [45] in vineyards.\n\
    Photogrammetric reconstruction of crop canopies could be used to estimate the\
    \ canopy\ncharacteristics accurately. For example, DSMcanopy could represent the\
    \ base maps, where the\nevident heterogeneity in the canopy vigor was effectively\
    \ quantified with the proposed algorithm.\nNumerous studies, such as [46], have\
    \ highlighted the importance of monitoring crop\nvariability by applying precision\
    \ agriculture principles. However, if much progress has\nbeen made on crops such\
    \ as vines and olives, in terms of hazelnut cultivation, research\nmust still\
    \ investigate numerous aspects. This work, together with [6,31], could represent\
    \ a\nﬁrst step towards improved knowledge of hazelnut cultivation.\nIn this paper,\
    \ the determination of geometric characteristics was made in two types\nof planting\
    \ situations. To save on agricultural inputs, including water and fertilizers,\
    \ the\nchoice of intensive trees has found numerous applications in recent years.\
    \ Determining the\nrelationship between light, temperature, water, and vegetative\
    \ development is a challenge\nfor the future. Different planting densities can\
    \ affect the light, temperature, heat, and\nenzyme activity of assimilated metabolism\
    \ at different positions in the canopy [47,48]. In\naddition, dense trees seem\
    \ to increase the size of the trees. Studies on others crops (such\nas olives,\
    \ cotton, and maize) have also reported that higher planting densities can reduce\n\
    water evaporation and increase water consumption in the ﬁeld [48,49]. In addition,\
    \ a\nreasonably high planting density could affect the fruit quality [9]. Thus,\
    \ in the future, the\nirrigation rate could be investigated in relation to higher\
    \ planting density and the growth\nof the canopy.\n5. Conclusions\nThis study\
    \ revealed that the hazelnut canopy size and volume derived by the UAV\nmethod\
    \ were close to those obtained via manual delineation and ﬁeld measurement. The\n\
    UAV method could replace ﬁeld measurement to achieve signiﬁcant labour savings.\
    \ More-\nover, using the UAV method, a large amount of information can be extracted\
    \ (tree height;\nvolume, thickness, and width of the canopy), whereas traditional\
    \ on-ground observation of\nthe same ﬁeld would require much more time and effort.\n\
    In addition, this study showed high correlations between the measurements of the\
    \ main\nplant characteristics, such as canopy volume, between the UAV and manual\
    \ measurements.\nFinally, the present study has developed two methods for calculating\
    \ the volume\nof a hazelnut canopy. In one method, the canopy is assimilated into\
    \ a cylinder, and\nthe measurements are well correlated with the manual ones.\
    \ In the other, however, the\ncanopy is well deﬁned in its shape. It, therefore,\
    \ provides more precise information on the\nmanagement of the tree, e.g., the\
    \ intensity of annual pruning or vegetative growth.\nThe results presented here\
    \ could beneﬁt growers and the scientiﬁc community working\non management practices\
    \ in hazelnut orchards. For example, such methods can be crucial\nwhen deciding\
    \ on the variable rate of chemical or irrigation applications.\nSupplementary\

    **Abstract**


    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are rapidly becoming an essential part of our
    everyday lives. They are being used in a wide variety of applications, from industrial
    automation to environmental monitoring to healthcare. As the number of WSN applications
    grows, so too does the need for energy-efficient WSNs.


    The traditional approach to energy management in WSNs has been to use low-power
    hardware and software. However, these approaches are often not enough to meet
    the energy demands of modern WSN applications. As a result, there has been a growing
    interest in new energy management techniques for WSNs.


    In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art in energy management for WSNs. We
    discuss the different types of energy management techniques, their advantages
    and disadvantages, and their potential for future research.


    **Introduction**


    WSNs are composed of a large number of small, low-power devices that are deployed
    in a distributed fashion. These devices typically have limited energy resources,
    which means that energy management is a critical issue for WSNs.


    There are two main types of energy management techniques for WSNs: **reactive**
    and **proactive**. Reactive techniques respond to changes in the network''s energy
    level, while proactive techniques take steps to prevent the network from running
    out of energy.


    **Reactive Energy Management Techniques**


    Reactive energy management techniques typically involve turning off or reducing
    the power of devices when the network''s energy level is low. These techniques
    can be very effective in reducing energy consumption, but they can also lead to
    performance degradation.


    Some of the most common reactive energy management techniques include:


    * **Duty cycling:** This technique involves turning off devices for a period of
    time, and then turning them back on again. Duty cycling can be very effective
    in reducing energy consumption, but it can also lead to latency and jitter.

    * **Power scaling:** This technique involves reducing the power of devices when
    the network''s energy level is low. Power scaling can be very effective in reducing
    energy consumption, but it can also lead to performance degradation.

    * **Adaptive routing:** This technique involves choosing routes that minimize
    energy consumption. Adaptive routing can be very effective in reducing energy
    consumption, but it can also lead to increased latency.


    **Proactive Energy Management Techniques**


    Proactive energy management techniques take steps to prevent the network from
    running out of energy. These techniques typically involve storing energy in a
    battery or capacitor, and then using that energy to power the network when the
    network''s energy level is low.


    Some of the most common proactive energy management techniques include:


    * **Energy harvesting:** This technique involves converting energy from the environment
    into electrical energy. Energy harvesting can be very effective in providing a
    sustainable source of energy for WSNs, but it can also be expensive and inefficient.

    * **Battery storage:** This technique involves storing energy in a battery. Battery
    storage can be very effective in providing a reliable source of energy for WSNs,
    but it can also be heavy and expensive.

    * **Capacitor storage:** This technique involves storing energy in a capacitor.
    Capacitor storage can be very effective in providing a fast and reliable source
    of energy for WSNs, but it can also be large and expensive.


    **Conclusion**


    Energy management is a critical issue for WSNs. There are a wide variety of energy
    management techniques available, and the best technique for a particular application
    will depend on the specific requirements of that application.


    In this paper, we have surveyed the state-of-the-art in energy management for
    WSNs. We have discussed the different types of energy management techniques, their
    advantages and disadvantages, and their potential for future research.


    We believe that energy management will continue to be a critical issue for WSNs
    in the future. As the number of WSN applications grows, so too will the need for
    energy-efficient WSNs. We hope that this paper will help researchers and practitioners
    to develop new energy management techniques for WSNs that will enable these networks
    to meet the challenges of the future.'

    Get rights and content Abstract Internet-of-Things (IoT) refers to the massive
    network interconnection of objects often equipped with ubiquitous intelligence
    employed to provide smart services to end users. However, one of the substantial
    issues of IoT is the limited energy of IoT devices that are expected to run consistently
    for a long period of time without battery replacement. Moreover, in the wake of
    pervasive IoT, the number of IoT devices has exploded and lead to a tremendous
    rise in IoT networks carbon footprint. In this regard, Green-IoT and energy management
    of IoT emerged as challenging and attractive research topics for both academia
    and industry. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and an up-to-date survey
    on recent energy management techniques in IoT networks. We start by presenting
    the challenges of energy consumption in IoT networks. Then, we will present novel
    and well-known energy management approaches for IoT but focus on the most recent
    solutions proposed in each approach. Next, we will provide a comprehensive survey
    of the most recent energy management solutions for IoT ecosystem. We will also
    present recent trends and new research perspectives that can be exploited for
    energy conservation in IoT networks. Finally, we will give recommendations on
    how to exploit the techniques presented in our survey to achieve the IoT applications
    QoS requirements. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet-of-Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that envisions to connect everyday
    objects and integrate them to the internet using microcontrollers, transceivers,
    and protocol stacks. This paradigm attracts the attention of both academia and
    industries and aims at the digitization of a plethora of applications with high
    societal relevance. The IoT applications in our daily life activities are manifold,
    from smart transportation that offers ground breaking progress in the transportation
    and logistic industry to smart home that facilitates its in-habitants activities.
    IoT covers several fields such as smart traffic, healthcare, agriculture, industry
    4.0 and can even be found in our everyday objects such as pens, clothes, etc.
    As a result, the world has known an explosive growth in the number of these devices.
    According to IHS Markit, 125 billions of IoT devices are expected to be connected
    with each other by 2030 (Howell, 2017). This number is highly influenced by the
    emergence of 5G networks and the exploitation of new spectrum frequencies (Li
    et al., 2018). Moreover, IoT devices are usually small and battery limited and
    the exchange of massive information between these devices gives rise to enormous
    energy requirements. These requirements are often not supported by IoT devices
    and can quickly lead to battery depletion and the network’s death. So, how can
    we develop energy-efficient solutions that will not only reduce the energy consumption
    in IoT networks and their carbon footprints but also increase the networks lifetime?
    Accordingly, we witness the emergence of the Green Internet of Things which focuses
    on saving and managing energy in IoT networks in order to optimize and reduce
    the energy consumption and prolong the IoT networks lifetime. In the next few
    years, Green IoT will make significant changes in our daily life and will help
    realize the vision of “green ambient intelligence” (Al-Turjman et al., 2019).
    In this survey, we are going to present a wide range of energy harvesting and
    energy saving techniques and set out the recent research trends for Green IoT
    such as green 5G IoT, green social IoT, green networks softwarization, backscatter
    communications, etc. This paper is organized as follows : In Section 2, we present
    the background information on the energy management works presented in the literature.
    In Section 3, we describe the problem and challenges of energy consumption in
    IoT networks. In Section 4, we discuss and select some of the energy harvesting
    and energy saving techniques presented in the literature focusing on the most
    recent researches. In Section 5, we present the energy management technologies
    for IoT ecosystem. In Section 6, we discuss the recent trends and research perspectives
    that can be exploited in energy management for IoT. Finally, we shall conclude
    the paper by providing an insight into open research problems and the future of
    Green IoT. Table 1. The table shows a comparison of the main features of this

    The subject of energy management for IoT networks has been widely studied and
    various reviews and surveys were presented throughout the years. Researchers are
    interested in energy efficient WSNs since they are widely deployed and omnipresent
    in IoT. In Khan et al. (2015), the authors presented battery-driven energy conservation
    and energy harvesting schemes used to design algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs). The authors focused on reviewing the protocols used for the energy management
    of wireless sensor networks. Compared to this survey, our survey does not only
    focus on sensors but the different devices IoT networks can include. In Singh
    et al. (2020), the authors surveyed energy saving and energy management schemes
    and energy efficient protocols for WSNs focusing on transmission power management
    and miscellaneous techniques. Compared to our survey, this survey does not include
    the energy harvesting and wireless charging solutions of IoT networks. In Shaikh
    and Zeadally (2016), the authors surveyed the energy harvesting approaches used
    in WSNs which help to improve WSN lifetime. Compared to our survey, this survey
    focus only on energy harvesting of wireless sensor networks and not the different
    types of devices we can have in IoT networks. In our work, we present solutions
    not only energy saving and harvesting solutions for sensors but also rich resources
    devices. In the recent years, more and more authors started to use the Green IoT
    appellation. Green IoT refers to the energy efficient hardware or software procedures
    used to reduce the greenhouse effect of existing IoT applications and services
    as well as the impact of greenhouse effect of IoT itself (Shaikh et al., 2015).
    It represents all the enabling technologies for Green IoT such as Green RFIDs
    (radio frequency identification), Green Datacenters, Green Sensor Networks, Green
    Cloud Computing, Green Edge Computing and Green Communications. In Albreem et
    al. (2017), a Green IoT life cycle is presented which includes: green design,
    green production, green utilization, green recycling in addition to green IoT
    technologies such as green tags, green sensing networks and green Internet technologies.
    In Arshad et al. (2017), the authors discussed IoT techniques to achieve Green
    IoT and proposed a taxonomy of energy efficient based on the technologies used
    in IoT while in Tahiliani and Dizalwar (2018), the authors discussed energy efficiency
    techniques of different components and layers of IoT networks. Compared to our
    survey, the previous works do not include the energy harvesting techniques for
    IoT networks. In Table 1, we present a comparison between our survey and the other
    energy management and Green IoT surveys. It is clear through Table 1 that, in
    our survey, we chose to present novel schemes that were not discussed in the surveys
    presented previously. The main purpose of our paper is to provide an up-to-date
    state-of-art about energy management and Green IoT. Our comprehensive survey discusses
    the different and most recent techniques used in order to reduce energy consumption
    and increase the networks lifetime in IoT networks. Therefore, this article aims
    to serve as a guideline for researchers interested in the trends of energy management
    IoT networks. Download : Download high-res image (409KB) Download : Download full-size

    Since IoT applications and services are reaching almost every corner our life,
    the carbon footprint of these applications is increasing proportionately with
    the number of IoT devices. IoT networks are composed of devices that can be rich
    or limited in energy resources. The aim of Green IoT is to reduce the energy consumption
    of both types of devices while still being able to effectively perform their tasks
    and services. Key and widespread IoT technologies such as wireless sensor networks
    are composed of small and battery limited sensor devices that gather information
    and build efficient and reliable information and communication systems. However,
    these devices are typically used to perform monitoring and control tasks in IoT
    applications over long periods of time and without interruption. Sensors can also
    be placed in areas which are difficult to access (e.g. under water systems, military
    systems, unsafe environments, etc.) and can quickly run out of energy. Consequently,
    replacing their batteries frequently becomes an arduous and costly task. Energy
    storage and power management should also ensure the constant availability and
    operability of IoT devices given that, neither cable-power nor battery replacement
    are feasible options in harsh conditions. Many energy saving software and hardware
    solutions, which we will present in our survey, have been developed in order to
    reduce IoT networks energy consumption and maintenance cost. Currently, the world
    experiences a scarcity in energy sources in addition to the important emission
    of CO2 resulting of human activity. Greening information and communication technologies
    becomes an imperious need considering the damages caused on our environment. Consequently,
    energy harvesting solutions has been studied in order to power IoT devices with
    green and renewable energies such as solar energy, wind energy, mechanical energy,
    etc. Since Green IoT is a newly studied research field, one essential domain that
    is not widely discussed is energy measurement. In fact, with the battery limited
    nature of IoT devices and their high number and energy consumption, measuring
    and analyzing the energy consumption of IoT devices is key to achieve applications’
    QoS requirements. Due to the high cost and large size of the existing commercial
    energy measurement solutions, researchers proposed various alternatives. However,
    these alternatives are often limited with their complexity, measurement range
    and accuracy (Dezfouli et al., 2018). IoT energy measurement tools should also
    be standardized to be able to support all types of devices with their different
    complexities at a low cost. As we can see, although the revolution of IoT changing
    our lives has started, many challenges still need to be overcome in terms of energy
    consumption and environmental issues. Accordingly, numerous potential solutions
    in different disciplines are being explored to achieve this goal that requires
    a lot of efforts. Download : Download high-res image (348KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Backscatter communication paradigms. 4. Energy management
    techniques In order to tackle the energy issues in IoT networks, two approaches
    are usually employed: energy harvesting and energy saving. Energy harvesting can
    be described as the mechanisms employed to produce energy from a network ambient
    environment to provide an uninterrupted power supply for the network devices.
    On the other hand, energy saving schemes focus on developing algorithms, protocols
    and even hardware solutions to minimize the network energy consumption and maximize
    its lifetime. Based on these two categories, we propose a technique-based taxonomy
    (Fig. 1) which represents the recent energy management solutions studied in the
    literature in order to extend IoT networks lifetime and reduce the carbon footprint
    of those networks. Our taxonomy includes recent energy management techniques that
    can be found in the literature and not discussed in previous surveys. As shown
    in Fig. 1, we divide the energy harvesting category in the taxonomy depending
    on the energy sources into four sections: RF energy harvesting in which we include
    Backscatter Communications (BCC) (Hoang et al., 2020), a novel energy harvesting
    technology that have not been mentioned in previous energy management and Green
    IoT surveys, Mobile Energy Transfer (MET) and Simultaneous Wireless Information
    and Power Transfer (SWIPT) technology. We also discuss the most recent researches
    in energy harvesting techniques with green sources such as : solar, thermal and
    mechanical energy. We will present these techniques more deeply later in this
    section. The second category of energy management solutions we represent in the
    taxonomy includes energy saving solutions. As shown in Fig. 1, we classified energy
    saving solutions depending on the technology they employ. Unlike existing energy
    management surveys, in our survey, we introduce recent intelligent energy saving
    techniques that use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to reduce the
    energy consumption in IoT networks. We present energy efficient data collection
    techniques used in IoT networks as well as, sleep/wake-up schemes such as Duty
    Cycling and the recent low power Wake-Up Radio technology which have not been
    presented in the existing energy management and Green IoT surveys. In what follows,
    we will discuss the energy management techniques for IoT networks. First, we start
    by presenting the energy harvesting techniques followed by the energy saving techniques
    discussed in the literature. It is worth mentioning that we will present and focus
    more deeply on the emerging energy management techniques which have not been discussed
    in previous surveys. Table 3. The table shows the energy harvesting techniques
    and their challenges. Energy harvesting techniques Concept Challenges Backscatter

    it to the receiver -Short range -Efficient information coding -Security -High

    Energy harvesting techniques We will discuss the energy harvesting techniques
    existing in the literature. We focus our review on the recent solutions proposed
    for each one of these techniques. In Table 3, we present the concept and challenges
    of the energy harvesting techniques presented in our survey and Table 2 summarizes
    the energy harvesting works organized by the nature of the harvested energy: RF,
    solar, thermal and mechanical energy. 4.1.1. RF energy harvesting (wireless power
    transfer techniques) In what follows, we will present RF energy harvesting techniques
    focusing deeply on backscatter technology since it is an emerging technique in
    energy harvesting that has not been presented in previous surveys. 1. Backscatter
    Communications One of the major issues that IoT networks face is the limited network
    lifetime due to the battery dependency of IoT devices. Having these devices completing
    task over a long period of time could easily lead to battery depletion and induce
    a replacement cost. In some cases, sensors do not need to be kept active consistently
    and will wear out their batteries unnecessarily. Backscatter communications allows
    battery-less devices to transform wireless signals and use them as a source of
    power and a communication medium. Having battery-less devices is a major advantage
    of backscatter communications as it helps reducing energy consumption, removes
    the constraint of frequent battery replacement and averts from undesired performances
    due to energy shortage. According to Hoang et al. (2020), there are three different
    paradigms of Backscatter Communications (Fig. 2):Monostatic Backscatter Communication
    (MBC), Bistatic Backscatter Communication (BBC) and Ambient Backscatter Communication
    (ABC). • Monostatic Backscatter Communication: as shown in Fig. 2(a) MBC system
    is composed of two components: a reader and a backscatter transmitter (e.g. a
    RFID tag). The specificity of MBC is that the receiver and the RF source are located
    in the reader. The RF source sends a signal that activates the tag which modulates
    the signal and reflects it back to the backscatter receiver. Since the RF source
    and the receiver are located in the same device, the modulated signals may suffer
    from a round trip path loss which makes it more suited for short-range RFID application.
    • Bistatic Backscatter Communication: the main difference between BBC and MBC
    systems lies in the separation of the RF source (renamed the carrier emitter in
    BBC) and the backscatter receiver in different components which significantly
    reduce the round-trip path-loss problem (as represented in Fig. 2(b)). Moreover,
    by optimally placing carrier emitters, the overall communication range can be
    extended and the system performance is greatly improved. Although the deployment
    and maintenance of the carrier emitters in BBCs are costly, their design remains
    simple which makes their manufacturing cost lower than MBCs. • Ambient Backscatter
    Communication: in Ambient backscatter communication systems (Fig. 2(c)) and similarly
    to BBC systems, ABC systems carrier emitter is separated from the backscatter
    receiver. However, the carrier emitter, in this case, can be an already available
    ambient RF source in the environment such as a Wi-Fi access point or a cellular
    base station. In Zhang et al. (2019a), an ABS system is presented as a batteryless
    device (tag or sensor) which can harvest wireless energy from a RF source and
    then transmit “0” or “1” bit to a sink node through reflecting or non-reflecting
    states. In addition to having virtually no cost of deployment, the manufacturing
    costs and power consumption of ABCs can be reduced by the use of low-cost and
    low-power components. Various works studied the backscatter communications and
    its impact on the energy consumption of IoT networks and proposed solutions to
    further improve the energy efficiency of these systems. In Yang et al. (2018),
    the authors proposed a cooperative ambient backscatter communication system which
    allows a device to recover information from both the ambient backscatter devices
    and the RF source. The proposed solution enhances the maximum-likelihood detection
    performance if the backscatter device symbol period is longer than the RF source
    symbol period. This solution can be upgraded to be exploited in smart home and
    wearable applications. In order to further enhance the energy efficiency of backscatter
    communications, various works studied the optimization of the communication parameters.
    The authors in Ji et al. (2020) proposed a joint optimization based on the source
    antenna number and power splitting factor under the condition that the minimum
    energy required by the destination node is met while in Timoudas et al. (2020),
    the authors proposed a solution to optimize the needed power to transmit for a
    base station and the radio of backscattered signal of the IoT devices in the context
    of massive IoT. For complex IoT systems, other parameters (such as the number
    of base stations, the number of backscatter devices and their positions) need
    to be optimized in order to be energy efficient and to adapt to the IoT application
    needs. The authors in Feng et al. (2018), focused on the link layer of backscatter
    communication systems using centralized MAC protocols, while other solutions used
    distributed MAC protocol (Ma et al., 2018, Cao et al., 2019). Distributed MAC
    protocols are more suitable than the centralized protocols for large-scale IoT
    networks with unstable network topologies and high topology maintenance cost.
    Although backscatter communications seem ideal to achieve green IoT, it still
    has to overcome some challenges such as the risk of interference when there is
    a high number of nodes as well as, the bit rate limitations as it is not simple
    to implement very complex modulations on a backscatter tag due to its limited
    capability in manipulating the RF signal and performing baseband processing. In
    addition to that, backscatter communications networks need to overcome the short
    range limitation and the high deployment cost they may generate. 2. Simultaneous
    Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) SWIPT is one of the most attractive
    and challenging technologies in energy management. It is a technique that enables
    the simultaneous transfer of information and power wirelessly (Perera et al.,
    2017b). Theoretically, SWIPT allows an IoT device to harvest energy and receive
    RF information from the same RF signal that carries both energy and information.
    Therefore, an IoT device can be self-powered by receiving data. However, in most
    of the cases, it is not possible to perform energy harvesting and information
    decoding simultaneously from the same signal. The information could be altered
    or lost by the energy harvesting operation. Thus, different receiver architectures
    were designed to achieve SWIPT: Separate Receiver, Time Switching (TS), Power
    Splitting(PS) and Antenna Switching (Perera et al., 2017b). In SWIPT, the power
    and information needed for an IoT node are sent at the same time which keeps the
    node alive and extend the lifetime of IoT networks. Various solutions have been
    proposed to adapt and achieve SWIPT. For example, in Perera et al. (2017a), the
    authors provide a comprehensive study related to SWIPT in different types of wireless
    communication setups. In Liu and Ansari (2019), the authors proposed a dual-battery
    green energy harvesting architecture that achieves SWIPT. It consists in using
    one battery to power the device while the other one is harvesting energy in order
    to reduce energy shortage probability. However, this solution is limited to small
    IoT networks with devices that can support a dual battery. The proposed solution
    also adds complexity to sensor devices and is expensive for massive IoT networks
    with a high number of devices. In Lu et al. (2017), the authors proposed a collaborative
    energy and information transfer protocol for WSN that does not require the power
    and information splitter component which is convenient for IoT networks and reduces
    the sensors complexity and cost. In Huang et al. (2018), the authors studied the
    optimization of the energy efficiency in a SWIPT-based distributed antenna system
    by coordinating the energy harvesting and information decoding for IoT devices.
    The proposed solutions take into consideration the number of IoT devices in the
    network. SWIPT was also associated with deep learning to further enhance the energy
    saving potential of this technology. In Luo et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    a solution based on deep learning to minimize the total transmit power of a multi-carrier
    NOMA SWIPT system while satisfying the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of
    each user. Deep learning was also used with SWIPT in Park et al. (2020b). The
    authors proposed a dual mode SWIPT system that uses an adaptive mode switching
    based on deep learning to exploit both single tone and multi-tone SWIPT. Although
    deep learning proves to be efficient for SWIPT-based system, it also requires
    an important amount of resources that should be considered to build green and
    sustainable IoT networks. In Lee and Lee (2018), the authors proposed a hybrid
    resource and task algorithm in a SWIPT system that enables the devices to do their
    requirement tasks in a distributed manner. However, this solution should be improved
    to take into consideration delay-sensitive tasks for it to satisfy the real-time
    requirement of IoT applications. Finally in Liu et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    a cooperative SWIPT scheme that consists of a conflict-free schedule initialization
    algorithm, a cooperative resource allocation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm
    to obtain a maximum energy efficiency in the transmission schedule with the appropriate
    resource allocation policy. SWIPT is theoretically a very efficient energy harvesting
    technique. However, this technique offers several challenges. In SWIPT, the information
    and energy are sent through the same signal. This signal needs to be efficiently
    decoded in order to recover the correct information. The signal can also be altered
    by the energy harvesting mechanisms or by interference. SWIPT is limited in range
    since the signals can weaken when crossing long distances. Finally, signals that
    are sent to the devices can be hijacked by hackers. Therefore, a level of security
    should be added in order to protect potential private and personal data. 3. Mobile
    Energy Transfer Mobile energy transfer is an ambitious energy efficient technique
    for IoT networks. It extends wireless power transfer technologies since the use
    of classical wireless power transfer technologies is not suitable if the node
    is isolated, placed in areas which are difficult to access and does not support
    free charging. Mobile energy transfer consists in giving to a mobile node (such
    as a car, a bus, etc.), the ability to transfer energy to the devices within its
    transmission range. Various works have studied the use of mobile energy transfer
    technology for IoT networks energy management. The energy consumption of the mobile
    node is a key challenge of mobile energy transfer enabled IoT networks. In Almasoud
    and Kamal (2017), the authors proposed a solution to minimize the total energy
    consumption of a mobile base station while supporting the data and energy demands
    of IoT devices to guarantee the QoS. This study shows that various parameters
    can impact the energy consumption of MET based IoT networks such as the mobile
    base station locations and its movement speed, the number of devices and their
    tolerable time for delivering data and energy as well as the transmission powers
    (the power needed for energy and data transmission). In Madhja et al. (2016),
    the authors proposed a hierarchical and wireless energy transfer using mobile
    chargers in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks while in Zhang et al. (2019b),
    the authors presented one of the mobile energy transfer technologies called Adaptive
    Resonant Beam Charging (ARBC). As shown in Fig. 3, it consists of two specially
    separated components: a transmitter and a receiver (car, TV, etc.) and in some
    cases, a relay (UAV in Fig. 3) which is used to relay the energy between the transmitter
    and the receiver. In Liu et al. (2018), the authors proposed a mobile power network
    based on long range and short range wireless power transfer technologies and discussed
    the challenges of MET such as interference, efficiency, range and topology. Download

    Mobile energy transfer RBC scenario. 4.1.2. Solar energy harvesting Given its
    abundance in the environment, solar energy is considered as an affordable and
    clean energy source that could eliminate the energy shortage problem in IoT networks.
    This technique directly converts sunlight into usable electricity which is convenient
    for location with high light availability. However, the solar energy harvesting
    technique flaws arise in locations where light availability cannot always be guaranteed.
    Additionally, transporting solar energy from a location to another when needed
    may cause considerable energy waste which shows that there is still room for research
    and improvement in this area. In the literature, various authors studied solar
    energy harvesting for IoT networks. In Luo et al. (2018), the authors presented
    a review on solar energy harvesting for IoT applications and discussed the use
    of artificial intelligence and more specifically artificial neural networks to
    enhance and rapidly design energy harvesting systems for IoT applications. Numerous
    authors proposed solutions on solar energy harvesting for WSNs in Li and Shi,
    2015, Shin and Joe, 2016, Nguyen et al., 2017. In Li and Shi (2015), the authors
    proposed an intelligent solar energy harvesting system based on maximum power
    point tracking for wireless sensor nodes used in IoT, which prefers to use the
    solar power and takes the lithium battery as a supplementary under the condition
    of inadequate illumination. This solution offers IoT systems more reliability
    in case of scarcity in solar energy in the area. In Shin and Joe (2016), the authors
    proposed an energy prediction algorithm that uses the light intensity of fluorescent
    lamps in an indoor environment for wireless sensor nodes for IoT. This solution
    can be particularly helpful to achieve green and sustainable smart home since
    lamps can be used to power the sensors used in the smart home. In Nguyen et al.
    (2017), the authors proposed a new routing algorithm that aims to improve the
    lifetime of sensor nodes as well as the QoS under variable traffic load and solar
    and RF energy availability. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the
    energy efficiency of the IoT network even if the number of nodes increases drastically
    which constitutes a suitable solution for massive, complex and scalable IoT networks.
    In Wu et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2018b, the authors proposed a solution to improve
    solar energy harvesting in wearable IoT applications. In Wu et al. (2016), the
    authors proposed an MPPT algorithm based on the output current to extract the
    maximum power from a flexible solar panel to power wearable pulse sensors. Finally,
    in Wu et al. (2018b), the authors presented a self-powered wearable IoT sensor
    network that uses solar energy and is designed for safety environmental monitoring.

    Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat and variation in temperature.
    The human body and the environment can be a source of thermal energy. For example,
    a difference in temperature can be created by the human body and the environment
    depending on the health condition, the location of a person, or body motion. There
    are two techniques that are used in thermal energy harvesting: thermometric, a
    technique that directly converts temperature difference into usable energy and
    pyroelectric, a technique that generates electrical energy when there is a change
    in temperature. It is important to efficiently generate electric energy from thermal
    generator in order to extract maximum electric energy to power devices and exploit
    the maximum potential of this approach. In the literature, various authors tackled
    the subject of thermal energy harvesting for IoT. In Abdal-Kadhim and Leong (2018),
    the authors discussed the use of thermal energy harvesting approach to power up
    a wireless sensor node for IoT applications. This study shows the efficiency of
    using thermal energy to power IoT nodes and the importance of using thermal energy
    harvesting in long-term IoT applications. Thermal energy harvesting proves to
    be efficient for various IoT applications. For example, in Yun et al. (2016),
    the authors studied the use of energy thermal harvesting for self-powered smart
    home sensors. For healthcare, in Priya et al. (2018), the authors studied a human
    body heat-based solution for wearable biomedical IoT nodes. Finally, in Teplỳ
    et al. (2019), the authors proposed a solution to optimize the energy consumption
    of thermal energy in IoT nodes by proposing an intelligent control of the individual
    parts of an IoT node. Unlike in Abdal-Kadhim and Leong (2018), This solution uses
    a battery to store the harvested energy and then uses the nodes’ battery to power
    the application. 4.1.4. Mechanical energy harvesting Mechanical energy harvesting
    consists in harvesting the energy that results from movement, pressure, human
    activity or any type of motion from an object. It is considered as a very efficient
    energy harvesting solution since the more and faster the object moves the more
    energy is produced to do more tasks. Mechanical energy comes from various sources
    such as wind and water flow or human motion and can be converted into electrical
    energy and exploited to supply IoT devices. For example, it can be interesting
    to use the energy produced from human motion to power a human temperature monitoring
    device that the user wears or powering neighboring houses using energy produced
    by wind and water flow. Mechanical energy harvesting offers a wide range of possibilities
    which makes it an ideal solution for creating green and sustainable applications.
    In the literature, mechanical energy harvesting have been thoroughly discussed.
    Several authors focused on wind flow and hydro in Jushi et al., 2016, Kamenar
    et al., 2016 respectively. In Jushi et al. (2016), the authors discussed the use
    of wind energy in autonomous WSNs and weather forecast to improve the prediction
    of wind condition in the near future. In this solution, the authors used a one
    and two hours weather forecast window in case of zero wind energy which shows
    that the unpredictable nature of wind energy makes it unsuitable for IoT applications
    that require constant availability and real-time performances. In Magno et al.
    (2016), the authors studied kinetic energy harvesting for wearables resulting
    from human motion. This study shows that human motion can produce an impressive
    amount of energy per day however, since the energy produced can vary from one
    person to another it can be difficult to develop a solution that is destined to
    a large population. In Kamenar et al. (2016), the authors described the conception,
    modeling, calculation, design, manufacturing and validation of the performances
    of energy harvesting devices deployed in river streams to be employed as a power
    source for pollution monitoring wireless sensor clusters. Table 5. The table shows

    The energy harvesting techniques presented in the previous sections are employed
    to produce energy from their surrounding environment and to power IoT networks.
    In Table 4, we summarize the energy harvesting techniques presented previously
    and the ability to use them in, what we consider, the major IoT applications (smart
    home, healthcare, agriculture and industrial IoT). For RF source harvested energy,
    SWIPT and MET can be applied to the use cases listed previously. In case of backscatter
    communications, the technology is suitable for smart homes, agriculture applications
    and indoor medical applications. Backscatter communications is still at a development
    stage, therefore, it faces limited-range, security and interference problems which
    makes it not suitable for applications that handle critical data and require a
    high level of reliability such as industrial and outdoor medical applications.
    Solar energy harvesting is largely used in smart homes and buildings, healthcare
    and agriculture. However, while solar energy can be used in industrial IoT, the
    network designers should take into consideration the uncontrollable nature of
    solar energy and how it can affect the performance of the high reliability requirements
    of industrial IoT applications. As shown in Table 4, thermal energy can be employed
    in different IoT applications as it can be frequently produced and stored to supply
    IoT devices. In case of mechanic energy harvesting, human motion is considered
    suitable for healthcare application. However, it does not produce enough energy
    to be helpful in the other applications. Wind and water flow can produce enough
    energy for various application, however, the uncontrollable nature of those energies
    is unsuitable for industrial IoT applications which require high availability
    and no energy shortage. 4.2. Energy saving techniques In this section, we discuss
    the existing energy saving techniques in the literature by presenting and focusing
    on the most recent solutions proposed in each one of these techniques. In Table
    5, we summarize the energy saving works studied in our survey. 4.2.1. Sleep/wake-up
    techniques 1. Wake-Up Radios: Wake-Up Radio is a novel hardware solution that
    has been developed to reduce the energy consumption of devices and extend the
    network lifetime. It consists in having a low power radio attached to the device
    main radio in charge of waking it up when an incoming signal is sensed. In IoT
    systems, a Wake-up Radio enabled IoT device has been defined in Froytlog et al.
    (2019). It is a microcontroller unit associated with a main radio and a wake-up
    receiver. The microcontroller and the main radio are in deep sleep most of the
    time. As shown in Fig. 4, when the receiver receives a request by means of a wake-up
    signal transmitted by an external node, it generates an interrupt signal to wake
    up the microcontroller to perform certain tasks and transmit data back via its
    main radio. Based on power usage, three types of wake-up radios have been identified
    (Piyare et al., 2017): active, passive and semi-active wake-up radios. Active
    wake-up radios require continuous external power supply such as batteries. Passive
    wake-up radios do not need energy from power supplies. They harvest energy from
    the transmitted signal instead. In semi-active wake-up radios, some components
    of the receiver require continuous power from an external source while the RF
    front-end remains passive. Wake-up radios can be particularly useful in a smart
    home/office scenario, or in an industrial context like warehouses and can be enhanced
    further to be used in smart cities (Deng et al., 2019). However, due to the sleep
    and wake-up nature of wake-up radio, we can expect an increase in data reception
    latency. According to Piyare et al. (2017), designing wake-up radio in a larger
    environment requires considering different design aspects such as: • Power consumption:
    the node’s power consumption should not exceed the main radio’s sleep power to
    keep the balance between the energy saved and used by the device. • Time to wake-up:
    the time needed to wake-up the device radio should be minimum in order to reduce
    the latency and thus enlarge the spectrum of applications Wake-up Radios can be
    used for. • False wake-ups and interference: due to interference and wrongly receiving
    signals intended to other devices, a node or several nodes could be unnecessarily
    activated causing huge energy waste. Thus, designers should find the right compromise
    and find solutions to those challenges without increasing the energy consumption.
    • Sensitivity: in Wake-up Radio environment, the sensitivity of the receiving
    node has a considerable impact on the power demand as having high sensitivity
    requires high power demand at the receiving side and having low sensitivity means
    needing high radiated power at the transmitter side. • Communication range: the
    range of a Wake-up Radio has an impact on the type of application it is used in,
    as well as on the system’s power consumption. For example, having short range
    communication would require a multi-hop communication which will increase the
    nodes density and the power consumption. • Data rate: having a higher data rate
    in a Wake-up Radio context is a way to improve energy efficiency and wake-up latency.
    Similarly, having a longer bit duration also increases the communication range
    and the reliability of the wake-up signal. • Cost and size: the Wake-up Radio
    should be cost effective in order to be integrated into the IoT context and existing
    sensor nodes. The cost should not exceed 5–10 per cent of the complete sensor
    node cost. • Frequency regulation: the design of Wake-up Radios should adhere
    to frequency regulations in industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands. It
    should also be adapted to communication standards such as the maximum allowed
    effective radiated power (ERP) used to transmit the Wake-up signal (WuS). In the
    literature, various studies proved the efficiency of low power wake-up radios
    energy saving. In Bello et al. (2019), the authors studied the design (from physical
    to media access control) and utilization of passive wake-up radios in IoT applications.
    This review also discusses the limitation of wake-up radios such as the short
    communication range, the high latency, lack of standardization, mobility as well
    as contention and channel access. In Basagni et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    GREENROUTES, an energy-aware cross-layer routing protocol for wake-up radio-based
    green networks. This protocol selects the relay nodes based on their distance
    in hops from the sink ans uses semantic addressing to enhance capabilities. Since
    wake-up radios are sensible to the distance between nodes, it would be interesting
    to see if this protocol is efficient in case the nodes are distantly distributed.
    The authors in Giovanelli et al. (2017) analyzed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons
    scenarios in IoT applications and discussed the benefits of integrating wake-up
    radios in the BLE protocol stack which can help both reduce the time to contact
    all the beacons and also reduce the current consumption. Low power wake-up radios
    networks still suffer from the limited range of their components. This is why,
    in Frøytlog et al. (2019), the authors tackled the wake-up radios limited range
    issue and proposed a design and implementation of long range low-power wake-up
    radio for IoT devices that increases the lifetime of the devices and reduces the
    power consumption and overall cost in a large scale deployment. Another approach
    was proposed in Rakovic et al. (2020) to improve the energy efficiency and communication
    range of wake-up radios in IoT systems. The proposed approach consists in applying
    error correction codes on wake-up signals. Since wake-up radio suffer from short
    range capability and low signal sensibility, wake-up radio commonly misinterpret
    the wake-up signal which leads to performance degradation of the system. Code
    correction on wake-up signals constitutes an efficient solution to improve the
    robustness and sensitivity of wake-up devices. 2. Duty-cycling: Duty-cycling,
    also known as ’sleep schedule’, is considered one of the most effective ways of
    saving energy and extending networks lifetime. Duty-cycling algorithms are used
    to reduce the node’s battery consumption by alternating between sleep and wake-up
    modes. The node is usually set in a low power mode and only wakes up when needed
    (e.g. data reception, radio transmission). Those algorithms usually fall under
    3 categories: topology control protocols, sleep/wake-up protocols and MAC protocols
    with low duty-cycles. Duty-cycling have been studied broadly and due to its constant
    relevance, several recent works on duty cycling and its impact on the energy consumption
    of IoT networks have been proposed. In Passos et al. (2019), the authors provided
    a qualitative and quantitative comparison between the families of asynchronous
    duty-cycling methods, their characteristics and the most suited Green IoT applications
    for each of them. Asynchronous duty-cycling methods undergo an excessive transmission
    energy consumption while waiting for the receiver wakes up in addition to the
    multiple unicast transmissions that not only consume energy but can also lead
    to a network congestion. In Munir et al. (2018), the authors proposed an algorithm
    to optimize the duty-cycle duration of low-power IoT devices equipped with energy
    harvesting circuits in Wi-Fi based IoT networks. This solution use an optimal
    weighting moving-average filter to predict the harvested energy and find the optimal
    weighting factor to estimate the duration of the off period for IoT devices. The
    devices will exploit the off periods to harvest enough energy for the data acquisition.
    Finally, in Dhall and Agrawal (2018), the authors proposed a modified duty cycling
    efficient path planning algorithm for an IoT-based precision agriculture system.
    The proposed duty-cycling algorithm is performed on the data transmission phase
    and the path planning algorithm studies all the path and chose the short path.
    This solution proves to be effective even with a high number of devices. However,
    since the solution’s performance depends on the clusters, it would be interesting
    to optimize the cluster organization in order to reduce the overall energy consumption.

    Fig. 4. Concept of wake-up radio. 4.2.2. Energy efficient data collection Millions
    of IoT devices are deployed in intelligent applications like smart homes, smart
    transportation, and so forth. These devices generate huge amounts of data. In
    order to communicate its data to the base station or to his neighbors, an IoT
    device will consume large amounts of energy. Moreover, IoT networks are usually
    constituted of a large number of devices that have limited batteries. Once emptied
    or depleted, those batteries are often difficult to replace especially if the
    devices are placed in an isolated or a difficult to access position. One promising
    solution is to collect the generated data and communicate it in an efficient way
    to reduce the transmission energy cost. Several data collection approaches have
    emerged in order to reduce the energy consumption, delay and maximize the network
    lifetime (Chandnani and Khairnar, 2020). 1. Data Aggregation approach: This approach
    consists in reducing the number of transmission in a network and remove redundant
    and duplicated transmission of data. Data aggregation is the procedure of one
    or a number of nodes that gather data from other nodes for a period of time, aggregate
    them and transmit the aggregated result. In Chandnani and Khairnar (2020), the
    authors divided the data aggregation techniques into three classes : tree based,
    cluster based and centralized based. In Pourghebleh and Navimipour (2017), the
    authors presented a systematic review on the data aggregation mechanisms for IoT
    and presented a detailed comparison of the techniques used in each class. The
    authors found out that tree-based techniques offer low energy consumption, high
    network lifetime and great scalability compared to the other techniques while
    cluster-based techniques offer low traffic and high fault tolerance. On the other
    hand, centralized techniques focus mainly on security aspects. The latency, network
    lifetime as well as device heterogeneity should also be considered in data aggregation
    techniques. In John and Jyotsna (2018), the authors did a review on tree-based
    data aggregation techniques. The tree architecture is composed of nodes structured
    in the form of a tree. A tree contains leaf nodes and forwarding nodes. The authors
    found out that tree-based aggregation consumes less energy than clustering and
    grid-based aggregation. However, in a tree-based approach, the failure of a intermediate
    node affects the whole topology and disturbs the network activity. In Song et
    al. (2017), the authors proposed a cluster-based data collection technique that
    uses a sensor based cluster formation algorithm to elect the controllers and handle
    the different types of sensors. This algorithm is used alongside a multi-tier
    aggregation function. This solution allows us to extend the network lifetime,
    maximize the coverage and eliminate redundant data at the controller. However,
    using these structures can have major drawbacks. For example, tree and cluster
    structures increase the vulnerability of the network and make it less secure.
    They also do not take into consideration sleep and transmission latency. In Ko
    et al. (2019), the authors proposed a centralized-based data aggregation for IoT
    which gathers data and sends it to a centralized IoT gateway. This method also
    proposes an efficient sleep scheduling method along with data aggregation in order
    to ensure data consistency in the network. Compared to the tree and cluster structures,
    the centralized structure is more secure. However, it has low fault tolerance.
    2. Probability based approach: The probability based approach allows us to save
    energy by using approximation models to find correlation between data. The goal
    of probability based solutions is to predict the value of the sensed data. In
    Razafimandimby et al. (2018), the authors proposed a Bayesian inference approach
    that allows us to avoid the transmission of highly correlated sensor data and
    reduce IoT networks energy consumption. This approach was applied to a hierarchical
    architecture with smart devices and data centers and proved to reduce the number
    of transmitted data with good information accuracy in three different scenarios.
    In general, it is difficult to implement since the devices that help achieve the
    probability based approach can be increasingly complex and the models are not
    optimal considering the high correlation between the devices data. 3. Compressive
    sensing based approach: Compressive sensing consists in compressing the collected
    data and reduce the quantity of data sent throughout the network. Compressive
    sensing help reduce the size of the sensory information matrix as possible to
    reduce information and communication redundancy. According to Chandnani and Khairnar
    (2020), compressive sensing approaches can be divided into three categories :
    Conventional compression, Distributed source coding and Distributed compressive
    sensing. In Uthayakumar et al. (2018), the authors presented a review on data
    compression techniques from different perspectives such as data quality, coding
    schemes, data type and applications. Data compressing techniques are described
    by their compatibility, representation efficiency, computational complexity and
    memory management. Data compressing solutions should optimize these characteristics
    in order to enhance the efficiency of IoT networks and reduce the devices complexity.
    In Wang et al. (2019a), the authors proposed a clustering routing protocol based
    on energy efficient compressive sensing that finds the optimal size of a cluster,
    the optimal distribution of cluster heads and also alleviate the ”hot spot problem”.
    This solution reduces efficiently the overall energy consumption of the network
    and extend its lifetime. In this case, there is a temporal correlation between
    data which means it would be interesting to use a predictive approach in order
    to reduce the energy consumption resulting from the spatial–temporal correlation.
    In Hsieh et al. (2020), the authors employed distributed source coding between
    two node in a NOMA pair to optimize the performance and minimize the energy consumption
    in resource-constrained cellular IoT networks. This solution focuses only on mobile
    broadband applications, where transmissions typically occur in the downlink with
    full-buffered traffic. 4. Mobility based Data Collection: Recently, mobile data
    collection approaches have been widely used as a mean to develop energy efficient
    IoT networks and extend their lifetime. Mobile data collection allows battery-limited
    devices to save their transmission energy and thus extend their lifetime. Mobile
    data collection can be achieved by three methods. The first method consists in
    using static sensor nodes and a mobile sink that will collect data from these
    nodes when they are sufficiently close to it. The second method consists in having
    a static sink and mobile nodes. Since the nodes can move, they improve the network
    coverage and decrease the number of nodes needed (e.g. we can have less sensors
    in the network since one sensor can move and cover other areas of the network).
    This strategy has been studied widely in the recent years the number of mobile
    is increasing. The third method consists in having mobile sensor nodes and a mobile
    sink. There have been various studies that focused on energy efficient mobility-based
    data collection in the literature. In Wang et al., 2019b, Zhan et al., 2017, Chen
    et al., 2019, the authors studied the use a mobile sink (UAV) with fixed nodes
    and proposed a solution that optimizes the UAV trajectory in order to ensure an
    energy efficient data collection. In Chang et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    an algorithm for a distributed bus-based data collection to maximize the lifetime
    and throughput of WSNs. On the other hand. Researchers also studied the use of
    a mobile nodes with a static sink. In Wang et al. (2018), the authors proposed
    a solution based on the Internet of Vehicles that allows traffic data gathering
    architecture with an efficient sink node selection. This solution shows only certain
    vehicles and paths should be selected to reduce the network energy consumption.
    As shown in the latter works, mobility-based data collection is a very promising
    energy saving technology if the mobile sink has a low carbon footprint and is
    provided with an optimized trajectory which constitutes a challenging research

    presented in the previous section are used to reduce the energy consumption of
    IoT devices as much as possible. In Table 6, we summarize the energy saving techniques
    presented previously and highlight the pros and cons of using these techniques
    in IoT networks. In case of sleep/wake-up schemes, both duty-cycling and wake-up
    radios considerably reduce the nodes energy consumption. While wake-up radios
    is an on-demand sleep and wake-up scheme, duty cycling schemes can be divided
    into three categories: on demand, asynchronous and schedule rendez-vous. Accordingly,
    wake-up radio schemes are able to reduce the idle listening and overhearing that
    duty-cycling may suffer from. However, it has a limited communication range, a
    high deployment cost and can suffer from high interference. Duty-cycling, on the
    other hand, in addition to idle listening, overhearing and over-emitting can also
    struggle with high sleep latency (e.g. sending data to a node who is not ready
    to receive data) and data transmission latency (e.g. waiting for the next wake-up
    phase to send data). Choosing either wake-up radios or duty-cycling depends essentially
    on the network needs and requirements. Energy efficient data collection approaches
    are efficient schemes to reduce the energy consumption of IoT. However, they still
    have challenges and issues to overcome such as security and latency issues for
    cluster-based and tree-based data aggregation or the hardly achievable sensory
    data sparsity in data compression. Mobility based approaches can also be subject
    to data loss and energy starvation if the system policy used is not well defined.
    5. Recent advances in IoT ecosystem energy management In order to achieve Green-IoT,
    several new approaches for energy management have been explored by the researchers
    to reduce the energy consumption of the different components of the IoT infrastructures
    from data centers to the IoT nodes. These developments emerged with the exploitation
    of new communication paradigms like 5G and the rapid growth of technologies such
    as artificial intelligence, cloud, etc. In this section, we will present the recent
    advances in energy management for IoT networks ecosystem. In Table 7, we summarize
    the energy management solutions studied for cloud, fog and edge enabled IoT networks.
    5.1. Energy management in IoT-cloud computing With the start of the IoT revolution,
    the number of IoT devices has exploded and with it, the amount of data collected
    by those devices. However, since IoT devices do not possess the computational
    power to process all of the collected data, cloud computing is considered as a
    very promising paradigm that provides high-performance computing capability and
    high-capacity storage to support the ubiquitous need for data collection and processing
    in IoT networks. Cloud computing allows the battery-dependent IoT devices to offload
    various tasks to the cloud (e.g. data cleaning) and conserve their energy. Although
    it can be convenient to use this technology, it is well-known that the cloud servers
    that host cloud applications are highly energy consuming. Therefore, it is also
    necessary to reduce the cloud energy consumption by using its resources efficiently.
    Reducing energy consumption in Cloud computing can also be achieved by the use
    of low-power devices and the virtualization of services. In the literature, a
    large scope of energy saving solutions in cloud computing enabled IoT networks
    have been studied. In Kaur and Sood (2015), the authors proposed an energy-efficient
    architecture for IoT that allows the system to predict the sleep interval of sensors-based
    IoT networks upon their remaining battery level and reduce the energy consumption
    of sensor nodes and cloud resources. However, this solution is not recommended
    for application with strict real-time requirements since it is specific to systems
    with a sleep/wake-up strategy. Various solutions proposed energy saving in cloud
    computing by using service composition optimization. In Baker et al. (2017), the
    authors proposed a multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm (E2C2). The composition
    of services is energy-aware and integrates the minimum number of IoT services
    to meet a user’s requirements. This solution outperforms similar algorithms have
    been previously proposed: All Cloud, Base Cloud, Smart Cloud (Zou et al., 2010)
    and COM2 (Kurdi et al., 2015). To further improve service composition solutions,
    we should take into account not only the cloud providers aggregate energy, but
    also the energy needed for the service execution. In Kumari and Kaushal (2017),
    the authors presented a partitioning method of an application into offloadable
    and non-offloadable components to reduce the energy consumption and the execution
    time. This solution offloads components to the cloud however, it requires high
    network reliability in order to ensure the application well functioning and availability.
    Other solutions focused on energy saving using power-aware virtual machine placement
    in cloud providers. In Gharehpasha et al. (2020), the authors also proposed a
    virtual machine placement algorithm in order to reduce the number of active physical
    machines and reduce their energy consumption while also load balancing between
    the active physical machines. However, in this solution a static virtual machine
    placement is done which means once a virtual machine is placement it cannot be
    migrated to another physical machine. In Alharbi et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    an ant system for dynamic virtual machine placement that reduces the number of
    active physical machines and reduces the overall energy consumption of the data
    center. In dynamic virtual machine placement, virtual machines can be migrated
    from one physical machine to another. Therefore, security strategies should be
    applied during migration in order to protect private data from hackers’ attacks.

    in fog computing Cloud computing offers a platform and frees businesses and end
    users from the burden of many specification details. However, it does not constitute
    an effective solution for latency sensitive applications and often fails to meet
    their delay requirements. Consequently, Fog computing emerged as a new paradigm
    that constitutes an extension of cloud computing at the edge of the network rather
    than a replacement to it. Fog Computing is a highly virtualized platform that
    provides computing, storage, and networking services between end devices and traditional
    Cloud Computing Data Centers (Bonomi et al., 2012). Fog Computing platforms are
    designed to support the mobility, geo-distribution in addition to low latency
    required in various IoT application (e.g. industrial-IoT). These characteristics
    make the Fog platforms suitable to support the energy constraints of Green-IoT
    applications. Various Fog computing solutions have been proposed in the literature
    to reduce the energy consumption in IoT systems. In Sarkar et al. (2015), the
    authors studied the sustainability of Fog Computing and its performances compared
    to traditional Cloud in terms of power consumption, emissions and cost in IoT
    networks. Fog computing enhances the performance of latency sensitive applications
    in terms of QoS and eco-friendliness. In Perera et al. (2017c), the authors identified
    major features (such as dynamic discovery, configuration, management of devices,
    multi-protocol support at different layers of the network architecture, mobility
    etc.) that fog computing platforms need to support toward building sustainable
    sensing infrastructure for smart city. Fog computing platforms should built in
    a manner that different applications can use. Such platforms should also offer
    build-in support for different types of communication and data analytics frameworks
    in order to implement the different features of fog-IoT platforms. In Mebrek et
    al. (2017), the authors proposed a solution that allows a number of IoT devices
    to select a fog instance that will receive their data considering the energy consumption
    (e.g energy consumed by the transport network, energy to process and store the
    data, energy to forward the data to the cloud if needed) and the latency (transmission
    latency, processing latency, forwarding to cloud latency). In Nayeri et al. (2021),
    the authors reviewed the AI based application placement solutions that address
    latency, resource utilization and energy consumption issues in fog enabled IoT
    networks. Fog application placement solution focus mostly on achieving efficient
    load balancing methods. Machine learning and more specifically, reinforcement
    learning algorithms, are widely used and combined with evolutionary algorithms
    in order to solve the fog application placement problem. Algorithms can be combined
    to cover each others’ weaknesses and achieve challenges such as security, privacy,
    availability, etc. In Peralta et al. (2017), the authors proposed an energy efficient
    fog-based IoT scheme that reduces end-devices energy consumption for industrial
    IoT by reducing their transmission. This scheme uses an MQ Telemetry Transport
    broker to predict future data measurements through prediction techniques, operate
    as gateway and offload expensive data processing from the Cloud to the Fog. In
    order to reduce the energy consumption in fog-based IoT networks, various fog
    computing models were proposed. In Oma et al. (2018a), the authors proposed a
    linear fog computing model to reduce the total energy consumption. Although linear
    models are simple and useful they are only suitable for IoT networks with few
    number of sensor nodes. Consequently, in Oma et al. (2018b), the authors proposed
    a tree-based fog computing model that supports a large number of IoT devices and
    reduces the total electric consumption compared to the Cloud Computing model.
    Finally in Lavassani et al. (2018), the authors proposed a distributed (online)
    learning model on the sensor device. The model is created by mining the collected
    data that approximate the data stream behavior and then transmitting only the
    updated model parameters to a fog computing system. This solution saves energy
    in IoT devices by preventing unnecessary uplink transmission. 5.3. Energy management
    in edge computing With the increasing number of IoT devices, the data produced
    by those devices is also escalating explosively. Processing efficiently those
    data then becomes a necessity in Green-IoT. Therefore, edge computing technologies
    emerge as a very attractive solution for energy management in IoT as they bridge
    the gap between the limited capability of low-powered devices and their computational
    demands. Edge computing allows the workload to be offloaded from the cloud to
    a location closer to the source of data that need to be processed. It offers the
    possibility to downstream data on behalf of cloud services and upstream data on
    behalf of IoT services. It consequently has the potential to extend the lifetime
    of battery constrained IoT devices, reduce the network traffic, increase the bandwidth,
    improve the privacy and achieve a considerable energy and communication delay
    saving. Different approaches have been proposed to achieve energy saving in Edge
    computing based IoT networks. Energy efficiency using edge computing can be achieved
    through different schemes : from offloading strategies to data reduction schemes
    as well as the efficient management of IoT devices and applications. In Sun and
    Ansari (2016), the authors tackled the scalability and energy consumption challenges
    that IoT faces by proposing a novel architecture including the cloud, mobile edge
    computing and IoT. It includes a framework which develops a selective offloading
    scheme to reduce the energy consumption of IoT devices and the overhead of edge
    devices. However, this architecture needs to overcome many challenges related
    to nodes identification by the virtual machines (especially if they change location)
    as well as the nodes and virtual machines migration. In fact, if a mobile node
    changes its location, the system should find an efficient strategy that can either
    migrates the virtual machine or not based on the QoS requirements of the application.
    In Min et al. (2019), the authors proposes a reinforcement learning based offloading
    scheme for IoT devices with energy harvesting. IoT devices select an edge device
    and their offloading rate according to their current battery level, the previous
    radio transmission rate to each edge device, and the predicted amount of harvested
    energy. This solution also includes a deep reinforcement-based offloading scheme
    to further accelerate the learning speed. In Liu et al. (2019), the authors also
    combined Edge Computing with deep reinforcement learning in an IoT-based energy
    management system to reduce the energy consumption in a smart home context. The
    proposed solution consists in an offline and an online phase. During the offline
    phase, a deep neural network is trained and a deep reinforcement learning model
    based on Q-learning is built and exploited during the online phase. The proposed
    solution proves to reduce the energy cost. Such solutions can be proposed to reduce
    the energy consumption of smart homes in a smart city context. In Azar et al.
    (2019), the authors focused on compressing the data collected by the edge device
    before their transmission. The proposed solution is based on an error-bounded
    lossy compressor designed for high performance applications with high data production.
    The proposed compression algorithm proved that the extracted data produced similar
    classification accuracy as the compressed data. 6. Research perspectives in IoT
    energy management In this section, we will discuss the use of approaches (see
    Fig. 5) like social IoT 5G-IoT and network softwarization as well as artificial
    intelligence and Cognitive Radio IoT in order to reduce the global energy consumption
    of IoT networks. We will also present the most recent solutions proposed for this
    purpose. In Table 8, we summarize the papers studied for each approach. Table

    for IoT. 6.1. Energy management techniques in 5G IoT With the emergence of 5G
    IoT, up to 120 billion devices will be connected all over the world. In order
    to meet the intense user demands, the devices will not be limited to smart phones
    but also home appliances, cars and other devices and will contribute to build
    a smart society. 5G IoT also claims a data rate increase up to 10 Gb/s and uses
    multiple technologies (e.g. massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO), small cells,
    beam forming, etc.) in order to support the tremendous number of users. Consequently,
    5G IoT suffers not only from spectrum efficiency but also energy efficiency problems
    that are causing negative effects on the environment and human health. This exponential
    growth has raised the energy consumption and carbon footprint of those networks
    to alarming rates which led both the industry and academia to turn towards green
    5G communications. In the literature, various studies discussed the importance
    of energy efficiency in 5G networks. In Buzzi et al. (2016), the authors presented
    an overview of energy-efficient techniques for 5G networks covering resource allocation,
    network planning, network deployment, hardware solutions, etc. In Gandotra et
    al. (2017), the authors presented a detailed survey on energy efficient cellular
    networks and proposed a spectrum sharing solution for prolonged battery life in
    IoT networks. In Costanzo and Masotti (2017), the authors provided an overview
    of several recent solutions for the wireless powering of devices exploiting either
    near-field or far-field techniques. These techniques are expected to have a leading
    role in the realization of 5G-IoT networks. In Dao et al. (2020), the authors
    proposed a probabilistic decay feature-based solution which focused on the energy
    consumption of spectrum sensing for IoT devices in 5G networks. In Zhang et al.
    (2016), the authors proposed an integrating and energy efficient system model
    for 5G-IoT that uses a massive MIMO array to replace the single remote antenna
    and cellular partition zooming (CPZ) mechanism as a select-and-sleep mechanism,
    shortening consequently the distance between the components and reducing the number
    of routers. 6.2. Energy efficient cognitive radio iot With the high number of
    IoT devices connected to the internet, the frequency spectrum used by those devices
    to communicate are getting crowded. Cognitive radio is an approach that aims to
    improve the usage efficiency of the radio electromagnetic spectrum by using all
    available frequencies. The cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless communication
    system that can be programmed and configured dynamically. It is built on a software-defined
    radio which is aware of its environment and uses the understanding-by-building
    methodology to learn from the environment (Haykin, 2005). It automatically detects
    the available channels in the wireless spectrum and accordingly adapts its transmission
    and reception parameters in order to ensure communication reliability and efficient
    utilization of the radio spectrum. Recently, the integration of cognitive radio
    and IoT have been widely studied as a potential solution for the bandwidth scarcity
    and devices high demand of uninterrupted connectivity. Compared to traditional
    IoT, spectrum sensing may consume much energy and reduce the transmission power
    of the network. Thus, reducing energy consumption in cognitive radio networks
    remains one of the most important challenges in IoT networks energy management.
    In Qureshi et al. (2017), the authors proposed an energy efficient protocol for
    cognitive radio IoT that reduces the number of handshakes, avoid re-transmission
    for reliable data communication and thus reduces communication time and enables
    energy transmission with high throughput. The reduction in communication time
    reduces considerably the energy consumption of the network. Other solutions focus
    on reducing the energy consumption using optimization algorithms. In Xu et al.
    (2017), the authors proposed an algorithm for joint time and power allocation
    optimization in green cognitive radio networks while in Liu et al. (2020), the
    authors focused on optimizing resources and sensing time in green cognitive IoT.
    The solution consists in having two groups of IoT nodes alternate between spectrum
    sensing and energy harvesting in order to compensate sensing energy consumption.
    The authors in Hao et al. (2016), proposed an algorithm to optimize the power
    allocation and sensing time during imperfect sensing in cooperative cognitive
    radio networks. Cognitive radios resolve the problem of high spectrum requirements,
    reduce waiting time and thus allow devices to consume less energy. On the other
    hand, cognitive radios may face interference issues between secondary and primary
    users and may also struggle to compromise between a good QoS and energy efficiency.
    6.3. Energy efficient network softwarization for iot IoT connects billions of
    devices to provide a variety of services (smart homes, smart agriculture, industry
    4.0, etc.). In order to achieve these services, IoT devices employ various protocols,
    communication ways, and format of data. The diversity and heterogeneity of IoT
    data and devices compared to traditional networks in addition to the need of security,
    privacy, storage and processing means that IoT networks require dynamic solutions
    for management, configuration, and flow scheduling solutions. Network softwarization
    in the form of Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) have emerged in order to overcome the previously discussed challenges. Networks
    softwarization consists in transforming telecommunication processing to a software-based
    environment. It is based on SDN which separates the control plane of the network
    and the data plane and thus separates the control from the forwarding in the network.
    The IoT network devices are employed for forwarding the data while the network
    controllers define the forwarding policies for the devices. These controllers
    can be organized in a centralized manner or in a hierarchical manner in order
    to prevent the controller from becoming a single point of failure and enhance
    the system’s fault tolerance (Eghbali and Lighvan, 2021). SDN integrated IoT can
    offer smart routing and load balancing as well as intelligent network traffic
    management and analysis. SDN can also provide a global view of IoT networks and
    improve the scalability and security of the networks. Network softwarization is
    also based on NFV which decouples the functions of network from the network hardware
    and runs it as virtual machines on containers. Network softwarization schemes
    such as NFV aim to replace energy consuming network hardware and improve the performances
    and capabilities of IoT systems. However, it is important to mention that these
    network functions are often run on servers which are the predominant energy consumers.
    Then, how does network softwarization impact the overall energy consumption of
    IoT networks and how can we reduce and optimize its energy consumption? To this
    end, various works studied the energy consumption in the network softwarization
    field. In Zemrane et al. (2018), the authors surveyed SDN-based solutions to improve
    IoT networks and describes SDN as a solution to IoT challenges focusing on energy
    saving, network management and mobility. In Naeem et al. (2020), the authors proposed
    an SDN-enabled routing protocol that not only efficiently utilizes the limited
    bandwidth cost to reduce the energy consumption but also achieves the QoS requirements
    for an industrial IoT network while in Yazdinejad et al. (2020), the authors proposed
    a cluster architecture using blockchain-based SDN controllers with distributed
    network management for IoT devices that provide a secure and energy-efficient
    mechanism for IoT devices in an SDN domain using a routing protocol. Numerous
    authors focused on reducing the energy consumption of SDN and NFV enabled data
    centers and thus, reducing the energy consumption of the whole IoT system. In
    Krishnan et al. (2015), the authors proposed an open stack based solution to enable
    policies that enforces constraints in the system with periodic event monitoring
    and dynamic resource management to minimize energy consumption in NFV data centers.
    In Liao and Wang (2018), the authors proposed an energy consumption control solution
    in SDN-based cloud data centers using the integration of virtual machine migration
    based on mixed single-parent genetic algorithm. Various SDN solutions achieved
    energy efficiency through energy efficient routing protocols. 6.4. Social IoT
    for energy management Social IoT is a paradigm that resulted from the integration
    of social networking concepts into the Internet. Social networks are able to connect
    a large number of individuals and this characteristic has previously inspired
    researchers in internet-related works (Atzori et al., 2012). Similarly to social
    networks, IoT networks use a variety of technologies to connect a large number
    of things which made the idea of combining these two concepts not only possible
    but also advisable. The concept of Social IoT was motivated by popular social
    networks over the Internet such as Facebook and Twitter. Therefore, it has attracted
    scientists and researchers in E-business, E-learning, sociology, psychology and
    networking. It has also caught the eyes of researchers in energy management as
    they consider it a promising solution in green networking. Since Device-to-Device
    communication and social network are two essential components in IoT, various
    authors studied energy management using Social IoT and proposed solutions to enhance
    the energy and spectrum efficiency in this context. For example, in Yang et al.
    (2020), the authors proposed a social interaction assisted resource sharing scheme
    for Device-to-Device communication, to improve the utilization of spectrum resources
    and thus, reduce the energy consumption in Green-IoT networks. The interconnection
    of IoT devices can also be used to efficiently harvest energy. For example, in
    Jiang et al. (2016), the authors proposed a social-aware energy harvesting Device-to-Device
    communications architecture that integrates energy harvesting technologies and
    social networking characteristics into Device-to-Device communication to improve
    the spectrum and energy efficiency for local data dissemination in 5G cellular
    networks. In Meng et al. (2017), the authors also worked on using social interaction
    in Device-to-Device communication but in this case to improve the efficiency of
    data exchange, sharing and delivery reducing thus, the energy consumption in the
    network. In Zhou et al. (2018), the authors proposed an energy efficient Cyber–Physical–Social
    system powered by IoT, where wireless network virtualization over SDN was adopted
    to enhance the service operation and the system management. In Lee et al. (2016),
    the authors propose an efficient pervasive interconnection technique to process
    and share information in IoT environment based on the human’s social network and
    the device’s sociality. In Al-Turjman (2019), the authors studied the use of smartphone
    sensors to contribute to smart social spaces as well as the energy consumption
    of femtocell, a potential communication technology for the realization in 5G-IoT.
    6.5. Intelligent energy management techniques for iot IoT networks are composed
    of physical devices such as vehicles, houses and any other item enhanced with
    sensors and software that enable data collection, distribution and analysis. However,
    due to the high number of IoT devices and their small sizes, they do not possess
    the computational power to process all the data collected hence, machine learning
    and big data technologies are efficient approaches to develop intelligent solutions
    to the collected data management. Big data technologies allow the collection and
    analysis of large amounts of data while machine learning studies algorithms and
    statistical models based on patterns and inferences that systems use to meet their
    goals (Machorro-Cano et al., 2020). Likewise, machine learning is a very reliable
    and robust approach, therefore, it is largely used in real-time applications.
    It is considered ideal for learning-based problems and is capable of identifying
    the background and characteristics of such problems to learn from them and execute
    actions based on the knowledge acquired thus increase system performances. Due
    to the high number of IoT devices, the energy consumed by IoT devices is huge.
    In addition, the world we live in faces a huge environmental crisis with climate
    change and high rates of air pollution, water pollution, etc. Reducing energy
    consumption in IoT networks is, then, one of the greatest challenges we might
    face. Researchers can exploit machine learning and intelligent solutions in order
    to predict energy consumption in IoT networks and applications. Table 9. The table
    shows the pros and cons of intelligent energy saving techniques. Intelligent energy
    saving techniques Pros Cons Machine learning -Help identify trends and patterns
    -Performances improve over time -Consumes energy while running the algorithms
    -Algorithms become obsolete when the data grows -Irrelevant and invaluable data
    can cause bad results Deep learning -Ideal for complex tasks -Supports large amounts
    of data -Bad quality data leads to bad results -Opacity of neural networks -More
    data security Various solutions have been proposed in order to reduce the energy
    consumption of IoT devices. However, those solutions are usually static, limited
    to a certain context and do not include taking smart and intelligent decisions.
    For example: in case of energy management of home appliances consumption, various
    optimizations solutions have been proposed. However, those solutions are depending
    on a certain context and do not consider a change of habit for the in-habitant.
    This is why, machine learning has emerged as promising approach to develop intelligent
    solutions for energy efficiency in smart homes as they are able, using smart meters
    data, to not only reduce the energy consumption but also adapt the decision making
    depending on the in-habitants’ habits. In fact, it would be interesting to exploit
    machine learning in order to adjust transport scheduling depending on air pollution
    or action depollution mechanisms if sensors detect a high pollution rate in water,
    etc. Hence, many researchers turned towards achieving Green-IoT at different network
    layers using intelligent solutions like machine learning and deep learning that
    proved their efficiency in other fields. Machine learning and deep learning, two
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, are often confused as deep learning is
    considered a part of machine learning but, we believe is important to differentiate
    them as they are two concepts used in different contexts and application fields.
    Machine learning can be defined as algorithms that provide a system the ability
    to automatically learn and improve its performances. Machine learning algorithms
    learn from data or experiences and apply what they have learned to make informed
    decisions. They usually involve human intervention to give feedback to the algorithm.
    Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised
    learning. Supervised learning uses the experiences learned from past data and
    apply it to new data using labeled examples to predict the future actions or events,
    while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled and unclassified data and helps the
    system find all kinds of unknown patterns in data. Another category of machine
    leaning is semi-supervised machine learning which uses both supervised and unsupervised
    learning. Typically, those algorithms use a small amount of labeled data and the
    rest is usually unlabeled data. Semi-supervised algorithms decrease the labeling
    effort and increase the learning accuracy of the system. Finally, reinforcement
    learning is an approach in which the learning methods consist in interacting with
    the environment by taking actions and receiving rewards or errors. Within a specific
    context, this method maximizes the system’s performances and automatically determines
    its ideal behavior. Deep learning algorithms are an evolution of machine learning
    algorithms as they use a programmable layered structure of algorithms called an
    artificial neural network. These artificial neural networks enable systems to
    make accurate decisions without human intervention. Deep learning differs from
    the other machine learning algorithms as it is able to accomplish complex tasks
    using unstructured data, process a large amount of data and learn efficiently
    without human intervention. In what follows, we will present machine learning
    and deep learning based solutions employed to reduce the energy consumption of
    IoT networks. 6.5.1. Machine learning-based energy saving techniques With the
    emergence of IoT and the exploding number of IoT devices, the volume of the data
    generated by IoT systems also increases considerably. Consequently, machine learning
    techniques have emerged to use the data generated by IoT devices and make IoT
    application more intelligent. However, due to the high number of IoT devices,
    the energy consumed by those devices has also increased considerably, thus, energy
    saving has become a priority for IoT systems designers and end-users. This motivated
    researchers to study the use of machine learning in order to create green smart
    and sustainable IoT-network applications. The amount of works concerning the use
    of machine learning to achieve energy saving is large. To help reduce the energy
    consumption, machine learning can be used in energy saving IoT applications such
    as Smart Buildings (Zhao et al., 2018, Thomas and Cook, 2016), Smart Energy (O’Dwyer
    et al., 2019, Sheikhi et al., 2015), Smart Water (Mounce et al., 2015). Other
    works focus on saving energy by efficiently transmitting data and reducing the
    number of transmitted packets (Lavassani et al., 2018). While in Paris and Anisi
    (2019), the authors focused on energy efficient mobility prediction using machine
    learning. This shows if the data features are known and with the available datasets,
    machine learning algorithms prove to be an interesting solution that can be used
    and adapted to different aspects of energy saving in IoT networks. 6.5.2. Deep
    learning-based energy saving techniques Deep Learning is a promising approach
    for energy management in IoT networks. As shown in Table 9, it differs from machine
    learning as it provides better performances with large scale data. Deep learning
    algorithms are self-directed on data-analysis and can automatically extract new
    features for problems in contrast to machine learning algorithms which depend
    on the extracted and already identified features. Deep learning has been used
    in several works related to energy saving. In Liu et al. (2019), a deep reinforcement
    learning-based energy scheduling was proposed to deal with uncertainty and intermittence
    of energy supplies. In Hu et al., 2018, Liessner et al., 2018 a deep reinforcement
    learning approach was proposed to obtain an energy management strategy for a hybrid
    electric vehicle. On the other hand, in Wu et al. (2018a), a deep Q-learning based
    energy management strategy for power split Hybrid Electric Buses is proposed.
    As shown in the works presented previously, deep learning can be used in numerous
    energy saving applications. However, it is more suitable for large scale applications
    that require constant learning and that needs to adapt to the state of its environment.
    6.6. Application-based energy management IoT has revolutionized the way we live.
    However, IoT technologies face several challenges such as the increase in energy
    consumption and carbon footprint of IoT nodes. Therefore, IoT applications must
    be smart, eco-friendly and sustainable and with the recent development of Green
    IoT, it has become a tool towards achieving green and sustainable societies. Various
    IoT solutions have been proposed where IoT is an enabler for greening several
    fields of our society such as waste management, retail and logistics, smart streets,
    etc. For smart waste management, the authors in Shyam et al. (2017) proposed a
    smart waste management system where the waste level in waste bins is communicated
    and an optimized and energy efficient route is proposed to the workers. In Kazmi
    et al. (2020), the authors proposed a smart street framework where streetlights
    are powered by solar panels and are efficiently monitored and maneuvered by IoT.
    The streetlights operate at different intensities depending on the traffic flow
    rate and the absence or presence of sunlight and vehicles. In the proposed solution,
    streetlights are also equipped with sensors to help monitor air quality. Throughout
    the years, it has also been proven that traditional infrastructures that help
    simplify human beings daily lives (e.g. public transportation systems, home appliances,
    cars, factories, etc.) waste a tremendous amount of energy. Therefore, in order
    to continue using these vehicles and infrastructures without draining our planet’s
    energy resources, greening using IoT becomes a top priority and constitutes a
    step towards achieving green and sustainable societies. Consequently, various
    solution have been proposed as alternatives to traditional and polluting applications.
    In Chen et al. (2016) the authors discussed the use of Intelligent Transportation
    Systems to achieve energy saving and what changes both consumers and decision-makers
    should take in order to reduce the energy consumption of public transport systems.
    In Franzitta et al. (2017), the authors studied the use of renewable energies
    to power public transport (buses) and reduce the energetic dependence on fossil
    fuels by replacing diesel vehicles with hydrogen-powered vehicles. Numerous works
    specialized in energy management for trains and railways station such as Şengör
    et al., 2017, Kampeerawat and Koseki, 2017. Personal vehicles are also concerned
    with energy management. In Giliberto et al. (2019), the authors proposed a solution
    based on fuzzy logic aimed at prolonging the battery life of electric bikes. The
    use of electric bikes (e-bikes) is particularly interesting in IoT networks as
    they can be used as mobile node for energy or data transmission. Reducing energy
    consumption in buildings also caught the eye of researchers (Esther and Kumar,
    2016). For example, in Rahim et al., 2018, Ożadowicz, 2017, the authors proposed
    solutions to minimize energy consumption of homes and building appliances while
    causing the minimum discomfort to the user. In Rahim et al. (2018), the authors
    proposed a hybrid solution based on three heuristic algorithms for home energy
    management in a smart building while in Ożadowicz (2017), the authors proposed
    an approach to both physical and logical organization of an active demand side
    management system for building-integrated prosumer microgrids based on IoT and
    standard building automation and control systems (BACS) Table 10. The table shows
    recommendations on how to use the energy management techniques presented in our
    survey to meet iot applications requirements. IoT application Requirements Techniques

    will present recommendations and indications to IoT system designers on which
    techniques presented in our survey can help achieve the requirements of an IoT
    application in an energy efficient way. The application fields of IoT in a single
    domain are diverse thus, the requirements can differ from one application to another
    in the same field. However, a number of these techniques can be used for different
    applications. For example, using battery-less devices with backscatter communications,
    simultaneously transmitting power and information with SWIPT, in addition to periodically
    alternating between sleep and wake-up states for IoT devices with duty-cycling
    and wake-up radios that can be combined with machine learning techniques to optimize
    the sleep and wake-up time. These techniques are very promising and are use in
    scenarios where the device do not need to be constantly active. 5G technology
    is integrated with IoT networks in order to boost the communication and response
    time as well as the capacity of IoT networks. Security is also crucial for IoT
    applications that use private and critical data such as smart homes, healthcare
    and industrial IoT. IoT system designers should consider security at different
    layers of the network with security protocols as well as network softwarization
    that not only allows to save energy by replacing physical security devices but
    also to have powerful security mechanisms. Green energy sources also need to be
    exploited for various applications in order to power the devices and ensure the
    availability of the devices and real-time data. In Table 10, we summerize our
    recommendations for each IoT application. 7.1. Smart home IoT is drastically transforming
    how households are managed. Devices and home appliances are equipped with communication
    interfaces and are remotely and automatically controlled in order to offer a comfortable
    experience for the in-habitants. In this regard, smart homes services need to
    be available at any time and with low latency. Therefore, processing data at edge,
    fog and cloud level allows to have a quick response (Mao et al., 2018). Task offloading
    at different levels of the platform also enhances the availability of the service
    and allows a quick recovery in case one of the components stops working (Chowdhury
    et al., 2020). If smart home sensor data are communicated to the edge, fog or
    cloud for processing and since communication costs more energy than local computation,
    energy efficient data communication schemes need to developed for smart home through
    lightweight protocols, data reduction, data aggregation schemes (Pattamaset and
    Choi, 2021) and social IoT (Kim and Lee, 2015) to exploit the interconnection
    between the devices to find energy efficient communication routes. Smart homes
    solutions should also be context-aware and flexible thus, these applications can
    use machine and deep learning techniques in order to adapt to the user’s needs
    and reduce the energy consumption (Jo and Yoon, 2018). 7.2. Agriculture IoT was
    introduced in agriculture to improve agricultural yield and quality for the increasing
    world population. IoT is used to collect real-time information about temperature,
    humidity and soil and transmit them to a platform where they will be used to monitor
    the production. IoT devices in smart agriculture applications need to be reliable
    through weather conditions and available for years without the need for battery
    replacement. In addition to green energy sources and intelligent sleep/wake-up
    techniques, energy efficiency in agriculture IoT devices can also be achieved
    through using mobile vehicles such as tractors as power relays and data sinks
    and ensure the availability of the application data. A combination of sleep/wake-up
    techniques and UAV-based mobile energy harvesting is proposed in Jawad et al.
    (2019) for a smart agriculture system. Agricultural application are in constant
    expansion. Therefore, sensor data management is a key challenge that need to be
    taken into consideration through different devices organization schemes as well
    as data reduction and flexible data collection strategies. 7.3. Healthcare IoT
    is progressively integrated in healthcare in order to improve the access and enhance
    the quality of care. IoT healthcare applications aim to achieve excellent healthcare
    services at affordable costs. IoT in healthcare can be used to monitor a patient
    behavior and extract information that will improve well-being, healthcare and
    patient support. Patients’ medical information are critical, this is why healthcare
    application should protect data with secure transmission protocols. Healthcare
    IoT application should also offer real-time information about the patient’s health
    condition with low response time which will be possible with the democratization
    of 5G networks. In order to ensure efficient patient support and services, IoT
    healthcare services should be available even if one of the components stops working
    and devices should be able to function through arduous condition for a long period
    of time (e.g. wearable heart rate monitor). One of the most suitable approaches
    presented in our survey to meet those requirements is social IoT. IoT devices
    in healthcare are often mobile, the connection and relationships between these
    devices can be exploited in order to ensure the availability of critical information
    and the system’s fault tolerance. In Al-Turjman (2019), the authors used 5G and
    exploited Social IoT to ensure service availability for smart devices. The social
    aspect of IoT devices can also be exploited for power transmission between devices
    (Pei et al., 2020). For healthcare IoT applications that use wearable devices,
    human motion and mechanical energy harvesting can constitute the perfect solution
    to further increase the devices’ and network’s lifetime (Wu et al., 2021). 7.4.
    Industrial IoT IoT has recently made its way to the industry. It refers to the
    interconnection of all the industrial assets and aims to collect the maximum data
    from these assets to achieve optimal industrial operations. Industrial applications
    that are safety-critical and used for control and decision making need to be available
    and reliable at any time. In order to achieve industrial IoT applications requirements
    of real-time performance, 5G communication technologies (Slalmi et al., 2021)
    that offer low latency can be combined with CR-IoT (Abbas et al., 2020) to satisfy
    end-to-end deadlines of the tasks and optimize the frequency spectrum utilization
    and thus, reduce the waiting time. Edge and Fog computing can be used to perform
    energy-hungry computation at the edge of the network (as in Hsu et al. (2019))
    with low latency instead of handling them on the cloud which induces a longer
    transmission time and a higher energy consumption. With the large amounts of data
    generated in industrial IoT applications, an compromise must be made between the
    high availability of industrial IoT and the high energy consumption of data transmission.
    Therefore, IoT devices data should be organized and reduced through data aggregation
    and reduction techniques presented in our survey to reduce the transmission data
    energy consumption and latency in industrial IoT applications. Similarly to smart
    homes, industrial IoT applications should use artificial intelligence in order
    to offer a flexible and context-aware experience and exploit mobile devices in
    order to power other devices through intelligent mobile energy transfer strategies
    (Park et al., 2020a). 8. Conclusion With the constant need of human being to have
    a safe, comfortable and stable environment, Green IoT emerged as a key and hot
    technology. It guarantees a decrease in the energy consumption of IoT. In the
    coming years, the number of IoT devices will be even higher as big companies (e.g.
    Google, Amazon, etc.) are investing in the sector. Thus, companies and organization
    should develop IoT solutions from an eco-friendly and energy efficient standpoint.
    Re-usability and recycling of IoT devices should also be a focal point of the
    research of Green IoT to avoid the energy resulting from the process of producing
    new smart devices. Therefore, in order to achieve Green and sustainable IoT, there
    is a crucial need for new IoT policies and standardization that include the principles
    of Green IoT. In our survey, we have focused on gathering a large range of energy
    management technologies that will help achieve Green IoT systems. We have also
    discussed recent trends and new perspectives in IoT networks energy management
    that were not discussed previously in the literature. It is important to mention
    that other factors like QoS and security can further increase the energy consumption
    of Green IoT networks. For the longest time, in order to offer the best experience
    to the user, energy consuming solutions that achieve a good QoS was often privileged
    to a green solution that could lack in an aspect of QoS. Security is also another
    energy consuming factor of Green IoT. With the high expansion of IoT networks
    and high IoT nodes connectivity, the cybersecurity risks increase accordingly.
    Personal and private data will also circulate through IoT networks. Therefore,
    it is important to address the cybersecurity issues. Declaration of Competing

    \a\nAbstract: The term intelligent agriculture, or smart farming, typically involves\
    \ the incorporation of\ncomputer science and information technologies into the\
    \ traditional notion of farming. The latter\nutilizes plain machinery and equipment\
    \ used for many decades and the only signiﬁcant improvement\nmade over the years\
    \ has been the introduction of automation in the process. Still, at the beginning\
    \ of\nthe new century, there are ways and room for further vast improvements.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, the low\ncost of rather advanced sensors and small-scale devices,\
    \ now even connected to the Internet of\nThings (IoT), allowed them to be introduced\
    \ in the process and used within agricultural production\nsystems. New and emerging\
    \ technologies and methodologies, like the utilization of cheap network\nstorage,\
    \ are expected to advance this development. In this sense, the main goals of this\
    \ paper may be\nsummarized as follows: (a) To identify, group, and acknowledge\
    \ the current state-of-the-art research\nknowledge about intelligent agriculture\
    \ approaches, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful\ndata sources categories,\
    \ and (c) to describe current efﬁcient data processing and utilization aspects\n\
    from the perspective of the main trends in the ﬁeld.\nKeywords: smart agriculture\
    \ survey; intelligent knowledge acquisition; machine learning methodologies\n\
    1. Introduction\nOver the last hundred years technological achievements, like\
    \ the utilization of heavy machinery\nand the industrialization of the production\
    \ chain, introduced major changes to the agricultural working\nstatus quo. These\
    \ changes, although pivotal for the current development of agriculture as we know\n\
    it until the recent years, are not considered to be the last resort of agriculture,\
    \ as world population\nfeeding needs increase over time. The term intelligent\
    \ agriculture, or smart farming, typically involves\nincorporation of computer\
    \ science and information technologies into the traditional notion of farming.\n\
    It allows the creation of large volumes of data, with the progressive introduction\
    \ of intelligence in the\nprocess of their transformation into organized information,\
    \ and the extraction of meaningful semantic\nknowledge, as the last link of this\
    \ virtual chain of actions.\nFactors such as climate change, demographic parameters,\
    \ population movements, and overall\naging and migration issues between rural\
    \ and urban areas, all play a signiﬁcant role and come into play\nwhen dealing\
    \ with intelligent agriculture research. Speciﬁcally, climate parameters like\
    \ temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil moisture have signiﬁcant impact on most\
    \ of the aforementioned factors, thus the\nexploitation of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and machine learning techniques towards their efﬁcient, reliable\nand accurate\
    \ prediction is of great importance in modern agricultural activities, since they\
    \ may heavily\naffect the corresponding production costs and can assist in minimizing\
    \ environmental constraints.\nHaving declared the necessity and importance of\
    \ the discussed domain, we may further elaborate\non the speciﬁc aims of this\
    \ paper. First of all, it is rather true that, being a modern application domain,\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278; doi:10.3390/su11123278\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n2 of 23\nmost of the corresponding research literature\
    \ on intelligent agriculture has been published over the\nrecent years. Still,\
    \ there are important research works, included herein, that deal with aspects\
    \ either\ndirectly or indirectly related to the modern ﬁeld. Considering this\
    \ context, our research aims to achieve\nthe following objectives: (a) To identify,\
    \ group, and acknowledge the research knowledge about current\nintelligent agriculture\
    \ that are state-of-the-art, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful data\n\
    source categories, and (c) to describe current efﬁcient data processing and utilization\
    \ aspects from the\nperspective of the main trends in the ﬁeld.\nOur main motivation\
    \ behind the production of this research work was our belief that\nidentifying\
    \ how computer science interprets intelligent agriculture over time, geographical\
    \ space,\nand methodologies may aid the production of new, advanced, and innovative\
    \ research with the\nobjective of covering areas that have received less attention\
    \ up until now and may introduce brand\nnew applications in the process. Thus,\
    \ we summarized and organized in a researcher-friendly tabular\nmanner important\
    \ or pioneer related research works deriving from diverse agricultural intelligence\n\
    domains. In the following sections, we initially focus on different data collection\
    \ techniques, ranging\nfrom meteorological data at the macro- (i.e., geographical\
    \ region), meso- (i.e., ﬁeld), and micro-level\n(i.e., speciﬁc intra-ﬁeld areas),\
    \ to GIS and remote sensing data, image data from drones, or even\ninnovative\
    \ crowd-sourcing activities. Moreover, we present the prevailing data processing\
    \ and\nutilization methodologies that exploit notions from the machine learning\
    \ computer science ﬁelds.\nWe categorize them into two main groups, namely machine\
    \ learning algorithms focusing on numerical\ndata processing, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ exemplars from the drone or even satellite imagery domain.\nOn top of that,\
    \ efﬁcient environmental monitoring suggests innovatice procedures of meaningful\n\
    knowledge extraction through various observation and evaluation techniques. In\
    \ the typical case,\n“machines”, under the generic auspice of computer science,\
    \ support and preserve acquisition and\nmanagement of such information into accessible\
    \ semantic modules [1], whereas the goal of integrating\nthe task of monitoring,\
    \ physical computing, information technologies and knowledge representation\n\
    has been served in the past by the semantic sensor network ontology and it’s many\
    \ variations [2].\nIn this framework, the two main factors are formed around the\
    \ tasks of a knowledge base creation and\ncorresponding data visualization.\n\
    It should be also noted at this point that this paper attempts to conduct a broad\
    \ modern survey of\nthe illustrated topics and, thus, form a somehow point of\
    \ reference for fellow researchers. It attempts\nto study the existence, importance\
    \ and impact of the notion of agriculture information handling\nmethodologies\
    \ within the scope of the modern and quite popular “smart” agriculture computing\n\
    framework. Still, this is a tedious task to tackle, since mainly given to its\
    \ inherent diversity, the term\nis nowadays widely acknowledged and has become\
    \ a topic of interest in several multi-disciplinary\nsub-ﬁelds, ranging from traditional\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to contextual semantics and other\nrecently\
    \ emerged innovative applications. Focus is also given on the identiﬁed challenges\
    \ and potential\nfuture research directions that emerge from the herein discussed\
    \ approaches. To the best of our recent\nknowledge, researcher, academics, but\
    \ also interested stakeholders and even farmers themselves\nare nowadays eager\
    \ to obtain comprehensive and perspicacious written reviews of related studies\n\
    on modern smart agriculture information handling. Thus, this survey attempts to\
    \ provide a rich\nsource of ideas for them and a good point of reference for those\
    \ who want to start studying related\nsub-ﬁelds in depth within the framework\
    \ imposed by the latest related disciplines advances, namely\nagriculture and\
    \ informatics. Among its goals is the identiﬁcation of different types of methodologies\n\
    in agricultural informatics and the provision of an overview on the deﬁnition\
    \ and utilization of related\nresearch approaches exploited within recent approaches\
    \ and applications.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section\
    \ 2, we present related research works\nconcerning the various data sources utilized\
    \ with respect to agricultural aspects. Then, in Section 3,\nwe present the main\
    \ machine learning methodologies that may be efﬁciently applied on agricultural\n\
    data. Section 4 discusses ad-hoc topics that are built on top of the data and\
    \ algorithmic fronts, such as\nintelligent knowledge acquisition, data visualization,\
    \ and crowd-wisdom exploitation. Finally, a short\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n\
    3 of 23\ndiscussion together with drawn conclusions and future prospects relating\
    \ to the proposed framework\nare presented within Section 5 that concludes the\
    \ paper.\n2. Data Sources and Collection\nThe natural conditions of agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds and their neighbor areas are characterized by their\nmeteorological, climatic,\
    \ and soil attributes. Information Technologies (IT) have been shown to\nimprove\
    \ agricultural productivity in a number of ways. Furthermore, the study of conditions\
    \ is\nusually performed through different type of datasets and in a multi-level\
    \ scale. More speciﬁcally,\nin the following we reason agricultural monitoring\
    \ as a classiﬁcation of four concrete methods for data\nretrieval on the scope\
    \ of analysis and machine learning. In Section 2.1 we present works related to\n\
    on-site climatic sensory observations that largely produce numerical data, in\
    \ contrast to Section 2.2\nthat exhibits spatially correlated physical factors.\
    \ Additionally, satellite imagery presents a wealth of\nnumerical, spatial-aware,\
    \ and image data from remote sensing acquisition techniques (Section 2.3),\nwhich\
    \ is enriched through the advent of aerial imagery applications in agricultural\
    \ monitoring.\nLastly, application of drone-aided technology (Section 2.4) uniﬁes\
    \ all physical characteristics of the\napproximate environment on an accessible\
    \ research context.\n2.1. Meteorological Sensory Data\nManaging climatic and environmental\
    \ challenges in relation to wine production can be\nimplemented by recording and\
    \ assessing meteorological data. Hunter et al. [3] studied the impact on\nmicroclimatic\
    \ conditions using the distribution of local conditions for existing vineyards.\
    \ The vines\nhave a distinctive topology that is subjective to atmospheric, climatic\
    \ and soil conditions of their given\nlocation. The scientists studied different\
    \ orientations of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz variety in South\nAfrica and tested\
    \ their distinct environmental factors in three levels - macro, meso and micro.\
    \ They’ve\nrecorded temperature, radiation, rainfall and wind speed (at the macro\
    \ level), ambient photosynthetic\nactive radiation on top of the vines, wind speed\
    \ and direction (at the meso level) and ambient\ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ (at the micro level). Additionally, they measured relative humidity,\nleaf temperature,\
    \ photosynthetic photo ﬂux density (PPFD), transpiration, CO2 concentration and\n\
    photosynthetic activity at the canopy level, six weeks after the berry colouring\
    \ phase. Hunter et al.\nmanaged to provide novel knowledge on the effect of row\
    \ orientation on vineyard meso-, macro- and\nmicroclimate in addition to vine\
    \ physiological status. Their results produced quantitative data related\nto the\
    \ complex relationship between row orientation and physiological characteristics\
    \ of vines.\nThe vision of sustainable management in agriculture was studied by\
    \ Kaewmard and Saiyod [4]\nby introducing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) control\
    \ system. They deployed several experimental\nsensing devices to monitor crop\
    \ irrigation and produced a platform for water management, employing\nmobile application\
    \ and services along with a wireless communication platform under the scope of\
    \ the\nInternet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, their experimental results were\
    \ related to the plants’ growth rate\nindicating highly accurate measurements\
    \ based on soil moisture, air humidity and temperature sensors.\nReal-time data\
    \ collection and distribution is an important aspect on the direction of applied\n\
    monitoring in agriculture. Under this scope Kiyoshi et al. [5] proposed a decision\
    \ support system based\non multilevel sensor measurements. Their interoperable\
    \ applications were capable of dynamically\nquerying sensor metadata and analyzing\
    \ historical weather data. Kiyoshi et al. produced predictions\nconcerning the\
    \ evaluation of various weather scenarios by implementing crop modeling and simulations.\n\
    Furthermore, the authors used heterogenous data sources, promoting efficient crop\
    \ management and\ncontrol and subsequently assisting farmers’ operation cycles\
    \ at all stages of cultivation.\nThe research of Bock et al. [6] is related to\
    \ the actual grapevine yield and quality and is\nbased on long-term data accumulation\
    \ for over the last two centuries (between years 1805–2010)\nin Germany. The authors\
    \ analyzed long-term time series of grapevine yield in yield per hectare\n(hL/ha)\
    \ measurements and the sugar content of must (i.e., the grape juice) in Degree\
    \ Oechsle (◦Oe)\nmeasurements, as well as climate data through bibliographical\
    \ references and sensor recordings.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n4 of 23\n\
    It should be noted that Degree Oechsle measures the relative sweetness of the\
    \ must and shows how\nmuch more 1 L of must weighs, compared to 1 L of water,\
    \ whereas the entire dataset was homogenized\nby monthly observations depending\
    \ on available resources. This long-term, multi-factoral research\nresulted into\
    \ a veriﬁed upward trend in both yield and must sugar content over the examined\n\
    time period. The researchers distinguished further between the anthropogenic and\
    \ climatic impacts\non yield in relation to temperature; their study underlines\
    \ the need for continuous and calibrated\nmeasurements of morphological and chemical\
    \ characteristics, along with meteorological conditions\nduring vine production\
    \ in relation to their productivity.\nAnother WSN agricultural monitoring platform\
    \ was introduced by Tarange et al. [7]. The researches\nproposed an automated\
    \ control system for crop irrigation based on soil moisture and temperature senors.\n\
    In particular, the sensor information was collected from the nodes in a continuous\
    \ manner, allowing\nthe system to control irrigation uniformly and reducing the\
    \ fresh water consumption without the need\nof human interaction.\nAndreoli et\
    \ al. [8] developed a simulation related to vine growth parametric processes for\n\
    the understanding of plant conditions at vineyard scale of Vitis vinifera L. Nebbiolo\
    \ of NW Italy.\nThe simulation is based on experimental observations from model\
    \ vineyards. Their model required\na set of meteorological data, soil parameters,\
    \ vine’s physical characteristics, geographic information\nand variety characteristics,\
    \ which was then evaluated through existing empirical equations. Recording\nfrequency\
    \ is adjusted depending on the nature of the data and the sampling took place\
    \ on 15 grid\npoints over the Piedmontese territory in mixed elevation. Furthermore,\
    \ the IVINE model showed that\nmeteorological data produce more stable results\
    \ and contrary to vine growth and phenological phases\nthat were less accurately\
    \ predicted.\nWater is one of the fundamental aspects of life on earth and provides\
    \ precious nutrients for\nmany types of crop. Yuan and Zhen [9] estimated water\
    \ consumption by agricultural activities in\nChina. More specifically their research\
    \ focused on agricultural water and irrigation net consumption for the\nperiod\
    \ between 1984 to 2008 in the Hebei province. Meteorological data were used to\
    \ calculate a baseline\nof evapotranspiration (ET0), along with grain yield to\
    \ find the actual evapotranspiration. Atmospheric\nand ground measurements included\
    \ daily average temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, duration\nof sunshine,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, vapor pressure, and wind speed, which emanate from 55\
    \ weather\nstations located in the Hebei area. Their study showed a spatial pattern\
    \ of increased ET0 that is\npossibly related to intensiﬁed agricultural activity\
    \ and increasing temperatures. This work points\nout the use of meteorological\
    \ monitoring (i.e., large scale monitoring, in this particular case) that\nmay\
    \ help researchers further understand the interdependent relations of climatic\
    \ conditions and\nhuman activities.\nThe work of Tagami et al. [10] was related\
    \ to the development and application of Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSN) in viticulture,\
    \ under the notion of developing appropriate management practices.\nThey deployed\
    \ a use-case scenario based on a network of highly usable hardware components\
    \ for\ndata collection. Their study was mainly focused on networking and software\
    \ infrastructures that\nsupport an array of prototype weather stations and sensors;\
    \ the latter collected information relevant to\nrainfall, wind speed and direction,\
    \ barometric pressure, solar radiation, temperature, and humidity.\nIn addition\
    \ to atmospheric variables authors took into consideration soil matrix potential\
    \ from soil\nmoisture by using soil measurement probes buried at two different\
    \ depths. The researchers achieved\nto minimize data loss and improve data accessibility\
    \ on the scope of long-term data acquisition system.\nFurthermore, the array of\
    \ sensors was operating properly and collecting reliable data due to the correct\n\
    placement of sensors within the vineyards.\nOne of the early adopters of WSN in\
    \ viticulture were Marino et al. [11], where they proposed the\nintegration of\
    \ specialized electronic sensors for climate monitoring and soil assessment. They\
    \ deployed\nan experimental network for on-site automatic data acquisition, based\
    \ on distributed processes.\nThe network was implemented with the introduction\
    \ of Electronic Zonal Stations (EZS) to a web\nplatform and a connected database.\
    \ The EZS consist of a data logger collecting measurements from the\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n5 of 23\nstations’ sensors, and an Ultra High Frequency (UHF)\
    \ radio modem that forwards the readings to the\nbase station. The produced dataset\
    \ is organized in registers that comprise measurements (temperature,\nrelative\
    \ humidity, leaf humidity, soil temperature, solar radiation, rain gauge, and\
    \ biological\nparameters), along with date and time. Ultimately, they provided\
    \ a low-cost and low power\nconsumption network that offers real measurements\
    \ in order to consistently validate various biological\nand ecological models\
    \ used in smart viticulture.\nIndices related to grapevine development were employed\
    \ by Neethling et al. [12] while analyzing\nnatural trends of climatic and bioclimatic\
    \ parameters for the main grapevine varieties in France.\nTheir research took\
    \ place at the Loire valley in northeast France, where the wine was determined\n\
    by the unique characteristics of the approximate geographical environment. The\
    \ research team used\ntemperature data from 7 stations in the area, but not situated\
    \ within the vineyards. More speciﬁcally,\ntemperature measurements produced several\
    \ indices: Mean and seasonal temperature, growing\ndegree-days index (GDD), Huglin\
    \ index (HI), cool-night index (CI), and Diurnal Temperature Range\n(DTR). Additionally,\
    \ they gathered monthly rainfall data from 5 stations within the research area,\n\
    which used to calculate total rainfall, dry-spell-mean index, and number of days\
    \ of heavy rainfall.\nMoreover, they dissected the indices in 2 groups (climatic\
    \ and bioclimatic), which assisted them\nto conclude on a temperature rise during\
    \ the growing season (April–September). Consequently,\nNeethling et al. used a\
    \ large meteorological dataset that helped them indicate the inﬂuence of climatic\n\
    and bioclimatic variations in berry composition of the main grape varieties cultivated\
    \ in the Loire valley.\nTaking above research efforts a step further, Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technologies are supportive\nto conventional methods of data\
    \ acquisition through the prism of prediction models development.\nParra Plazas\
    \ et al. [13] proposed a Computational Intelligence (CI) model using IoT technologies\
    \ in the\nnotion of climate monitoring. Their dataset originates from weather\
    \ stations in a time-line between 2009\nand 2011. The variables under study are\
    \ precipitation (mm of water), atmospheric pressure (mm Hg),\nrelative humidity\
    \ (HR%), temperature (Co), wind speed (km/h), and wind direction (azimuth degrees).\n\
    The data collected during the aforementioned time period produced a knowledge\
    \ base on which two\nCI models were deployed. The models demonstrated that further\
    \ experimentation is needed with\nan ampliﬁed dataset in order to improve its\
    \ responsiveness.\nHaving said that, it is rather true that modern research on\
    \ agricultural production and adaptation\ntends to be based on multi-disciplinary\
    \ methodologies focused both on quantitative and qualitative\nmeasurements. Statistics\
    \ derived solely from arithmetic/numerical data cannot provide the excepted\n\
    results on production growth and durability. Thus, most recent studies deployed\
    \ several different\nmethodologies in the ﬁelds of geography, remote sensing,\
    \ and informatics that largely enable\nresearchers to further employ state-of-the-art\
    \ agricultural analysis on top of the aforementioned\nmethodologies and approaches.\
    \ The latter are discussed in the next subsection.\n2.2. Location-Based Data\n\
    Nowadays, the so-called Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a powerful role\
    \ in spatial\nanalysis. The investigation and management of spatial variability\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds consist of\nmapping homogeneous management zones with\
    \ the use of proximal and remote sensing methods that\nprovide increased resolution\
    \ and accuracy of spatial characterization of physical parameters. The basis\n\
    of geographical integration into Decision Support Systems (DSS) introduced by\
    \ Tian-en et al. [14]\ndescribing spatial work-ﬂows and their components, under\
    \ the scope of precision farming optimization.\nTheir proposed web platform was\
    \ based on data structures derived form sampling areas. The data\nare soil, water\
    \ and climatic factors and are accompanied by location-based data in order to\
    \ assist\nagricultural management within the the study areas.\nFurthermore, it\
    \ may reduce on-site sampling costs, and improve management of wine quality\n\
    in relation to soil, crop, and yield features. In this framework, the notion of\
    \ spatial variability of\nmeteorological conditions is presented by Matese et\
    \ al. [15] for the distinction of best vintages.\nThe authors presented novel\
    \ results on spatial variability and its deﬁnition at different topographic\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n6 of 23\nscales. They deployed several sensors\
    \ (temperature, humidity, solar radiation) within the study areas\nand developed\
    \ varied analytic methodologies depending on the climatic scale (meso, topo/macro,\n\
    micro 1 and micro 2). All factors assessed within the context of spatial variation\
    \ as dependant\ncategorical variables, which are designed hierarchically in order\
    \ to justify their meaning in parametric\nmonitoring assessment. Their results\
    \ illustrate the effects of several sources of spatial variation in\nviticulture\
    \ and presented a “proof of concept” methodology for on-site application. Additionally,\n\
    the in-ﬁeld measurements potentially provide support to production and disease\
    \ management\nfor research and technical purposes. Finally, Matese et al. highlight\
    \ the need to further develop\nmultifactorial means of analysis on the scope of\
    \ agro-meteorological monitoring in addition to the\nmanagement of large environmental\
    \ datasets.\nBai et al. [16] proposed a multi-sensor system that manages plant\
    \ phenotypic data, which based\non ﬁve sensor modules to measure crop canopy traits\
    \ from agricultural terroirs. The research team\nalso assessed data related to\
    \ canopy reﬂectance spectra thoughout RGB images on soybean and wheat\nﬁelds.\
    \ The produced integrated sensor system used solar radiation and air temperature/relative\n\
    humidity sensors, ultrasonic distance sensors, infrared thermal radiometers, NDVI\
    \ sensors, portable\nspectrometers and RGB cameras that then were synchronized\
    \ the analyzed data in order to provide\ninter-correlations among the sensor-based\
    \ traits, validated of the reliability of the apparatus in data\ncollection. Their\
    \ study indicated the useful capabilities of location based sensor systems during\n\
    plant breeding.\nGeo-statistics as a tool for monitoring agricultural practices\
    \ was the subject of study of\nIrimia et al. [17]. They used the daily averages\
    \ of temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration\nvariables for the period\
    \ between 1961 and 2013 at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees (i.e., 10 × 10\
    \ km)\nin order to produce a spatial distribution map assessing the climatic suitability\
    \ of wine production\nbased on oenoclimatic aptitude index (IAOe). Their ﬁndings\
    \ highlighted the negative evolution of\nclimate suitability for wine production\
    \ within the areas of study and where the changes are likely to\ngenerate climatic\
    \ classiﬁcation in wine growing regions in Romania.\nThe simulation of surface\
    \ ﬂows on the basis of erosion management was examined by\nRodrigo-Comino et al.\
    \ [18] in order to estimate soil erodibility, runoff discharge and erosion rate.\n\
    They’ve implemented several rainfall simulations in their study areas and produced\
    \ statistical results\nused in conjunction with spatial coefﬁcients, which indicate\
    \ spatial distribution of the mechanical\neffects of water in soil composition.\
    \ Furthermore, authors produced proportional symbol maps that\nvisualized the\
    \ results of spatial coefﬁcients, thus indicating the high soil and water losses\
    \ within the\nstudy areas.\nFinally, spatial characteristics of different energy\
    \ consumption patterns in agriculture were\npresented by Tian et al. [19]. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the authors implemented a GIS methodology in analyzing\nthe distribution between\
    \ energy types with respect to their contribution in yield. Furthermore, their\n\
    study recorded numerical data collected on-site that assisted them to analyze\
    \ the spatial variation of\nenergy consumption. They produced several thematic\
    \ maps, which visualize several indices related to\nspatial correlation, clustering,\
    \ and association. The results categorized the energy types in signiﬁcance\nand\
    \ Moran’s I index proved to be the most productive tool for large scale spatial\
    \ correlation analysis.\n2.3. Data from Satellites\nRemote sensing has proved\
    \ to be game-changing for the agricultural sector, as it is considered\nto be\
    \ fundamental for the trending “precision agriculture” framework. In principle,\
    \ remote sensing\nestimates the properties of a plant through non-destructive\
    \ processes in a fast and accurate method.\nIt may include a wide range of applications\
    \ in agriculture, such as crop growth monitoring, crop yield,\nand quality estimation,\
    \ identiﬁcation of irrigation needs, as well as biotic and abiotic damage [20].\n\
    Zarco-Tejada et al. [21] studied the effects of hyper-spectral indices in agricultural\
    \ research and\nin particular in the natural conditions of vineyards. Their scope\
    \ of research concentrated to vine\nreﬂectance along with soil spectra extracted\
    \ from images collected at spatial resolution of 1 m and on\nSustainability 2019,\
    \ 11, 3278\n7 of 23\n8 spectral bands. In particular, they concentrated at the\
    \ calculation of narrow-band indices of pigment\ndensity. Furthermore, this study\
    \ investigated the optical properties of Vitis vinifera L. leaves by taking\n\
    into consideration its reﬂectance and transmittance properties. Additionally,\
    \ the researchers measured\nthe optical index calculation along with the destructive\
    \ determination of pigments on a database\nretrieved between 2002 and 2003. The\
    \ images were obtained from 103 study sites that include 24 ﬁelds\nand enabled\
    \ the use of scaling up on leaf-level sensitive remote sensing indices. The indices\
    \ assisted\nthe researchers to assess on the effectiveness of canopy-level information\
    \ retrieval methodology.\nIt is acknowledged that water is a major resource in\
    \ agriculture and is related to arid regions.\nRemote Sensing (RS) toolkits offer\
    \ region characterization on drought through speciﬁed indices\ndeveloped for remote\
    \ study. Rhee et al. [22] proposed a RS-based drought index that monitors arid\n\
    and humid regions using multi-sensor data. Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI)\
    \ combines several\nassets of RS methodology (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI), Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer Sensor (MODIS),\
    \ and precipitation (TRMM)) in order to collect relevant\ninformation for the\
    \ effect of waterlessness on annual basis. The SDCI was affected by the varied\
    \ spatial\nresolution from each of the indices and scaling was an approach to\
    \ segregate the drought effect among\narid and humid areas, while the dataset\
    \ will get enriched over time.\nZone scaling on thematic maps of wine grape terroirs\
    \ was the subject of study of Vaudour et al. [23].\nThey proposed a mapping methodology\
    \ of implementing bootstrapped regression trees on distinct\ncombinations of morphometric\
    \ data in conjunction with 20 meter SPOT satellite images. Furthermore,\nthe authors\
    \ managed to capture expert knowledge on grape harvest quality at various spots\
    \ in South\nAfrica on a regional scale. Their proof of concept methodology relied\
    \ on a limited number of easily\navailable spatial data at a medium spatial resolution;\
    \ the positive aspect was the fact that the latter\ncould be duplicated to any\
    \ other homogeneous viticultural terroirs.\nProductivity assessment analysis while\
    \ implementing hyper-spectral reﬂectance recognition in\nrelation to vines biophysical\
    \ properties was proposed by Serrano et al. [24]. Their work focused\non berry\
    \ yield growth and quality attributes prediction in rain-fed vineyards. The indices\
    \ implied\ndifferences among vineyards with relation to their vine canopy vigor\
    \ and water status, on a water\ndeﬁcit time scale. Furthermore, their results\
    \ indicated speciﬁc correlations among indices that are\nmore susceptible to water\
    \ sufﬁciency or deﬁciency on the scope of predicting berry quality attributes\n\
    in relation to aquatic reserves.\nBourgeon et al. [25] proposed methodology for\
    \ characterizing vine foliage with the use of\nmultispectral satellite sensors.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, they introduced a proximal imaging sensor that\noperates within\
    \ the visible and near-infrared (NI) spectral bands. The camera sensor was deployed\
    \ at\nthe ground level and produced absolute reﬂectance images comparable to NDVI\
    \ maps produced by\ncommercial satellite systems. The physiological assessment\
    \ of the vines was implemented through\nradiometric calibration of multispectral\
    \ imagery by post-image processing tools on the scope of\ntemporal monitoring\
    \ the evolution of vine foliage.\nTang et al. [26] proposed both a proximal and\
    \ a remote sensing method, utilizing two\ndifferent methods for assisting in decision\
    \ support and yield estimation from existing technologies.\nThey employed ground\
    \ video feed for green pixel, in conjunction to local thresholding and\nSelf-Organizing-Maps\
    \ from satellite imagery, in order to identify non-productive vines in the available\n\
    canopy on the block level. This semi-supervised version provided recognition capabilities\
    \ at the\nphenological stage as an automatic and low-cost monitoring application,\
    \ potentially deployed over\ndifferent times within the season.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ socio-economic, and physical effects on Mediterranean vineyards is the subject\n\
    of study for Vinatier and Gonzalez-Arnaiz [27]. The researchers employed multi-temporal\
    \ satellite\nimagery in order to comprehend and track the changes in land cover\
    \ that shape agricultural landscapes.\nFurthermore, the changes in land management\
    \ were composed in transition matrices that interpret\ngains, losses, and swaps\
    \ for each category. In addition to temporal changes, images with sufﬁcient\n\
    spatial resolution were used in order to detect subtle differences in land use/cover\
    \ on a speciﬁc scale.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n8 of 23\nTheir work underlines\
    \ the usefulness of satellite imagery in classifying alterations in yield distribution\n\
    and quality, in relation to external parameters that drive land management in\
    \ agricultural areas.\nYield quality and productivity can be assessed through\
    \ satellite and proximal sensing by\nestimating spectral vegetation indices (SVIs).\
    \ Anastasiou et al. [20] employed satellite and proximal\nsensing at the various\
    \ stages of table grape growth for three cultivation years in a row (i.e., between\n\
    2015–2017). Landsat 8 satellite imagery and proximal sensing techniques produced\
    \ calculations of\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index\n(GNDVI) that the SVIs were based upon. The indices\
    \ measure seasonal plant response - exploiting soil\nand plant spectra—and produce\
    \ the type of relationship between visible and near-infrared reﬂectance.\nTheir\
    \ results indicated higher accuracy of proximal sensing, providing higher correlations\
    \ and temporal\naccuracy during the earlier period of grape growth.\nThe importance\
    \ of water resources in the quality of vine production is highlighted by Loggenberg\n\
    et al. [28]. They introduce a machine-learning based remote sensing methodology\
    \ for the study of\nwater stress in Shiraz type vineyards. The results are based\
    \ on terrestrial hyper-spectral imaging\ncapturing the study areas, which were\
    \ located in Stellenbosch at the Western Cape of South Africa.\nThey employed\
    \ several remote sensing methodologies upon data acquisition and pre-processing\n\
    techniques combining on-site and satellite sampling. The remote sensing methodology\
    \ consists of\nspectral smoothing for multi-band images, classiﬁcation (implemented\
    \ with Random Forest (RF) and\nExtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting) techniques),\
    \ dimensional reduction, and accuracy assessment.\nThe researchers concluded that\
    \ remote sensing machine learning methodologies on hyperspectral data\ndemonstrated\
    \ that Random Forest (RF) classiﬁcation optimally corresponds to water stress\
    \ modelling\nin applications related to viticulture.\n2.4. Image Data from Drones\n\
    In data-driven agriculture, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, as they\
    \ are usually\nreferred to, are a valuable tool for making inferences about grape\
    \ composition from multispectral\nmeasurements. They can acquire high-resolution\
    \ aerial images, digital RGB (Red-Green-Blue),\nhyper-spectral imagery of vineyards,\
    \ as well as data of other modalities. When equipped with\nappropriate sensors,\
    \ UAVs can collect useful data related to leaf temperature, vine water status,\n\
    and canopy vigor. Depending on the need of the applications, equipped sensors\
    \ can gather thermal,\nvisible, hyperspectral, and/or multispectral images. For\
    \ example, hyperspectral sensors can gather\na broader range of wavelengths; a\
    \ thermal camera can gather image data to determine canopy variables\nsuch as\
    \ water stress.\nComba et al. [29] introduced the adoption of detection techniques\
    \ in modern precision agriculture\nfor quality production standards. The researchers\
    \ proposed an image processing algorithm for the\nautomatic detection of vine\
    \ rows from gray-scale aerial imagery. Near-infrared (NI) images acquired\nwith\
    \ a Tetracam ADC-lite camera (http://www.tetracam.com/Products-ADC_Lite.htm) that\
    \ was\ninstalled on a Mikrokopter Hexa-II drone (http://wiki.mikrokopter.de/en/HexaKopter).\
    \ This array\nhas a ﬁeld of view and is able to achieve a 0.056 m/pixel ground\
    \ resolution at a ﬂight altitude of 150 m.\nAdditionally, the effectiveness of\
    \ the proposed method has been demonstrated by reporting the results\nof the elaborations\
    \ applied to 4 sample vineyard images. The proposed method is able to process\
    \ the\noriginal acquired image as it is, without any intervention or feedback\
    \ from the user and requires a very\nlimited number of calibration parameters.\
    \ The results obtained from the processing of a set of sample\nimages demonstrate\
    \ the effectiveness of the proposed method, with a very limited error rate, even\
    \ in\nthe case of images with disturbances and different vine row orientations\
    \ in the same image.\nThe work of Matese et al. [30] describes the implementation\
    \ probabilities of multi-sensor\nUAVs with a variety of monitoring tasks. The\
    \ researchers assessed the intra-vineyard in terms\nof characterization of the\
    \ state of vines vigor using multispectral cameras, leaf temperature (thermal\n\
    camera), and a model methodology of missing plants analysis with a high spatial\
    \ resolution of RGB\nbands camera. The aforementioned apparatus was designed speciﬁcally\
    \ for precision viticulture in the\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n9 of 23\nscope\
    \ of rapid and multi-purpose environmental monitoring within the areas of interest.\
    \ The UAV\nprovided images with discriminative details in rows and inter-rows\
    \ of vines and as a result provided\npure pixels with solely the foliage. Their\
    \ usage in agricultural applications, in general, and in viticulture,\nin particular,\
    \ is enhanced by high ﬂexibility of use, low operating costs, and a very high\
    \ spatial\nresolution that they offer.\nDe Castro et al. [31] exploited the capabilities\
    \ of UAVs to produce image data that support 3D\nlandscape models. The aerial\
    \ vehicles ﬂew over 3 vineyards with a distinct gap between the vine\nrows at\
    \ a different growth rate. More speciﬁcally they chose to make the ﬂights in July\
    \ and September\nin order to depict the two distinct phases of the crop. With\
    \ their approach, they managed to gather\ninformation from 3 ﬁelds at two crop\
    \ stages, analyzing a wide range of situations and as a result to\nproduce robust\
    \ data. The UAVs were ﬂown at 30 m of altitude, taking images with spatial resolution\
    \ of\n1cm per pixel (i.e., ground image size: 37 × 28 m) in a rate of 1 s per\
    \ frame. Therefore, they succeeded\nto get a 93% forward lap and 60% of side lap\
    \ in order to create a 3D reconstruction of crops.\nMulti-temporal monitoring\
    \ of agricultural lands demands continuous characterization of\nvegetation on\
    \ distinct dates. Pádua et al. [32] proposed a monitoring platform that uses multi-temporal\n\
    data related to precision viticulture (PV) that can be used to monitor the size,\
    \ shape, and vigour of\ngrapevines canopies. Their work aims to vegetation characterization\
    \ through multi-temporal analysis\nusing accessible and low cost UAVs for the\
    \ acquisition of very-high resolution imagery, up to ground\nsample distance (GSD)\
    \ and accompanied sensor nodes. Thereafter, the gathered data were analyzed\n\
    automatically with consideration of the natural, topographic, and morphological\
    \ variables of the area\nof interest. Their method produced RGB orthophoto mosaics\
    \ of the vineyards in whole, multi-temporal\nﬁeld analysis, and, ﬁnally, a crop-related\
    \ and non-invasive data acquisition method for farmers.\nAll in all, high-resolution\
    \ aerial images from drones can be used to determine the spatial\ndistribution\
    \ of a variety of canopy variables within a vineyard block and between different\
    \ vineyard\nblocks. In this way, UAVs can be used to measure the spatial distribution\
    \ of vigor, water stress, nutrient\nstatus, disease, yield components, and berry\
    \ composition. Rationale for employing drones in precision\nviticulture practices\
    \ are the higher ﬂexibility of use, lower operational costs compared to the usage\n\
    of conventional aircraft, and invariability to cloud cover. However, utilization\
    \ of UAVs in precision\nviticulture is a relatively new area of research, not\
    \ extensively tested and the major challenges to be\nconsidered are the massive\
    \ amount of collected data, the time required for post processing of collected\n\
    data, and the need for feature engineering in order to derive useful vegetation\
    \ indices that are speciﬁc\nto variables of interest.\n3. Machine Learning (ML)\
    \ Methodologies for Agricultural Data\nDuring the last years we have witnessed\
    \ a plethora of technological breakthroughs in domains\nsuch as computer vision\
    \ and machine translation, which have led to the establishment of Machine\nLearning\
    \ (ML) as one of the core tenets of the current technological landscape. The aforementioned\n\
    successes can mainly be attributed to the utilization of large and complex Deep\
    \ Neural Network (DNN)\narchitectures, better acknowledged as “deep learning.”\n\
    Moreover, the evolution and transformations in the smart agriculture ﬁeld over\
    \ the recent years\nresult nowadays in the mass production of huge amounts of\
    \ data, information, and content from many\ndifferent sources, such as IoT devices\
    \ and sensors, environmentalists, agronomists, winemakers, or\nplain farmers and\
    \ interested stakeholders. Thus, deep learning along with other more “conventional”\n\
    machine learning methodologies, can play a pivotal role towards addressing numerous\
    \ research\nproblems within the agricultural domain, mainly through the utilization\
    \ of the large amount of\navailable digitized agricultural information.\nIn the\
    \ following, Section 3.1 presents research works related to exploiting continuous\
    \ data\n(e.g., data from sensors such as temperature, soil moisture, etc.) for\
    \ the purpose of creating predictive\nMachine Learning models capable to provide\
    \ various forecasts, whereas Section 3.2 describes the\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 3278\n10 of 23\nusage of image-based information mostly by deep learning models,\
    \ which are capable of classifying\nplant species, detect deceases, and ﬁnally,\
    \ perform spatial-aware object classiﬁcation.\n3.1. ML-Based Forecasting on Numerical\
    \ Data\nOne of the worth-noting works in the ﬁeld is the one by Radhika and M.\
    \ Shashi [33],\nwhere they exploit Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the task\
    \ of predicting the maximum\ndaily temperature. They use a Multi-Layer Perceptron\
    \ (MLP) as a baseline, trained through\nback-propagation. To accomplish the aforementioned\
    \ prediction task, they rely on weather data\nprovided by the University of Cambridge\
    \ for the time period of 2003–2007. Through their experimental\nﬁndings, the authors\
    \ showcase that the SVM-based approach is able to achieve signiﬁcant results,\n\
    thus showcasing its suitability for this particular prediction problem.\nSimilarly,\
    \ Gill et al. [34] develop a SVM regression model in order to predict the moisture\
    \ of soil.\nIn particular, the authors utilize both meteorological and soil moisture\
    \ data, from 11 weather stations\nfrom the Oklahoma region in the United States\
    \ of America for training and testing their prediction\nmodel. Finally, by comparing\
    \ their proposed model against an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN),\nthey showcase\
    \ its efﬁciency.\nMohammadi et al. [35] develop a predictive model for the task\
    \ of inferring the dew point\ntemperature, i.e., the temperature at which water\
    \ vapor in the air condenses into liquid, since by\npredicting this, it is also\
    \ possible to determine whether it will rain or snow at a particular date.\nTo\
    \ achieve that, the authors exploit Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), i.e., feed-forward\
    \ neural\nnetworks, in which the weights of the nodes within a hidden layer do\
    \ not require any kind of tuning.\nThrough an experimental evaluation of their\
    \ model against conventional machine learning models\n(e.g., SVMs and ANNs), using\
    \ as a training dataset measurements from two meteorological stations in\nIran,\
    \ the authors were able to show that ELM can be applied for this problem with\
    \ promising results.\nSalcedo-Sanz et al. [36] propose a Machine Learning model\
    \ for long-term air temperature\nprediction, a task that is useful for a plethora\
    \ of domains, such as agriculture. They use the publicly\navailable monthly mean\
    \ temperature dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology\n(BOM),\
    \ from urban and regional areas in Australia. They develop and evaluate two distinct\
    \ methods,\ni.e., a SVM regressor and an ANN, and showcase that the former is\
    \ able to outperform the latter,\nregarding the air temperature prediction task.\n\
    Abbot and Marohasy [37] exploit Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in order to predict\
    \ rainfall,\nfor the region of Queensland in Australia. More speciﬁcally, the\
    \ authors apply the aforementioned\ncategory of Machine Learning models for the\
    \ purpose of providing a medium-term rainfall\nforecast that outperforms conventional\
    \ statistical models typically exploited for this task. Similarly,\nChithra et\
    \ al. [38] utilise ANNs, for detecting the impact of climate change on the monthly\
    \ mean\nmaximum and minimum temperature in the Chaliyar river basin located in\
    \ India.\nOnal et al. [39] proposed an extended IoT Framework based on data integration,\
    \ retrieval,\nprocessing, and learning layers trough a weather data clustering\
    \ analysis methodology. Their learning\nmodel implemented unsupervised clustering\
    \ as a method of big data utilization originating from\n8000 weather stations\
    \ from North America. Air temperature, wind-speed, relative humidity, visibility,\n\
    and pressure data were analyzed by a traditional k-means clustering algorithm\
    \ under the scope of the\nstations’ geographical alignment.\nSehgal et al. [40]\
    \ developed ”ViSeed”, a Machine Learning and visualization framework\nfor weather\
    \ and yield prediction, respectively. In particular, the authors train and evaluate\n\
    a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classiﬁer on the Syngenta 2016 crop data challenge,\n\
    whereas Song et al. [41] utilize a Deep Belief Network (DBN), in order to predict\
    \ the soil moisture\ncontent in a corn ﬁeld. By training and evaluating their\
    \ proposed model on soil data collected from the\nZhangye oasis, in Northwest\
    \ China, and bench-marking against a multi-layer perceptron, the authors\nwere\
    \ able to showcase its effectiveness for the aforementioned task.\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n11 of 23\nFinally, Priya et al. [42] developed an integrated\
    \ system for precision agriculture implementing\nbig data analytics, IoT, and\
    \ Machine Learning methodologies. Their crop recommendation system\nuses Naïve\
    \ Bayes to indicate if the conditions are optimal for sowing, plant growth, and\
    \ harvesting of\na plant, in addition to yield prediction and pesticide recommendation.\
    \ Furthermore, the researchers\nproduced a scalable model based on data collected\
    \ from various sources, such as satellite images,\nsensor recorded ﬁeld data,\
    \ irrigation related reports, crop data, and weather data in India.\nThe interested\

    In the framework of scene classiﬁcation, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard [43] apply\
    \ a deep neural\nnetwork for the task of fruit counting.\nIn particular, the authors\
    \ present two different neural\narchitectures, i.e., a novel convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN) and a modiﬁed version of the\nwell-known Inception-ResNet network.\
    \ In order to train the presented deep neural architectures,\nauthors rely on\
    \ a synthetic dataset, whereas, in order to validate their performance, they use\
    \ real\nimages collected from Google Images. Through their experimental approach\
    \ authors showcase the\nefﬁciency of their proposed neural architecture against\
    \ various baselines.\nSimilarly, Sa et al. [44] present DeepFruit, a neural network\
    \ for fruit detection. More speciﬁcally,\nthe authors adopt the Faster Region-based\
    \ CNN architecture and through transfer learning train\nit to be able to successfully\
    \ recognize sweet peppers contained in an image. Yalcin [45] developed\nDeep-Pheno,\
    \ a CNN for the task of recognizing and classifying the phenological stages of\
    \ plants,\ni.e., its life cycle. The author uses images depicting plants such\
    \ as cotton, wheet, and pepper from\ncameras found on various agro-stations in\
    \ Turkey for training and testing the model. The presented\nneural architecture\
    \ was able to outperform various conventional machine learning algorithms in the\n\
    aforementioned classiﬁcation task.\nLee et al. [46] used CNNs in order to extract\
    \ features from images in a completely unsupervised\nway, so as to train classiﬁers\
    \ able to identify 44 different plant species. Moreover, the authors try to\n\
    understand the feature representation of the model, so as to shed some light on\
    \ its inner decision\nmechanisms. Authors train and test the CNN on a leaf dataset\
    \ collected from the Kew Royal Botanic\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n12 of 23\n\
    Gardens in England. Finally, in order to evaluate the usefulness of the features\
    \ that the network learns,\nthey use them as input to a NN and SVM classiﬁers,\
    \ and thus are able to achieve beyond state-of-the-art\nresults. In a similar\
    \ approach, Dyrmann et al. [47] propose a CNN architecture for classifying images\
    \ of\nseedings during the early growth stage of a plant. More speciﬁcally, the\
    \ authors train a classiﬁer that is\nable to predict, using vertically photographed\
    \ images of seedings, 22 different plant species, achieving\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ results by training the network on 10,413 images collected from six different\
    \ datasets.\nFurthermore, Bargoti and Underwood [48] present an image-based fruit\
    \ detection model using\nthe Faster R-CNN neural architecture for mangoes, almonds,\
    \ and apples, achieving very good results.\nIn order to train the model, the authors\
    \ use images captured from orchards in the regions of Victoria\nand Queensland\
    \ in Australia. They present ablation studies so as to showcase the inner functionality\n\
    of the neural model, as well as which factors within an image play an important\
    \ role for the object\ndetection task. Mohanty et al. [49] apply convolutional\
    \ neural networks for automatically detecting\nand diagnosing plant diseases through\
    \ images. To achieve that, the authors utilize a public dataset\ncontaining 54,306\
    \ images of both diseased and healthy plant leaves, and train two neural architectures,\n\
    i.e., AlexNet and GoogLeNet, for classifying crop species and diseases status,\
    \ achieving a 99% accuracy.\nSimilarly, Sladojevic et al. [50] use a convolutional\
    \ deep learning model in order to automatically\nclassify and detect plant diseases\
    \ from images containing leafs. The proposed model was able to detect\nleaf presence\
    \ and distinguish between healthy leaves and 13 different diseases, which can\
    \ be visually\ndiagnosed. Moreover, the authors created a new dataset for training\
    \ and testing Machine Learning\nmodels for this particular task, containing more\
    \ than 3000 images gathered from the Internet and then\nextend it to more than\
    \ 30,000 using various data augmentation techniques. Mortensen et al. [51] utilize\n\
    a deep neural network to perform semantic segmentation for mixed crops. In particular,\
    \ the authors\nwere able to use a convolutional neural architecture (i.e., VGG16)\
    \ and through transfer learning\n(i.e., ﬁne-tuning the network instead of training\
    \ it from scratch) have it successfully estimate both\nthe individual components,\
    \ as well as the total biomass of a crop using an image dataset from a plot\n\
    experiment at Foulum Research Center in Denmark.\nRußwurm and Körner [52] perform\
    \ multi-temporal classiﬁcation upon a time-series for the\nclassiﬁcation of crops\
    \ for two seasons achieving state-of-the-art results, and thus showcasing the\n\
    efﬁcacy of deep learning methodologies for this particular domain. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ to perform\nthe aforementioned task, the authors applied an encoder-decoder\
    \ neural architecture on an Earth\nobservation (EO) sensors time-series dataset\
    \ from the region of Munich, Germany. Finally, they also\nprovide a visualization\
    \ of the neural network’s activations, so as to facilitate a better understanding\n\
    of its inner decision-making mechanisms. Pound et al. [53] exploit neural networks,\
    \ to perform\nimage-based plant phenotyping, i.e., describe features such as its\
    \ anatomical, ontogenetical,\nphysiological, and biochemical properties. In particular,\
    \ the authors train two different CNN-based\nneural networks to perform root and\
    \ shoot detection for wheat varieties, using a different dataset for\neach task,\
    \ respectively. Using this experimental approach they were able to achieve state-of-the-art\n\
    results (i.e., >97% accuracy) for root and shoot feature identiﬁcation and localization.\n\
    Namin et al. [54] present a neural architecture consisting of a CNN and Long-Short\
    \ Term\nNetwork (LSTN) for the task of plant classiﬁcation. In particular, the\
    \ authors utilize the CNN\nfor the unsupervised generation of features, and the\
    \ LSTN to investigate the growth of plants.\nBy applying their presented deep\
    \ learning framework on an image-based time-series dataset depicting\n4 different\
    \ categories of Arabidopsis thaliana plant, they were able to showcase that deep\
    \ learning\nnetworks can generate more useful features than the traditional hand-crafted\
    \ image analysis features,\nas well as achieve better results than conventional\
    \ Machine Learning methodologies. Kussul et al. [55]\nperform Land Cover and Crop\
    \ Types classiﬁcation using a dataset consisting of remote sensing\ndata. To effectively\
    \ tackle this particular problem, they use a multilevel deep learning approach,\n\
    i.e., both supervised and unsupervised learning through neural networks for segmenting\
    \ and\nclassifying a multi-source satellite image dataset. Their proposed neural\
    \ architecture was able to\noutperform traditional Machine Learning techniques\
    \ such as random forests.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n13 of 23\nRiegler-Nurscher\
    \ et al. [56] studied the sustainable cultivation of arable lands by introducing\n\
    a novel generic image analysis method for the estimation of soil cover. They implemented\
    \ a machine\nlearning methodology for distinguishing between various types of\
    \ soil cover through training\na manageable amount of classiﬁcation samples. Their\
    \ method deployed entangled random forests\non a wide training data set of soil\
    \ images obtained by high resolution cameras.\nFurthermore,\nthe pixel-wise method\
    \ produced accurate classiﬁcation of living plant material, building the basis\
    \ for\nfurther development of soil cover estimation in agriculture.\nLastly, Hall\
    \ et al. [57] investigate whether traditional hand-crafted image features can\
    \ outperform\nthose generated in an unsupervised way through deep neural networks\
    \ for the task of leaf classiﬁcation.\nBy training a deep convolutional neural\
    \ network on the Flavia dataset, the authors were able to\nshowcase that features\
    \ generated by the network are more useful than hand-crafting image features,\n\
    although they stress that combining both approaches leads to optimized state-of-the-art\
    \ results.\nTable 2 provides a brief comparative overview of the above discussed\

    \ Classiﬁcation\nModern imagery is possessed by hierarchies of features that are\
    \ optimally described through\nconvolutional networks. The goal of producing suitable\
    \ size of outputs while at the same time\nkeeping inference and learning at efﬁcient\
    \ levels is implemented by building fully convolutional\nstructures that manage\
    \ inputs of arbitrary size. Furthermore, deep machine learning is a powerful\n\
    and robust tool to analyzing and predicting the statistical, geographical, and\
    \ multispectral optical big\ndata. It provides predictions and simulations of\
    \ the landscape expanding and evolution (geographical\nbig data) in more reasonable\
    \ and robust method. In this framework, Long et al. [58] presented\nthe basis\
    \ of segmenting semantic data through convolutional networks. More speciﬁcally\
    \ they\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n14 of 23\nnoted that segmentation bridges\
    \ the gap between semantics and location, based on the distinction\nof global\
    \ (i.e., ”what?”) and local (i.e., ”where?”) information. Based on deep feature\
    \ hierarchies\nthe researchers were able to encode location and semantics in a\
    \ nonlinear local-to-global pyramid.\nThey managed to deﬁne a “skip architecture”\
    \ to take advantage of a spectrum of features that\ncombine deep, coarse, semantic\
    \ information, and shallow, ﬁne, appearance information. Furthermore,\nthey stated\
    \ that fully convolutional networks are a rich class of models, which are able\
    \ to extent\ntheir classiﬁcation nets to segmentation. Additionally, Semantic\
    \ Segmentation allows to improve the\narchitecture with multi-resolution layer\
    \ combinations that dramatically improve the state-of-the-art,\nwhile simultaneously\
    \ simplifying and speeding up learning and inference tasks.\nThe importance of\
    \ aerial survey is underlined by the existing image collection and interpretation\n\
    tools.\nRecent rapid progress on these domains incur due to accessibility and\
    \ advancements in\ntechnology. However, imagery has little meaning by itself,\
    \ unless it is processed and meaningful\ninformation is derived from it. Therefore,\
    \ image classification comes as a way to address the problem of\nalgorithm generalization\
    \ through deep learning on the purposes of object recognition and detection,\n\
    scene parsing, and classification. Categorizing each image pixel to a semantic\
    \ class is typically called\n”Image Segmentation” and aims at understanding an\
    \ image at the pixel level, although images of\na fixed size are required to achieve\
    \ optimized classification, dense prediction of images of any size,\nand significantly\
    \ increased speed in the process. Still, the concept of smart agriculture convicts\
    \ the\nautomation of such tasks, especially where the optical sensors play an\
    \ important role. Guijarro et al. [59]\ndeveloped an image processing algorithm\
    \ through new automatic approach for segmenting main image\ntextures. Additionally,\
    \ they also managed to refine the identification of sub-textures inside the main\n\
    ones. They implemented a three step approach of automatic image segmentation that\
    \ proved its\neffectiveness under different illumination conditions in outdoor\
    \ environments.\nThe re-establishment of bee colonies through color satellite\
    \ image segmentation was the subject\nof study of Sammouda et al. [60]. They introduced\
    \ a pixel clustering methodology by introducing\na Hopﬁeld Neural Network (HNN)\
    \ to consider monitoring aspects such as environmental conditions,\npoor resolution,\
    \ and poor illumination. The algorithm was implemented successively with two,\n\
    three, four, ﬁve, and six clusters, as well as with data from RGB channels, taking\
    \ into consideration\naspects such as population density, ecological distribution,\
    \ and ﬂowering phenology. Furthermore,\nsupervised multispectral land-use classiﬁcation\
    \ may be implemented through multi-view deep\nlearning methodology; Luus et al.\
    \ [61] designed a deep CNN (DCNN) for a well-known dataset\n(UC Merced Land Use\
    \ dataset: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html) and used\n\
    as a benchmark for several applications. Their end-to-end learning system was\
    \ capable of complex\nland-use classiﬁcation of high-resolution multispectral\
    \ aerial imagery. Furthermore, it was shown that\nmulti-scale views can be used\
    \ to train a single network and increase classiﬁcation accuracy compared\nto using\
    \ single-view samples.\nHigh-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) provides pixel size\
    \ classiﬁcation of individual entities in\ndetail. Längkvist et al. [62] proposed\
    \ a method for classifying objects from multispectral orthoimagery\nand digital\
    \ surface models (DSMs). The researchers investigated the use of convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for per-pixel classiﬁcation on satellite imagery with\
    \ very high resolution (VHR)\ncharacteristics. They managed to categorize large\
    \ landscapes into 5 classes (vegetation, ground, road,\nbuilding, and water) and\
    \ discovered that at the context size of about 24 pixels they can achieve\nlow\
    \ training and testing simulation time, and concurrently high and stable classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy.\nAdditionally, the researchers deployed multiple CNNs in parallel\
    \ with varying context areas in order\nto provide a stable and accurate classiﬁcation\
    \ result.\nContinuing, modelling techniques of entities of the agricultural terrain\
    \ based on remote detection\nmay be produced through suitable algorithms’ development.\
    \ Comba et al. [29] proposed a categorizing\nmethod for parallel and equidistant\
    \ vine rows in order to eliminate spatial periodicity during the image\nelaboration\
    \ process. More speciﬁcally, the proposed algorithm is able to remove disturbance\
    \ image\nelements (e.g., roads, shadows) and minimize cloud obstruction. Their\
    \ multi-parameter technique was\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n15 of 23\nimplemented\
    \ autonomously, without user intervention, while allowing automatic path computation\n\
    in the corridors between vineyards. Finally the computational effort is affordable\
    \ and the results can\nbe obtained in a few minutes of elaboration for complex\
    \ images.\nThe use of crowd-sourcing geo-tagged ﬁeld photos in agricultural monitoring\
    \ applications forms\nanother interesting approach and was investigated by Xu\
    \ et al. [63]. They developed a land cover type\nrecognition model for ﬁeld photos\
    \ based on deep learning techniques. More speciﬁcally they combined\na pre-trained\
    \ convolutional neural network (CNN), as the image feature extractor, and a multinomial\n\
    logistic regression model, as the feature classiﬁer. Their model was able to describe\
    \ its prediction\nconﬁdence and can enable users to distinguish reliable and unreliable\
    \ predictions. The researchers were\nalso able to provide a new research direction\
    \ in citizen science by proving the possibility that Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence is\
    \ capable of helping with land cover classiﬁcation and evaluating the model’s\
    \ performance.\nThe topic of land classiﬁcation is strongly related to agricultural\
    \ applications through its\nmapping changes and transformation on the landscape.\
    \ Wurm et al. [64] investigated the application\nof Fully Convolutional Networks\
    \ (FCNs) in map entities categorization from various satellite\nimages. They deployed\
    \ high resolution optical imagery form Quickbird (https://bit.ly/2Fvpq4u),\nin\
    \ conjunction with Sentinel-2 (https://bit.ly/2UVFO3C) and TerraSAR-X (https://bit.ly/2WlZHBb)\n\
    data, by using them in FCNs without fully connected the existing layers popularized\
    \ by CNN\narchitectures. Furthermore, they explored the capabilities of this process\
    \ of ”transfer learning” to later\nadopt a pre-trained CNN from VHR optical Quickbird\
    \ imagery. The images were then applied to\ndatasets with larger mapping areas\
    \ but lower geometric resolution such as Sentinel-2. Additionally,\nthey assessed\
    \ the capabilities of transfer learning from optical imagery to existing active\
    \ SAR imagery\nfrom TerraSAR-X. Their results produced extremely promising segmentation\
    \ outcomes that can be used\nas a proof-of-concept in transfer learning and fully\
    \ convolutional networks for landscape mapping in\nsatellite imagery.\nLastly,\
    \ following the previous notation we introduce Table 3, which provides the comparative\n\
    overview of the above-mentioned research efforts in the same four-column tabular\
    \ manner. It should\nalso be clear at this point that the above research works\
    \ present image processing techniques that\ncan be used to enhance agricultural\
    \ practices, by improving accuracy and consistency of processes,\nwhile at the\
    \ same time reducing farmers’ manual monitoring procedures. These techniques are\
    \ quite\nimportant, since they offer ﬂexibility and effectively substitutes the\

    The adoption of smart technology (e.g., sensors) within the domain of agriculture\
    \ has lead to\nan ever-increasing amount of digital information that can be utilized\
    \ for various knowledge extraction\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n16 of 23\n\
    tasks through visualization platforms and predictive models. Moreover, the datasets\
    \ created from the\naforementioned smart devices may be further enriched through\
    \ manual and/or automated annotation\ntechniques in order to improve their usefulness.\
    \ Following Section 4.1 describes how the domain\nof knowledge base creation may\
    \ beneﬁt agriculture, whereas Section 4.2 depicts how leveraging\nvarious data\
    \ visualization techniques can contribute towards a better understanding towards\
    \ the\napplicability of agricultural data. Finally, Section 4.3 showcases the\
    \ applicability of crowd-sourcing for\nthe domain of agriculture, stressing various\
    \ use-cases that can potentially enhance the efﬁciency of\nvarious agriculture-related\
    \ tasks.\n4.1. Knowledge Base Creation Characteristics\nAs the world becomes full\
    \ of sensor networks producing information, agriculture enters the ﬁelds\nof data\
    \ processing, storage, and retrieval at a very fast pace. Through various sources\
    \ of information\nderiving from a wide data spectrum (e.g., geo-information, soil\
    \ measurements, weather forecast,\nchemical analyses, to mention just a few data\
    \ streams), the agriculture industry is in a position to grow\nan extremely rich\
    \ system of integrated IoT data to power more informed decisions. The main challenge\n\
    lies in the high heterogeneity of data types in the agricultural sector; agriculture\
    \ makes use of various\ndifferent data (e.g., research, meteorological, soil,\
    \ ﬁnancial/economic, statistical, satellite/remote\nsensing, administrative, germplasm,\
    \ crop experiments, and ﬁeld trials, to name a few) and for each\ndata type there\
    \ are numerous standards used and these standards are not always linked between\
    \ each\nother or at least with the most prominent one of the sector. Thus, all\
    \ collected data that accompany\nan agricultural object (i.e., crops, seeds, etc.)\
    \ are typically stored in metadata records.\nMetadata records are critical to\
    \ the documentation and maintenance of interrelationships between\ninformation\
    \ resources and are being used to ﬁnd, gather, and maintain resources over long\
    \ periods\nof time, like viticulture historical data. The consistent application\
    \ of a descriptive metadata standard\nimproves the user’s search experience and\
    \ makes information retrieval within a single collection\nor across multiple datasets\
    \ more reliable. Descriptive, administrative, technical, and preservation\nmetadata\
    \ contribute to the management of information resources and help to ensure their\
    \ intellectual\nintegrity both now and in the future. In parallel with other domains,\
    \ many researchers in the digital\nagricultural community recognized the need\
    \ to lower the barriers for the management and aggregation\nof digital resources,\
    \ by implementing some measure of interoperability among metadata standards\n\
    and then with proprietary data structures. As a result, there is a wide range\
    \ of proposed solutions,\nincluding crosswalks, translation algorithms, metadata\
    \ registries, and specialized data dictionaries.\nTypically, a crosswalk provides\
    \ mapping of metadata elements from one metadata schema to\nanother and is considered\
    \ one of the most robust and ﬂexible solution. The prerequisite to a meaningful\n\
    mapping requires a clear and precise deﬁnition of the elements in each schema.\
    \ The primary difﬁculty\nis to identify the common elements in different metadata\
    \ schemas and put this information to use in\nsystems that resolve differences\
    \ between incompatible records. Crosswalks are typically presented\nas tables\
    \ of equivalent elements in two schemas and, even though the equivalences may\
    \ be inexact,\nthey represent an expert’s judgment that the conceptual differences\
    \ are immaterial to the successful\noperation of a software process that involves\
    \ records encoded in the two models. A crosswalk supports\nthe ability of a retrieval\
    \ mechanism to query ﬁelds with the same or similar content in different data\n\
    sources. In other words, it supports the well-known and much desired - in the\
    \ digital world - notion of\n”semantic interoperability”.\nCrosswalks are not\
    \ only important for supporting the demand for single point of access or\ncross-domain\
    \ searching; they are also instrumental for converting data from one format to\
    \ another.\nHowever, aggregating metadata records from different repositories\
    \ may create confusing display\nresults, especially if some of the metadata were\
    \ automatically generated or created by institutions\nor individuals that did\
    \ not follow best practices or standard thesauri and controlled vocabularies.\n\
    Still, mapping metadata elements from different schemas is only one level of cross\
    \ walking. Another\nlevel of semantic interoperability addresses datatype registration\
    \ and formatting of the values that\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n17 of 23\n\
    populate the metadata elements, e.g., rules for recording personal names or encoding\
    \ standards for\ndates, and the alignment between local authority ﬁles and adopted\
    \ terminologies, but these topics\nexceed the scope of the current survey work.\n\
    4.2. Data Visualization\nTaking above discussion a step further, the scope of\
    \ developing conceptual understanding through\ndata on agriculture is implemented\
    \ with the assistance of visual representations of natural processes.\nGraphical\
    \ representation, computer animation, and spatial overlay of agricultural data\
    \ are often used\nin visualizing natural phenomena, as a derivative of data analysis\
    \ and ML. Furthermore, scientiﬁc\nillustrations provide guidance on constructing\
    \ visual models for knowledge systems and connection\nfor visual modeling of the\
    \ corresponding ﬁndings. Scientiﬁc papers facilitate the important concepts,\n\
    schemata, processes, and rules that enhance learning through paradigms. Each ﬁgure\
    \ or diagram\nposses the particular element and processing step that will guide\
    \ researchers to form the appropriate\nresearch concept. Additionally, dynamic\
    \ visualizations offer comparisons that investigate the effect\nof visualization\
    \ components on the acquisition of environmental and spatial factors of agricultural\n\
    research. On the aspect of image processing and analysis, visualization techniques\
    \ are used to monitor\nand manage images that reduce transition complexities and\
    \ raising future potentials for the research.\nThe goal of data visualization\
    \ is to bridge the gap between researcher and data concepts on\nthe basis of their\
    \ underlying physical laws and properties. Thereafter, the presentation of massive\n\
    amounts of data as ﬁgures, allow the researcher to trim ineffectual information,\
    \ focus on the necessary,\nand comprehend the semantics of data. In this framework,\
    \ Bajaj [65] categorized the aspects of dynamic\nrepresentation of data in three\
    \ categories, namely computation, display and querying, which address the\nparameters\
    \ of every visualization environment. It is remarkable that visualization techniques\
    \ are not\nonly based on data types, but also on the processing operators that\
    \ are inherent in each visualization\ntechnique [66]. The techniques could be\
    \ described a visualization data pipeline that distinguishes\nthem into four data\
    \ stages: Value, analytical abstraction, visualization abstraction, and view.\
    \ These stages\ndescribe the states of data and their according processing operations.\n\
    The familiarity of information entities in relation to their real world representation\
    \ is crucial\nfor human perception.\nThe distinction between visualization were\
    \ “science visualization” and\n“information visualization” and is implemented\
    \ through the development of “visual analytics”.\nInformation visualizatio as\
    \ a branch of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) utilizes graphics to assist\nresearchers\
    \ in grasping and interpreting data on the purpose of developing form mental models\
    \ of data.\nAccordingly, numerical entities can reveal speciﬁc features and patterns\
    \ of the obtained information.\nFurthermore, the deployed toolset aims on improving\
    \ ”the clarity and aesthetic appeal of the displayed\ninformation and allows a\
    \ person to understand large amount of data and interact with it” [67].\nThe advent\
    \ of Big Data and ML guides data research towards shaping the goal of visual\n\
    representation on the scope of identifying hidden patterns or extremities in data,\
    \ increasing query\nﬂexibility and specialization, comparing various units in\
    \ order to obtain relative difference in\nquantities and enabling on-the-ﬂy human\
    \ interaction. New possibilities of visualization distinguish\nits techniques\
    \ by three factors, namely: Data type, process, and interoperability. It’s worth\
    \ noting that\nhuman perceptional capabilities are not sufﬁcient to embrace data\
    \ in large amounts, thus each method\ncan support varied data types, various optical\
    \ tools, and varied methods for interaction. In particular,\nagricultural space,\
    \ as a scientiﬁc ﬁeld that employs interdisciplinary research methods, utilizes\n\
    spatio-temporal transitions of land characteristics in conjunction with their\
    \ physical parameters.\nThe various facets of digital representation are based\
    \ on important aspects of each dataset on\nthe distinctions between data and phenomena.\
    \ Supplementary to that, agricultural research is\nbased on ﬁeld-collected data\
    \ that require high-level abstract models of data processing [68].\nThe data-ﬂow-driven\
    \ model is overlaid on cartographic representation of the areas of interest, utilizing\n\
    static and dynamic maps. Furthermore, such a system is optimally supported by\
    \ a client-server\narchitecture, in order sustain scalability for handling data-intensive\
    \ agriculture applications. Quite on\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n18 of 23\n\
    the contrary, numerically based analytics produce outputs that are displayed in\
    \ the form of queries,\nreports, charts, and diagrams. Those static numerical\
    \ conceptions can in the typical case be utilized\nstandalone, or superimposed\
    \ on a dynamic visualization platform.\n4.3. Crowd-Wisdom Exploitation\nDuring\
    \ the past decade, the wisdom of the crowd, or, in other words, the so-called\
    \ crowd-sourcing\nestablished itself as a dominant platform for exploiting the\
    \ skills and knowledge of online Internet\nusers. In particular, crowd-sourcing\
    \ can be perceived as outsourcing the task of data collection and/or\ndata annotation\
    \ to a group of non-professionals. The contributors to a crowd-sourcing platform\
    \ may\nreceive monetary compensation, or provide their services free of charge,\
    \ having in mind the collective\ngood. In the agriculture case crowd-sourcing\
    \ may be used in order to increase the efﬁciency of\na multitude of tasks within\
    \ the aforementioned domain. For example, sensors can be used in a number\nof\
    \ contexts for agriculture. By developing a platform that stores this type of\
    \ information, users will be\nable to submit data stemming from their own sensor-based\
    \ projects, something that can lead to the\naggregation of information regarding\
    \ different plant and/or crop species, and geography. Moreover,\nthe task of identifying\
    \ the species that a plant belongs to, may be enhanced through crowd-sourcing.\n\
    In particular, a potential contributor can improve the performance of a Machine\
    \ Learning classiﬁer\nby providing hand-annotated images along with the correct\
    \ labels, as well as various metadata that\ncan be utilized as features by the\
    \ predictive model. Finally, weather information is pivotal for farmers.\nA number\
    \ of mobile applications, use forecast information and measurements both from\
    \ ofﬁcial\nweather stations, along with data provided by amateur stations, respectively.\n\
    However, in order for the aforementioned applications to reach their full potential,\
    \ a number of\ninitiatives and standards must be enforced in the future within\
    \ crowd-sourcing platforms, so as to\nensure open participation, implement data\
    \ quality policies, along with privacy and security issues\nwith respect to storing\
    \ and utilizing the crowd-sourced information. In addition, care should be\ntaken\
    \ about the identities of the contributors, whereas easy-to-use interfaces have\
    \ to be provided,\ndue to the fact that the Information Communication Technology\
    \ (ICT) skills of the contributors may\nsigniﬁcantly vary in the process. One\
    \ may identify different criteria for the crowd-sourcing initiative\nto be appealing\
    \ and sustainable in a mass scale in the ﬁeld. Among others, good participatory\n\
    user interfaces, service and information salience provided to farmers, as well\
    \ as the provision of\nreliable services are considered absolutely necessary for\
    \ the advance of this initiative. In addition,\ncare should be taken about the\
    \ credibility of the provided information to the farmers or the agricultural\n\
    stakeholders, together with appropriate data quality policies, yet to be deﬁned\
    \ at least at the European\nlevel. As a ﬁnal thought, sustainability is quite\
    \ dependent on both the contextual information feedback\nfrom a farmer’s perspective\
    \ and the community’s to which the farmer may or may not belong to.\n5. Discussion\
    \ and Conclusions\nIn this smart agriculture survey paper we attempted to brieﬂy\
    \ report on the basic steps and\nmethods of indicative solutions that span across\
    \ different disciplines and research areas, and as a result\ncover quite diverse\
    \ research directions. From the above analysis and presentation it should have\n\
    been obvious by now that most presented methodologies and scenarios are based\
    \ on both traditional,\nwell-established computer science algorithms and techniques,\
    \ that are currently being adapted to\nwork on the newly acquired agricultural\
    \ data, as well as innovative, new aspects, enabled by modern\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as drones and satellites, whose usage and exploitation were not available until\
    \ the\nvery recent years. Thus, the overall conclusion drawn may be summarized\
    \ in the following quotation:\nWhen dealing with intelligent agricultural information\
    \ and data, computing applications and systems,\nresearchers should in principle\
    \ initially target more ﬂexible and rather generic approaches and then\ntry to\
    \ identify additional but inherent sources of meaningful information to boost\
    \ and enhance their\nﬁndings in a qualitative manner. Since smart agriculture\
    \ is now becoming widely accepted to have\nmany forms and depictions, the era\
    \ of extremely focused and domain-speciﬁc applications and systems\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n19 of 23\nis considered to be quite over. By integrating the\
    \ herein brieﬂy presented works and by providing\na short discussion and interpretation\
    \ for each identiﬁed group, we deem and, at the same time,\nanticipate that the\
    \ herein instigated classiﬁcation will be used by both fellow academics and people\n\
    involved in almost all steps of the agricultural production chain towards a bouquet\
    \ of meaningful\nresearch directions.\nWithin this review work we presented several\
    \ studies, focusing on intelligent agricultural\ninformation handling methodologies,\
    \ for improving and/or gaining insight into a multitude of\ndifferent tasks within\
    \ the agricultural domain. We organized the aforementioned studies into three\n\
    major categories, namely data sources and collection, machine learning methodologies\
    \ for agricultural\ndata, and ﬁnally, intelligent knowledge acquisition. We believe\
    \ that the economic importance of\nagricultural industry worldwide demands the\
    \ development of innovative methodologies for precision\nand optimal farming.\
    \ Irrespectively of the geographical region at hand, the harvest varies from year\n\
    to year due to soil conditions, disease, pests, climate and variation in yield\
    \ management practices.\nThese factors make the production of high quality produce\
    \ a rather challenging task. Still, traditional\nand innovative computational\
    \ methodologies, such as image analysis, remote monitoring and Machine\nLearning\
    \ have the potential to provide an inexpensive, non-destructive way of capturing\
    \ precise\ninformation about the crop. From the analysis of the herein included\
    \ research works it is rather evident\nthat the particular problems identiﬁed\
    \ within most agricultural learning applications are focused on\nthe speciﬁc models\
    \ and frameworks employed, the sources, the actual nature and pre-processing of\n\
    data used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics deployed\
    \ for each research\nwork. Agricultural monitoring provide data and knowledge\
    \ for deep learning and other existing\npopular computational techniques, in respect\
    \ to differences in classiﬁcation or regression performance.\nConsidering the\
    \ impact and applicability of Machine Learning, our motivation was to identify\
    \ the main\nrecent trends within this particular application domain, in order\
    \ to facilitate a better understanding of\nthe speciﬁc ﬁeld for future studies.\n\
    Overall, a clear trend is to be identiﬁed and this may be summarized into the\
    \ active utilization of\nMachine Learning methodologies for a multitude of agricultural\
    \ tasks. Our future plans include the\nexamination of innovative areas of smart\
    \ agriculture in narrower, yet trending, application domains,\nlike speciﬁc popular\
    \ social networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.), so as to be able to monitor\
    \ evolving\ntrends in agricultural data utilization and identify potential new\
    \ emerging data models in the process.\nClearly, it is not possible to tackle\
    \ all aspects of modern agricultural-related computing in a single paper\nnor\
    \ discuss all expressions in the process and consequently several open remaining\
    \ issues are to be\nidentiﬁed by the experienced reader as food for thoughts.\
    \ The latter should also take into account not\nonly the researchers’, but also\
    \ the developers’ point of view on the matter. Developers are encouraged\nto take\
    \ this survey’s observations into account, but at the same time they would need\
    \ to do so without\nsacriﬁcing the required usability or without increasing the\
    \ related computational complexity of their\napplications in the process. All\
    \ these remarks are considered to be crucial for enabling sufﬁcient\nand innovative\
    \ agricultural information distribution in wide-area, real-life deployments, both\
    \ within\ncurrent and future informatics’ applications, system and scientiﬁc research.\n\

  title: A Survey on Intelligent Agricultural Information Handling Methodologies
  verbatim_quote1: '"When dealing with intelligent agricultural information and data,

    performance achieved according to the metrics deployed for each research work.
    Agricultural monitoring provide data and knowledge for deep learning and other
    existing popular computational techniques, in respect to differences in classification
    or regression performance. Considering the impact and applicability of Machine

  analysis: 'Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use


    - The review explains the importance of collecting and using different data types
    to advance critical zone (CZ) science. This includes collecting data on soil moisture,
    canopy temperature, weather, chemical parameters and many other data types. This
    detailed data collection can help address grand challenges related to food production,
    climate change and other imminent threats.

    - The paper discusses how automated systems for real-time data collection, transmission
    and processing have been deployed in many critical zone observatories (CZOs).
    Examples of such systems include wireless sensor networks, automated weather stations,
    camera traps, and remote sensing platforms, drones and portable spectroscopy tools.
    This automation has enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of data collection, and
    broadened our understanding of complex earth processes and their response to climatic
    and anthropogenic disturbances.

    - Further, the review emphasizes the need for interoperability and standardization
    in data collection and management to enable data sharing and synthesis across
    automated irrigation management systems. This includes developing common data
    formats, ontologies, and metadata standards to facilitate data integration and
    analysis.

    - The review identifies challenges and potential solutions for data sharing and
    synthesis. These challenges include data quality, scalability, and accessibility.
    Potential solutions include developing data quality control protocols, using cloud-based
    platforms for data storage and analysis, and implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
    Interoperable, Reusable) data principles.

    - Lastly, the review highlights the importance of data harmonization and integration
    to enable cross-site and cross-network analysis. This involves developing methods
    to harmonize data from different sources, and to integrate data from different
    disciplines to provide a more comprehensive understanding of CZ processes.


    Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of
    data collection, management, and analysis in CZ science. It identifies key challenges
    and opportunities for advancing data sharing and synthesis, and provides recommendations
    for future research and development.


    Overall the paper contributes to addressing the point within the larger context
    and intent of the review.'

    Abstract The critical zone (CZ) includes natural and anthropogenic environments,
    where life, energy and matter cycles combine in complex interactions in time and
    space. Critical zone observatories (CZOs) have been established around the world,
    yet their limitations in space and duration of observations, as well as the oft-existing
    dominant disciplinary research field(s) of each CZO may limit the transferability
    of the local knowledge to other settings or hinder integrative CZ understanding.
    In this regard, this review advocates for cross-site cross-network collaborations
    in CZ sciences. We posit that this type of collaboration is becoming indispensable
    for understanding past trends and future trajectories of the CZ, in the context
    of fast-developing and widespread environmental changes. Aided by a series of
    cyberseminars and a community survey, we highlight some of the existing cross-site
    initiatives, tools and techniques, and the cross-cutting science questions that
    could benefit from such cross-network syntheses, in various types of CZ settings
    (montane, alpine, arctic, managed and agricultural environments, lakes, wetlands,
    streams, landscapes disturbed by drought and/or wildfire, etc.). This review also
    identifies and discusses the major and legitimate concerns and obstacles for a
    collaborative CZ approach, including data harmonization and integration of social
    sciences, and proposes tentative ways forward. Previous article in issue Next

    datasets 1. Critical zone science: What? Why? Where? 1.1. What is the critical
    zone and what are critical zone observatories? In 2001, a panel of the US National
    Research Council (NRC, 2001) put forward the critical zone concept and defined
    it as “a heterogeneous, near surface environment in which complex interactions
    involving rock, soil, water, air, and living organisms regulate the natural habitat
    and determine availability of life sustaining resources.” Simply put, the critical
    zone (CZ) is where most life forms have strived on Earth, and the natural habitat
    where our basic human needs such as water, food, and energy are sustained. In
    the critical zone, life, energy and matter cycles organize at a variety of scales
    (Chorover et al., 2007, Perdrial et al., 2015), among which the watershed (or
    fluvial catchment) may constitute a fundamental control volume (Rinaldo and Rodriguez-Iturbe,
    2022). To apprehend the daunting complexity of these natural cycles and, crucially,
    how ongoing anthropogenic changes have been impacting critical zone and watershed
    functioning (e.g., Goddéris and Brantley, 2013), numerous long-term critical zone
    observatories (CZOs) and watershed sites have been established throughout the
    world (Brantley et al., 2017, Richter and Mobley, 2009). In the United States,
    the National Science Foundation (NSF) recognized the significant role that the
    critical zone plays in the existence of life on Earth and created the Critical
    Zone Observatory (CZO) program (Giardino and Houser, 2015, White et al., 2015).
    This was followed by the establishment of Soil Transformations in European Catchments
    (SoilTrEC, Banwart et al., 2011) by the consortium of European Union members.
    Today, there are numerous CZOs spread across the world; however, not all of these
    belong to a formally funded network (see Section 1.3). The term CZO, as defined
    here, is therefore used to describe any instrumented field site used for monitoring
    energy, water, and material fluxes, and biogeochemical cycles - from unaltered
    bedrock to the atmospheric boundary layer, across terrestrial and aquatic interfaces,
    and across climatic and hydrobiogeochemical gradients (Guo and Lin, 2016, Lin
    et al., 2011). 1.2. Why are critical zone observatories needed? CZ science integrates
    our understanding of how water moves from the top of the canopy (e.g., trees,
    grass, crops) to the depths of circulating groundwater (Anderson et al., 2008,
    Brantley et al., 2007). CZ science also helps us quantify how long water is retained
    in aquifers, how much water goes to vegetation to support carbon fixation versus
    shunted to our streams, lakes, and reservoirs, and what controls the quality of
    our freshwater resources. Ultimately, it is this holistic discipline that helps
    us understand the mechanisms and rates at which multiple Earth surface processes
    and biogeochemical cycles occur, and how these may change in response to climate
    change, land-use practices, and changing disturbance regimes. To this end, CZ
    science has enabled advances in sensing and tracing technologies that have improved
    resolution and frequency in monitoring the hidden subsurface (Barclay et al.,
    2022, Mangel et al., 2022). CZ science has also fostered the growth of high-fidelity
    reactive transport models that test our understanding of processes (Stolze et
    al., 2022) and can reach beyond spatial and temporal scales of measurements (Li
    et al., 2017, Steefel et al., 2015). Taken together, the substantial body of CZ
    research provides a strong foundation for quantifying nutrient dynamics, greenhouse
    gas emissions, as well as water and energy exchange in the critical zone (Arora
    et al., 2022a, Cheng et al., 2018, Chorover et al., 2011). It is important to
    acknowledge that a robust predictive understanding of how CZ and watersheds function
    and respond to disturbances is necessary to tackle some of the biggest challenges
    for the 21st century, such as water security, food and energy production, and
    sustainable ecosystem services. Despite significant advancements in hydrology
    (e.g., Hrachowitz et al., 2013, McDonnell et al., 2007), soil science (e.g., Tokunaga
    et al., 2019, Vereecken et al., 2016), ecology (Dawson et al., 2020), geomicrobiology
    (Rillig et al., 2019), biogeochemistry (e.g., Benk et al., 2019, Waterhouse et
    al., 2021), geology (e.g., Rempe and Dietrich, 2014, White and Brantley, 2003),
    climatology (Rasmussen et al., 2011) and other fields that work in the CZ, accurately
    predicting CZ functioning requires study of the interactions among dominant processes
    across landscapes. Given this complexity, recent studies have highlighted the
    need for more holistic, integrative and multiscale approaches that work at the
    intersections of traditionally separate disciplines to advance our understanding
    of CZ functioning. For example, Saup et al. (2019) demonstrated the tight linkage
    between microbial community assembly and seasonal hydrology in the Upper Colorado
    River Basin. They make the point that understanding hydrological drivers of microbial
    activity is important for systems whose flow regime may be impacted under future
    climate scenarios. Similarly, Li et al. (2021) advocate for developing integrated
    theories at the intersection of hydrology (e.g., transit time theory) and biogeochemistry
    (e.g., reaction kinetic theories), which they argue are at the core of CZ functioning
    and necessary to improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, earth surface
    system responses to climate and human forcing. These calls for more integrated
    CZ research will require interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and adaptation of
    concepts beyond discipline-specific boundaries (Adler et al., 2021, Arora et al.,
    2022b, Brantley et al., 2017, Perdrial et al., 2015). Advancing our understanding
    of CZ functioning at relevant local and global scales also requires addressing
    the tremendous spatial variability in dominant processes across natural and human-impacted
    landscapes (Elhacham et al., 2020, Ellis et al., 2021, Grant et al., 2017). The
    importance of addressing scaling effects in CZ science is easily illustrated when
    considering the cascading impacts of changes in climate and land cover/use on
    water quality in large watersheds. For example, the Mississippi River starts as
    a humble 6 m wide knee-deep creek in north-central Minnesota. As it flows southward,
    it picks up excessive nutrients from the agricultural and urban landscapes in
    the center of the continental United States, before discharging into the Gulf
    of Mexico and creating an expansive “dead zone” of 16,405 km2 (NOAA, 2021). Another
    example is the Yellow River, a major drinking water source in China and the second-longest
    in Asia, that has been suffering from extensive contamination and is now on the
    verge of becoming unfit for even industrial or agricultural use (Dwivedi et al.,
    2022a). Existing CZOs do not operate at these scales, so it is important to consider
    the representativeness of individual CZ sites for larger systems and consider
    opportunities for cross-site synthesis to grasp the impact of spatial variability
    on downstream conditions. Further, while the scale and complexity of these water
    quality impacts is daunting, large investments have already been made in developing
    these CZO sites, which constitute collecting phenomenally diverse and distributed
    watershed datasets, including many associated with autonomous sensing systems.
    It is worthwhile to acknowledge that comparable measurements exist at CZOs at
    national and international scales. Together, these datasets share many common
    attributes, but differ by important aspects such as geophysical attributes, climatic
    conditions, plant functional types, biodiversity, inherent complexity (e.g., natural/built
    environment), disturbance types (e.g., fire, heat wave, flooding, mining) and
    time since disturbance (e.g., logging, insect infestation). An international network
    of watersheds and CZOs can serve as a vehicle for knowledge exchange, integration,
    and scientific discovery. Strengths of such a network include its ability to detect
    emergent scale properties of watershed and CZ function at local to regional and
    global scales, and provide an in-depth understanding of the spatially heterogeneous
    impact of disturbances on watershed function. 1.3. Where are critical zone observatories
    located? As suggested above, these CZOs are located worldwide (Fig. 1). However,
    these individual sites have traditionally operated in silos with frequent emphasis
    on their specific design, regional setting, and priority science questions that
    have resulted in customized data collection, theories and modeling approaches
    (Arora et al., 2021, Brantley et al., 2021, Lesmes et al., 2020). While there
    is a wide diversity of sites (Fig. 1), a common challenge across these sites is
    to understand and predict how sustainable or vulnerable these habitats and associated
    services are in the face of compounding and co-occurring climatic disturbances
    and rapidly growing population, industrialization and urbanization. Download :

    note that the land coverage is not evenly distributed. (source: https://www.czen.org/site_seeker,
    last access 12 September 2022, and several sites in Canada by personal communication
    with individual site investigators). Many of these CZOs belong to a larger network
    (e.g., DOE Watersheds, CZCN, OZCAR, TERENO) that were designed with specific strategic
    goals; however, there are many sites (including those not listed on this map)
    that are well established (e.g., long-term, interdisciplinary, indigenous community-led)
    but not formally part of a funded network and therefore lacking in aspects that
    promote data sharing/cross-site comparisons. There is room to advocate for both
    individual and larger-scale CZO network development and network-of-networks. For
    example, there is significant underrepresentation of the intertropical belt among
    the established CZOs (Fig. 1), although this latitudinal range harbors over half
    of the world population, two-thirds of the terrestrial plant biomass (Chapin et
    al., 2002), and may face some of the most dramatic impacts of ongoing global changes
    (Mamalakis et al., 2021). Connecting individual sites in a network-of-networks
    fashion in the inter-tropical belt is likely to be impactful in transforming our
    understanding of CZ functioning in these regions. Based on this assessment, we
    first present an overview of where the lack of a network-of-networks organization
    comes at a substantial cost to the CZ community through missed opportunities to
    address scientific challenges (Section 2). We then describe existing cross-site
    cross-network initiatives and where these initiatives are urgently needed (Section
    3). In the same spirit, we list available and emerging synthesis, tools and techniques
    that provide a springboard for new modes of collaboration (Section 4). We then
    summarize the challenges within the context of implementing a network-of-networks
    model (Section 5). In the same section, we also highlight community debates regarding
    the need to integrate human and social perspectives in CZ science (Section 5.2).
    We identify-three areas of greatest need in order to achieve higher rates of data
    sharing and reuse under a network-of-networks framework: open and standardized
    metadata guidelines, data harmonization, and a new class of CZ information scientists
    (Section 6.1). We suggest specific guidance for addressing these needs and describe
    the principles for enhancing cross-site and cross-network collaborations in the
    CZ (Section 6.2). The proposed network-of-networks model is expected to promote
    synthesis/integration activities across CZ networks, develop transferable tools,
    data and workflows, train next generation of CZ scientists, open new sources of
    funding, build personal connections and human-to-human interaction, as well as
    engage CZ site managers and relevant stakeholders. The network-of-networks setup
    is presented as a framework for improving how human management decisions and adaptation
    strategies impact CZ functioning at a global scale, informing policy development
    and enabling socio-ecological innovations (Section 6.2). The paper concludes with
    a recommendation to develop an open, inclusive, international network-of-networks
    framework that promotes the use of the “best available” science to address the
    most pressing challenges of the CZ (Section 7). 2. The need for a radical collaboration
    across CZOs The CZO concept has been successful in integrating across diverse
    and distributed measurements for the purposes of understanding the complex and
    tightly coupled interactions of hydrological, biogeochemical, geological, microbiological,
    and ecological processes at an intensively-monitored site (Anderson et al., 2008,
    Kulmala, 2018). However, CZOs require massive investment and coordination between
    dozens of scientists to gain this in-depth understanding (Guo and Lin, 2016).
    Moreover, the technologies needed to observe key ecosystem fluxes directly, including
    evapotranspiration and greenhouse gas fluxes (e.g., FLUXNET, Pastorello et al.,
    2020) and indirectly such as biogeochemical transformations and nutrient uptake
    (e.g., NutNet, Adler et al., 2011), often need to be observed at very fine spatial
    scales (e.g. 0.01 km2, Baldocchi et al., 2001) or in-situ (Morin et al., 2017,
    Petrescu et al., 2015). As such, the knowledge obtained from CZOs is challenging
    to apply directly to the large areas we seek to manage and/or protect, for example
    the Mississippi Basin or the Yellow River. Beyond the spatial context that is
    critical for underpinning resource management decisions, co-occurring and compounding
    disturbances are testing the resilience of CZ and watersheds in new and poorly
    understood ways. Natural and anthropogenic forms of disturbance are pushing these
    systems to tipping points beyond which many previously stationary environmental
    rates – including rates of erosion and sediment control, groundwater recharge,
    contaminant mitigation and associated microbial and ecological processing (among
    others) - are rapidly changing (e.g., McDowell et al., 2008, Newcomer et al.,
    2021, Wohl, 2013). This has had devastating effects on biodiversity and ecosystem
    services in the CZ (Díaz et al., 2019). Co-occurring disturbances, such as water
    and resource extraction combined with widespread drought are leaving little for
    ecological communities, while compound disturbances are exacerbating soil fertility
    and water quality issues. Recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC, 2021) stress a clear urgency to understand how natural systems,
    including CZ and watersheds, will respond to disturbance. Models predict that
    the global water cycle will intensify under a warming climate where for each 1
    °C rise in temperature, global precipitation is projected to increase approximately
    1 – 3 % (IPCC, 2013, Roque-Malo and Kumar, 2017); however, this increase is not
    expected to be uniform across latitudes or seasons (Xie et al., 2015). By integrating
    information from several CZOs, we can answer questions about how multiple processes
    are coupled, how they vary across broad gradients, and how they respond to disturbance
    (e.g., Gaillardet et al., 2018). For instance, a large river basin like the Mississippi
    basin is typically studied through CZOs that occupy a tiny proportion of its area.
    Through traditional modes of inquiry, this implies that the community has assembled
    a substantial body of observations and process-specific interpretations that are
    relevant to the intensely monitored CZO site(s). However, we are still lacking
    a unified conceptual framework that can translate this knowledge into transferable
    and generalizable concepts. But, working across CZO networks, for example, in
    France and Germany in addition to the Mississippi basin CZOs, could yield a detailed
    understanding of how diverse environments function and respond to future disturbances.
    At the very least, such an approach would enable unifying data, theories and models
    across CZOs and disturbance events with the capacity to test hypotheses across
    a larger parameter space than would be possible within any single CZO. It is precisely
    this rationale that underpins the development of CZO networks, and its logical
    extension is that coordination across networks is needed as greater scales are
    to be assessed. Considering the presence of pre-existing networks of CZOs usually
    maintained by a particular national government and focused largely within its
    territory, it follows that a continental to global focus of inquiry requires some
    degree of working across these already-established networks. The Global Ecosystem
    Research Infrastructure (GERI, Loescher et al., 2022), which collaborates with
    five major ecosystem research infrastructures around the globe (NEON/North America,
    eLTER/Europe, ICOS/Europe, TERN/Australia, CERN/Asia, and SAEON/Africa) is a good
    example of an established network-of-networks. Further, there have been calls
    for an integrated earth observatory (e.g., Kulmala, 2018) as the best means to
    address global problems such as climate change. However, it is important to recognize
    that such an effort requires detailed ground data including, but not limited to,
    soil properties, nutrient stocks and transformations, carbon pools and transformations,
    and microbial functioning, to constrain processes such as greenhouse gas fluxes,
    nutrient transformations, and hydrological processes (Arora et al., 2016, Vicca
    et al., 2018, Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020) as well as assessing the response to
    disturbance (Graham et al., 2021, Grant et al., 2019). Providing such data will
    require a global coordinated effort and is likely to require working across networks
    of CZOs. Integrating and collaborating across these observatories and networks
    also becomes increasingly indispensable for understanding how CZ might behave
    under conditions substantially different from the present ones. For example, in
    a microbial context, an outstanding science question is to understand to what
    degree the response of a microbial community to a disturbance is ecosystem-limited,
    and can the response be generalized as a functional trait that could then be used
    to make predictions and management decisions regarding future events. If microbial
    datasets are collected in standardized ways across the global CZ, these data types
    can be used to reveal generalizable patterns, rules, concepts, and theories tied
    to a broad range of microbial properties related to ecology (e.g., large-scale
    diversity gradients), evolution (e.g., processes governing strain variation),
    and function (e.g., microbial food webs structured by metabolite exchange). Taking
    a coordinated approach spanning CZOs will dramatically accelerate the pursuit
    of generalizable or transferable knowledge, which is essential to develop predictive
    models (e.g., Earth system models) that are ultimately tied to developing solutions
    to sustainably manage ecosystems following disturbance. More generally, working
    across networks of CZOs can help test the generality of concepts and hypotheses
    (e.g., Jansson and Hofmockel, 2020) and generate new hypotheses for further evaluation
    via modeling and targeted data generation. 3. Opportunities to conduct cross-site
    cross-network science 3.1. Examples of existing cross-site initiatives Although
    limited in number, recent studies that are targeting data from multiple international
    sites are far-reaching and already creating paradigm shifts in our understanding
    of watershed and CZ functioning (e.g., Tiegs et al., 2019, Migliavacca et al.,
    2021). As an example, a global analysis of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams
    spanning more than 200 dry riverbeds across major environmental gradients and
    climate zones is providing important insights on terrestrial plant litter dynamics
    (Datry et al., 2018). Another example is a global low-cost analysis using household
    tea bags – known as the TeaComposition Initiative - to elucidate microbial carbon
    cycling across ecosystems and climatic regions (Djukic et al., 2021). There are
    also significant emerging efforts focused on collecting extensive observations
    of hydroclimatic, microbial and hydrologic variables across diverse environments
    (e.g., CHOSEN, WHONDRS) (Zhang et al., 2021, Stegen and Goldman, 2018). A recent
    study by Ward et al. (2022) further demonstrates the power of prodding such extensive
    datasets using machine learning approaches. Focused on river corridor science,
    their study uncovered relationships that would not have been possible through
    traditional, deductive approaches to science. However, we must recognize that
    cross-site initiatives and data gathering efforts that cover a large spatial domain,
    but do not provide a holistic, interdisciplinary view of CZ processes may not
    be enough to advance CZ science. For instance, the NSF has taken a step to address
    this challenge by reorganizing their CZO program to develop 10 new Critical Zone
    Collaborative Networks (CZCNs) that all but one focus on science/hypothesis driven
    research across multiple, national CZ sites. The last CZCN funding supports the
    development of a network coordinating hub. Although limited to the national scale,
    these multi-site investigations and hub are expected to not only improve our understanding
    of CZ dynamics, but also provide a platform to facilitate exchange of data, information
    and learning opportunities for CZ scientists and students alike. With this in
    mind, outcomes from globally-distributed efforts like intermittent rivers, CHOSEN,
    WHONDRS and the TeaComposition Initiative as well as NSF-led national efforts
    can be powerful catalysts for further cross-network integration and coordination.
    3.2. Opportunities for new cross-network synthesis identified through CZ community
    discussions Below, we highlight some increasingly urgent science questions that
    could benefit from cross-site and cross-network collaborations. These are assembled
    from a recent cyberseminar series (CUAHSI, 2021a) showcasing CZOs across bioclimatic
    settings, key science questions being addressed at each CZO, and perceptual models
    developed at each site that could be tested across a diversity of CZO sites to
    improve process understanding (Table 1). These encompass montane, alpine and arctic,
    managed and agricultural, drought and wildfire impacted, as well as lake, wetland
    and stream environments. As would be obvious, there are opportunities for improved
    understanding of CZ processes in landscapes not described here or discussed during
    the cyberseminar series. To expand on this further, the next section (section
    3.3) describes these outstanding opportunities with an acute focus on urban landscapes.
    Table 1. Examples of science questions and perceptual models that can be tested
    across similar CZO settings as identified by CUAHSI cyberseminar participants
    (CUAHSI, 2021a). Type of CZO setting Cross-cutting science questions Perceptual
    models  Montane environments How does water partition along steep mountainous
    gradients as a function of snow dynamics and watershed characteristics? Catchments
    with faster drainage rates are generally less sensitive to changes in precipitation
    inputs. What is a dominant control on CZ thickness? Vegetation plays an important
    (if not dominant) role in transforming bedrock to regolith. What impact does water
    table fluctuations have on exports and river chemistry? Spatially-variable exports
    in response to water table fluctuations can be aggregated into an integrated watershed
    concentration-discharge (C-Q) signature. How does deep bedrock weathering govern
    elemental exports? Plant-microbe-mineral interactions act together to alter water
    and solute exports from deep bedrock. Do sediment fluxes in mountainous areas
    show increasing trends under climate change? The relationship between mountainous
    sediment yield and precipitation is opposite to the Langbein-Schumm curve. Alpine
    and Arctic environments Is the Arctic becoming wetter or drier due to environmental
    changes? Thermokarst and preferential flow occurrence is increasing in Arctic
    environments. How to foster awareness (education, communities) about environmental
    issues and ongoing/future disturbances based on the richness of observatory-based
    research across networks? Cross-network permafrost research is necessary to assess
    the magnitude and persistence of responses, for example climate feedback. Warming
    brings increasingly synchronized greening and flowering across a range of elevation.
    Is there a threshold due to, for example, cooler temperatures at more extreme
    elevations? Photosynthesis (GPP) sensitivity to CO2 elevation depends on ecosystem
    altitude. There is a trend towards earlier spring snowmelt, but delayed spring
    snowmelt runoff is being increasingly observed; why? At a minimum, the net impact
    of climate and permafrost changes will be determined primarily by hydrological
    connectivity. Managed and agricultural environments In dry sedimentary and agro-expanding
    regions, what are the most relevant groundwater-mediated mechanisms dictating
    the outcome of plant water uptake (evapotranspiration) versus stream runoff “competition”?
    While plants can use unsaturated, riparian and saturated water stores to fulfill
    their demand, deepening stream incisions in dry sedimentary and agro-expanding
    regions can lower groundwater accessible to plants. In carbonate-dominated dryland
    CZ sites, what factors control CO2 efflux under natural versus irrigated systems?
    The major controlling factors on CO2 efflux in irrigated systems with pedogenic
    carbonates are soil substrates, climatic conditions (evaporation to push the saturation
    rates), irrigation style (water chemistry and intensity) and the competition between
    dissolution and precipitation reactions. What impact does groundwater pumping
    have on streamflow?  In tropical hardrock aquifers, intense and/or sustained groundwater
    pumping for irrigation may create an inverse groundwater level gradient as compared
    to topography, create spatially and temporally intermittent groundwater connectivity,
    disconnect streams and groundwater, and eventually dry out streams. Landscapes
    disturbed by drought and/or wildfire Do climate induced changes in landscape characteristics
    and hydrology (e.g., permafrost thaw and transition to forest cover) change an
    environment''s vulnerability to drought and wildfire? Heavily managed landscapes
    (e.g., forest monocultures, landscape drainage for agriculture, urban) are not
    as resilient to drought and/or wildfire as natural landscapes. What is the relationship
    between surface water-groundwater interactions and drought vulnerability in semi-arid
    and/or seasonally frozen environments? Drought clearly impacts the water cycle
    across varied landscapes, but wildfire disturbance does not necessarily result
    in significant change in dominant hydrological processes. Disturbance can induce
    changes in biogeochemical characteristics/functioning of streams. How do repeated
    wildfire events impact the hydrological, biogeochemical and microbial conditions
    of a river and its watershed? The concentration of some solutes (e.g., nitrate)
    in the stream increases as the area of burn increases. However, not all water
    quality parameters respond in the same manner, suggesting that watersheds can
    have significant buffering/resilience capacity to fire disturbance. Does anthropogenic
    land use change in deep loess landforms (e.g., transition from cropland to orchards)
    change the landscapes vulnerability to drought? Anthropogenic land use change
    in deep loess landscapes can lead to soil degradation, vegetation die-off, afforestation
    failure, soil drought, and changes in the C and N accumulation in soils. What
    are the long term effects of sustained multi-year drought on forest ecosystem
    functions and susceptibility to pests? Drought and extreme storms can exacerbate
    insect infestations in forested environments. Lakes, wetlands and streams What
    drives biogeochemical and geomorphological changes in coastal ecosystems? Marshes
    migrate inland due to coastal changes (e.g., sea level rise and flooding), resulting
    in drastic changes to prevailing ecosystems (e.g. forests). Is global warming
    causing a deterioration of water quality of lakes? Climate change affects the
    ecosystem of lakes through changes in water temperatures and mixing and stratification
    behavior, and thus oxygen and matter exchange, which leads to algal blooms. How
    do fresh and marine hydrologic pulses interact with other long-term changes and
    disturbances to influence ecosystem trajectories? The deposition of phosphorus
    rich sediments by marine pulses (i.e. hurricanes) has a positive effect on the
    mangrove ecosystems (fertilization effect and elevation gain). 3.3. Other examples
    of outstanding CZ-related challenges Although not explicitly discussed during
    the 2021 CUAHSI cyberseminar series (or described in Table 1), there are opportunities
    for improved understanding of CZ processes in other landscapes undergoing rapid
    and drastic change, for example tropical forested landscapes, urban areas (especially
    those along coastlines), intermittent river and variably inundated settings. Below,
    we take the example of urban landscapes to illustrate how we could benefit from
    a concerted effort to generate and test hypotheses through synthesizing and analyzing
    information across a variety of sites and networks. As shown in Fig. 1, urban
    landscapes can be classified as ‘Developed - High’ land cover according to National
    Land Cover Database (Dewitz and U.S. Geological Survey, 2021), which includes
    4 sites (Eel River CZO, Central Arizona - Phoenix LTER, Baltimore Ecosystem Study,
    and Plum Island Ecosystem LTER) and as ‘Developed - Low’ that includes 17 additional
    sites. More recently, the NSF CZCN funding was awarded to develop an urban CZ
    cluster spanning four cities in the U.S. East Coast (Philadelphia, Baltimore,
    Washington D.C., and Raleigh) (Weniger et al., 2021). The north–south gradient
    these sites fall along captures climatic trends and urban development trends (i.e.,
    older and denser development in Philadelphia and Baltimore to newer and sparser
    development in Raleigh). This urban CZ cluster is focused on addressing the drivers
    of solute export dynamics in urban areas, including the potential importance of
    climate, urban density, underlying geology, and the unique hydrological functioning
    of urban landscapes. The OZCAR network in France also has several urban impacted
    sites, including Fontaine de Vaucluse near Nîmes, the OTHU Yzeron site near Lyon,
    and the OSUNA-IRSTV-ONEVU site near Nantes. Urban research catchment sites that
    are not part of an existing CZ network also exist, for example, the Black Creek
    Research Catchment in Toronto, Canada and a number of urban-impacted catchments
    across Berlin, Germany (Kuhlemann et al., 2020, Kuhlemann et al., 2022), which
    have both been used to deepen our understanding of water ages and their relationship
    to solute transport in urban streams. Across these sites, many unanswered research
    questions related to the impacts of urban development on CZ processes have emerged.
    For example, the role of pervious areas (e.g., lawns, parks, brownfields, riparian
    areas) in the transport of water and solutes to receiving waters (Ariano and Oswald,
    2022), as well as, spatial and temporal variability in greenhouse gas fluxes,
    is starting to receive more attention. Notable in urban pervious areas is the
    heterogeneity of urban soils due to human disturbance (e.g., construction activities,
    compaction). The influence of these patterns on pollutant sources and transport,
    and the success of urban vegetation deserves additional attention. There is also
    an emerging interest in quantifying the ecohydrological partitioning of precipitation
    into ‘blue fluxes’ and ‘green fluxes’ in urban greenspaces (Gillefalk et al.,
    2022, Marx et al., 2022) and the role of different vegetation species, which are
    usually heavily managed, on these fluxes. Investigations into the dominant biogeochemical
    processes facilitating the mobilization of contaminants of emerging concern (e.g.,
    plastics, plastic-associated contaminants, pharmaceuticals), which are often concentrated
    in areas with high population density, are also increasing (Kaushal et al., 2020,
    Fork et al., 2021, Werbowski et al., 2021). The role of wastewater as a pathway
    for contaminants of emerging concern to enter surface waters, and the impacts
    of wastewater contributions on stream biogeochemical processing in general, are
    of interest. While many of these lines of inquiry could be investigated within
    a single CZO or research catchment, there are clear benefits to addressing these
    questions across networks and urban CZ sites. There are fundamental differences
    in the materials and plans of cities, including the types of infrastructure in
    place and management practices, which may have an outsized impact on the importance
    of these processes. For example, older cities may have more degraded sewer infrastructure,
    which could lead to more wastewater inputs to surface water systems. Although
    we could examine how urban CZ processes are impacted across climatic gradients
    in a manner similar to any cross-site, cross-network study; here, we have the
    opportunity to prioritize examining gradients of urbanization (e.g., there may
    be different processes occurring in areas with low levels of urban land cover
    versus heavily urbanized areas). Since urban CZ science has not been a traditional
    priority (i.e., it is atypical to have as many urban sites in one country as the
    U.S. or France), leveraging measurements across multiple sites is advantageous
    for inferring process from pattern. Other outstanding, overarching CZ research
    questions include: How do different CZ/watershed sites respond to similar compound
    and co-occurring disturbances? What determines differences in site responses to
    similar disturbances? How does environmental history modulate these responses?
    To what extent are model/machine learning parameters transferable to untested
    sites and unforeseen conditions? What tools exist to make the data more accessible
    and open for cross-site cross-network comparisons? 4. Available and emerging synthesis,
    tools and techniques In this section, we focus on highlighting available and emerging
    tools and techniques for cross-site, cross-network science that were identified
    by seminar participants in a second CUAHSI cyberseminar series (CUAHSI, 2021b).
    4.1. Existing and emerging frameworks and platforms for successful data synthesis
    As suggested above, there now exist a few, albeit limited, studies targeting global
    standardized experiments and developing flexible tools with data from multiple
    international sites. Crucial enablers of such synthesis activities are existing
    and emerging interoperable portals for browsing, sharing, publishing, and analyzing
    CZ data. These include the CUAHSI HydroClient (https://data.cuahsi.org) and HydroShare
    (https://hydroshare.org) portals, the global scale OZCAR-Theia data portal (Braud
    et al., 2020, https://in-situ.theia-land.fr/), the TERENO data discovery portal
    (https://ddp.tereno.net/ddp/), the Department of Energy’s ESS-DIVE portal on watershed
    and instrumented sites (https://ess-dive.lbl.gov/), or the Macrosheds portal for
    US stream and watershed data (https://cuahsi.shinyapps.io/macrosheds/). The latter
    also includes tools for training models with hosted datasets. Another example
    is the Datastream portal hosted by the Gordon Foundation (https://gordonfoundation.ca/initiatives/datastream/),
    which makes it easy to share and access water quality data. A more extensive listing
    of existing regional and international data portals is provided in Table 2. We
    recognize that the highly distributed nature of CZ data repositories - as is evident
    from Table 2 - can require substantial efforts in ensuring data access and discovery.
    In section 6.1.1., we make recommendations on how to make these data easily and
    automatically accessible and discoverable through a global catalog of CZ data
    stores across networks. However, efforts to institute a data collection or storage
    standard will likely have the effect of stifling innovation in CZ science, while
    also becoming unwieldy. Rather than standardize data collection or storage, we
    argue for the development of shared metadata template(s). These must be developed
    as a community effort and would enable more efficient but flexible data storage,
    collection, and discovery (see section 6.1.1 for further details). Table 2. Examples
    of large datasets or data portals related to the CZ, grouped into categories of
    observables; from multidisciplinary to discipline- or compartment-specific instances.

    National dataset of streamflow isotopes Canada Stream water isotopes Gibson et
    al. 2021  Data link Online infrastructures integrating models and data analyses
    are emerging as well, from large platforms such as the IDEAS-Watersheds Software
    Ecosystem, https://ideas-productivity.org/ideas-watersheds/) which comprises workflow
    tools, interface libraries and a variety of codes for reactive transport, hydrological
    or land surface modeling, all the way to specific toolboxes such as BridgET (https://github.com/KIT-HYD/bridget)
    for comparing and scaling evapotranspiration estimates. Beyond existing portals,
    synthesis activities have been focused on curating specific CZ data from a variety
    of sites. Successful examples of such activities include the Soil Water Infiltration
    Global (SWIG) database, which includes more than 5000 infiltration curves covering
    all continents with an acute focus on developing, evaluating and validating infiltration
    processes across a range of models (Rahmati et al., 2018). In the United States,
    the CHOSEN (Comprehensive Hydrologic Observatory Sensor Network) is a database
    of streamflow, soil moisture, and other hydroclimatic and hydrologic variables,
    a comparative analysis of which highlighted complex patterns in hydrological extremes
    across different US regions thereby advocating for long-term observatories (Zhang
    et al., 2021). Other efforts focused on global datasets of high-dimensional, high-resolution
    microbial properties and processes across diverse CZ environments are also emerging.
    In this regard, the Worldwide Hydrobiogeochemistry Observation Network for Dynamic
    River Systems (WHONDRS) has been carrying out crowdsourced sampling campaigns
    that span numerous networks and countries, though significant global gaps remain
    (Stegen and Goldman, 2018). In this campaign, the microbial data - once fully
    available - can provide a foundation to elucidate organizing principles governing
    spatial and temporal patterns in microbial composition (e.g., which microbes are
    where) and function (e.g., what genes are expressed before/after disturbance).
    These microbe-oriented questions are particularly important in the CZ and Earth
    System functioning at large, as microbes are primary catalysts for organic matter
    transformations tied to greenhouse gas production and global biogeochemical cycles.
    Such data collection and integration efforts are important for bridging scales
    as they can provide standardized and transferable insights across the globe. 4.2.
    State-of-the-art tools and techniques for reducing complexity Beyond data integration
    portals and frameworks, conducting synthesis crucially relies on translating complex
    CZ information into a compelling scientific narrative. One approach to reducing
    complexity in studied systems -even more so across a large array of observation
    sites- is to use dimensionless numbers. This is because dimensionless numbers
    have the potential to collapse the scatter in data, highlight scale invariance,
    express the competition between processes, and allow for comparing datasets, model
    outputs, and/or locations with different characteristic ranges. Classical examples
    include the Reynolds number in fluid dynamics (Abraham, 1970), the combination
    of the dryness and evaporative indices (both dimensionless) in the Budyko curve
    in hydroclimatology (e.g., Berghuijs et al., 2014), the Damkhöler number in reactive
    transport, or the Hillslope number in hydrology (e.g., Brutsaert, 1994, Berne
    et al., 2005). A related approach to reducing complexity in studied systems relies
    on a mix of hydrological (or biogeochemical/ecological/climatic) signatures. For
    instance, Braud et al. (2021) used a number of hydrological signatures such as
    baseflow index, flow duration curve slope, and event recession curve indices,
    together with a cluster analysis, to classify OZCAR sites across four continents.
    Their approach was quite scalable and would be straightforward to apply to even
    larger networks of data, and has the potential to allow fairly broad classifications
    of catchments based on function. In a separate cross-site study, Ross et al. (2021)
    used the idea of hydrological thresholds of intensity and storage to analyze 21
    catchments across the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In particular, they
    identified thresholds in runoff response at all but one catchment, and concluded
    that threshold behavior can be one basis of studying a large number of catchments.
    Another approach builds on the idea of using stream properties (e.g., solutes
    concentrations) as a proxy for upstream CZ structure and processes, with the most
    widely-used approach being the concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationship where
    river discharge rate (Q) reflects different CZ compartments mobilized (e.g., Gaillardet
    et al., 1999, Stewart et al., 2022). Rather than absolute solute concentration
    or river discharge, one can use the relationship between the two, or with dimensionless
    numbers such as concentration ratios, or even their derivatives (differential
    C-Q analysis, Arora et al., 2020), to collapse data scattering and reflect CZ
    functioning, but more importantly to facilitate synthesis and hypothesis testing
    across diverse observatories. Some of these non-exclusive approaches can further
    track the transient nature of underlying CZ processes, both in time (“hot moments”)
    and space (“hot spots”) within the studied landscape and time periods, using dedicated
    methods such as wavelets and wavelet-entropy analysis (e.g., Arora et al., 2019,
    Grande et al., 2022). Cross-CZ synthesis efforts may also benefit from overcoming
    “small scale paradigms”, as only very few out of various candidate CZ processes
    may actually play a role at larger scales or explain inter-site variability (e.g.,
    Adler et al., 2021). Data analysis methods aimed at dimensionality reduction (e.g.,
    principal component analysis, isometric feature mapping) can be a path forward
    to identifying these key drivers or processes (e.g., Schilli et al, 2010 on soil
    solution characterization, or Wlostowski et al., 2021 on hydrological signatures).
    These data analysis techniques have been increasingly combined with, or paralleled
    by, machine learning (ML) techniques (e.g., Zhi et al., 2021), which allow for
    CZ drivers and patterns to be identified with minimal a priori knowledge. If sufficient
    data points are available, ML is often considered to be more flexible than other
    approaches as it does not need all data to be rigidly collected with the same
    frame (Dwivedi et al., 2022b, Varadharajan et al., 2022). Its application in CZ
    science is still in its infancy, notably due to significant challenges such as
    the interpretability and physical consistency of ML models, the need to include
    complexity and uncertainty of training data in ML models, and the enormous computational
    resources needed in many ML applications (Reichstein et al., 2019, Sahu et al.,
    2020, Burdett and Wellen, 2022). For example, Burdett and Wellen (2022) found
    that while ML approaches outperformed more conventional statistical techniques
    in the prediction of crop yield from soil properties, an attempt to quantify the
    most important factors for prediction revealed substantial uncertainty. While
    the two predictors with the highest level of variable importance in a random forest
    model alone were able to achieve very strong fits to the crop yield data, a model
    nearly as strong was assembled from the three variables of lowest importance.
    However, ML is a fast-growing field of research and some of these challenges are
    already being addressed. For instance, hybrid methods are increasingly being applied,
    such as differential parameter learning where the training focuses on calibrating
    the parameters of a process-based model efficiently yielding spatially and physically
    coherent parameter configurations for distributed simulations (Tsai et al., 2021).
    The need for synthesis studies and cross-site CZ analyses have also promoted the
    search for reliable proxies where data gaps exist. For instance, electrical conductivity
    (EC) is often used as a proxy for chloride concentrations in urban systems, allowing
    a continuous record to be reliably derived from a relatively small number of grab
    samples (Moore et al., 2019). The mechanisms for why EC influences chloride so
    consistently are well established - at very high Cl concentrations, the Cl contributed
    from road deicers is the main source of ionic strength (Cooper et al., 2014).
    Other proxies for chemical constituents have a much less consistently reliable
    relation with important variables. For instance, FDOM (fluorescent dissolved organic
    matter) sensors allow dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to be monitored, but often
    corrections are required to account for turbidity, temperature, and other important
    variables (Downing et al., 2012). Turbidity sensors often have strong relationships
    with total suspended solids and total phosphorus, and often reasonable relationships
    with dissolved phosphorus, but the strength of these relationships varies substantially,
    even in areas with similar climate and geology (e.g., Biagi et al., 2022, Robertson
    et al., 2018, Ross et al., 2022). Presumably the details of the erosional processes
    and also the biogeochemistry dictate this relationship. A widespread network effort
    could provide a mechanistic understanding of why certain sensors are reliable
    proxies for water quality parameters in some catchments but not others, and could
    help manage expectations of sensors (e.g., Rode et al., 2016). A host of other
    sensors are used to monitor various CZ processes, e.g. soil moisture, snowfall,
    precipitation, vegetation cover (Phenocam, Sonnentag et al., 2012), water quality,
    and others. Previous intercomparison studies have reported significant variability
    across sensors when different sensors are sensing the same variable in the same
    place (e.g., soil moisture, Jackisch et al., 2020; snowfall, Kochendorfer et al.,
    2022). As such, a large, distributed sensor intercomparison study would be necessary
    when integrating data across many sites, and instrument to instrument conversion
    factors may be estimated. Such a study would also be quite informative for research
    that relied on a specific sensor, as they would have a sense of how specific their
    results are to the sensor they used. Furthermore, working across CZOs allows us
    to evaluate the applicability of sensing technologies for earth science monitoring
    (e.g., drones, in situ gravimetry, air borne cosmic-ray neutron sensing, weighable
    high-precision lysimeter, eddy covariance, in situ isotopic tracing, fiber optic
    installations, environmental DNA and “omics”) to other contexts (e.g., mining,
    urban planning, wildlife monitoring, medical sciences). 4.3. Examples of bringing
    CZ science into the Anthropocene There has been a broad recognition that we have
    entered into the Anthropocene, the era of human domination of earth’s ecosystems
    (Lewis and Maslin, 2015, Vitousek et al., 1997). Accordingly, there is a need
    to better understand how environmental science generally, and CZ science specifically,
    can better ask and answer questions related to human-environment interaction.
    Our final cyberseminar (CUAHSI, 2021b) addressed exactly this question. Abbott
    et al. (2019a) talked about the centrality of human interaction in the water cycle,
    and contrasted this centrality with the typically pristine representation of the
    global water cycle in literature, including scientific literature. For instance,
    human water appropriation equals about half of global river discharge, yet only
    15 % of water cycle diagrams depict this interaction (Abbott et al., 2019b). In
    fact, the icon for the CZNet program in the US shows no human influences, despite
    a number of CZ sites being located in areas of intense human activity (agricultural
    or urban areas). Given that such diagrams are a point of entry to CZ for many
    people, both inside and outside of academia, recognizing and correcting this misrepresentation
    is an important step towards awareness and equitable development in the Anthropocene.
    While efforts in this direction have included updated diagrams on the websites
    of the Australian CZO network (https://www.tern.org.au/critical-zone/) and the
    OZCAR/Theia data portal (https://www.theia-land.fr/theiaozcar-un-portail-unique-dedie-aux-donnees-dobservation-in-situ/),
    only recently did the U. S. Geological Survey provide a radical update for its
    classic diagram of the water cycle, this time “with humans as showrunners” (Duncombe,
    2022). Taking this viewpoint further, other cyberseminar participants talked about
    the importance of societal engagement and design approaches in CZ science. In
    particular, Arènes et al. (2018) highlighted that the CZ depiction to the general
    public is in the form of ‘planetary view’ of the Earth made familiar since the
    time of the scientific revolution and reinforced by the iconic image of the Blue
    Planet (Grevsmühl, 2014). Their work therefore tried to develop a different visual
    representation that captured the complex, heterogeneous and dynamic nature of
    the CZ to faithfully target practitioners and stakeholders that CZ scientists
    try to address through their science. They approached this through a unique collaboration
    between an architect, a sociologist engaged in the CZ field and a geochemist who
    heads the CZO network in France. This work has since been further extended into
    a book involving two architects and a science historian (Aït-Touati et al., 2019),
    and a museum installation that mimics a CZ observatory in Strengbach in France
    at a scale of 1:80 to adequately describe the design of the CZOs (https://critical-zones.zkm.de).
    Other examples of alternative representations of natural environments and processes
    following the same philosophical viewpoint are recent works from the Monsoon research
    group mapping rain (http://monass.org/, Bremner, 2021), the Forensic Architecture
    tracing chemicals in the atmosphere (https://forensic-architecture.org/), and
    the Italian Limes following the “moving border across Italy’s glaciers” (http://www.italianlimes.net/).
    Other ways of societal engagement include Design Thinking, which includes a work
    process that puts users first and works through an iterative process designed
    to understand users and their problems, prototype solutions, test them, and iterate
    to arrive at better solutions (Liedtka, 2015). Goi and Tan (2021) suggested that
    Design Thinking must entail a deep understanding of the perspective of those it
    is aimed at, and thereby, could lead to more inclusive social innovations that
    involve stakeholders from various backgrounds. Their work also highlights the
    key role played by empathy with the example of constructing a map with audio guide
    to promote Ena City and its “noren” (split) curtains as Japanese culture. Finally,
    Marie Toussaint highlighted the importance of ecocide, and the importance of ensuring
    that human interaction with ecosystems is done in a way that allows ecosystems
    to renew themselves (CUAHSI, 2021b). Toussaint also highlighted that people who
    work directly with nature (e.g., farmers, hunters, indigenous peoples) know a
    lot about nature. Involving such people in CZO site selection, priority setting,
    and experimental design, could be quite valuable. 5. Challenges to a network-of-networks
    model 5.1. Insights from community feedback To gather community inputs on the
    challenges and opportunities to conduct CZ synthesis and integration activities,
    we designed an online survey questionnaire. The explicit goal of the survey was
    to identify, define, and provide a stimulus for initiating integration and exchange
    of data, tools, models, and frameworks that enable cross-site cross-network analyses.
    The survey was conducted on a voluntary basis with participants from different
    CZO networks and single CZOs (Fig. 1A). Survey questions included available tools,
    simulation codes and openly available data, as well as perceived challenges associated
    with synthesizing across diverse CZ sites. We received a total of 130 responses
    from across CZO sites and networks (Fig. 2A), with respondents working across
    different agencies, institutions and disciplines. Based on this feedback, we identified
    several pressing needs and challenges that the CZ community are tackling related
    to integration and open sharing. Along with those pressing needs and challenges,
    the survey also highlighted what appeared to be major obstacles to the construction
    of cross-site cross-network collaboration (Fig. 2B). CZ respondents felt that
    key barriers to collaboration included “missing data harmonization”, “data access
    availability” and “lack of funding”. Additional obstacles were identified as the
    “lack of human connection” and “the environmental cost”. The time needed to build
    a trusting collaboration, parachute science and environmental justice issues were
    identified as “other” obstacles. Below, we describe in detail on how these obstacles
    constitute legitimate concerns for network-of-networks synthesis activities and
    solutions or partial solutions to navigating these concerns. Download : Download

    The primary obstacles to developing a cross-site cross-network collaboration as
    identified by the survey participants. Survey participants identified ease of
    access to data from across CZ networks and harmonizing those data as key requirements
    for successful intercomparison of results across networks, sites, time periods
    and techniques. However, the accuracy and implementation of data collection techniques
    and tools vary depending on numerous aspects such as CZO type, the goal of the
    intercomparison study, and practical field constraints. While there are existing
    examples of data harmonization (e.g., Wieder et al., 2021) and existing portals
    of data targeting CZ research (see Section 4.1), an increasing emphasis on standardized
    data collection protocols, commonly-agreed upon data harmonization strategy and
    developments in cyberinfrastructure tools could significantly enhance opportunities
    for data discovery and cross-site cross-network collaborations. Another obstacle
    to cross-site cross-network collaboration was highlighted as the lack of availability,
    accessibility or existence of funding to support international collaborations.
    While not abundant, some funding resources do exist. Classic examples that support
    such activities include the Powell Center and LTER synthesis proposals. Other
    examples include the Berkeley-France Fund (https://fbf.berkeley.edu/) or the German
    academic exchange service through DAAD (https://www.daad.de/en/), but these resources
    are limited to network exchange only. Some funding resources, while available,
    are restricted to specific disciplines such as iDiv for biology science (https://www.idiv.de/en)
    or techniques such as eddy covariance through the FLUXNET network (https://fluxnet.org/).
    In countries where a formal CZO funding source is itself lacking (e.g., Canada),
    it can be even more difficult to look for funding for international collaborations.
    Given this background, it is evident that the CZ community needs to advocate for
    an international cross-site cross-network collaboration funded at a global scale,
    as is the case for the IODP (international ocean discovery program; https://www.iodp.org/)
    and the ICDP (international continental drilling program; https://www.icdp-online.org/home/).
    Examples of other funding setups include: i) The European-funded COST actions:
    An example is the WATer isotopeS in the critical zONe (WATSON, https://watson-cost.eu),
    which focuses on building a European community around isotope-enabled tracking
    of water pathways in the CZ. It fosters knowledge exchange and new insights through
    a) funding short stays for visiting scholars and recurring workshops, b) encouraging
    building collaborative data portals and c) linking functional and spatial scales
    ii) For arctic ecosystems (and more widely alpine/subarctic ecosystems) the INTERACT
    network can be used to fund field trip to stations over the northern hemisphere,
    but they also offer remote and virtual access to over 89 terrestrial field bases
    (https://eu-interact.org/) iii) The ERC synergy grants (https://erc.europa.eu/funding/synergy-grants)
    can go up to 10 M€ over 6 years and involve one non-EU co-PI. While elements of
    collaboration and coordination can be achieved through these funding setups, we
    believe that the reach of the current CZ networks and the extent of scientific
    exchange could be vastly improved through a global network-of-network setup. Such
    programs could fulfill the urgent need for international funding to support CZ
    synthesis/integration activities at a worldwide scale. Beyond the monetary and
    science-based obstacles, the survey also raised the fact that building a collaboration
    demands human-to-human interaction. Such interaction would promote interest in
    developing cross-cutting science questions that go beyond a single site and prompt
    discussions on transferability and interoperability of tools, data collection
    techniques and modeling frameworks. It is important to recognize that while social
    interactions can be easy in this day and age, developing personal connections
    can prove to be time-consuming and environmentally costly. For a socially-inclusive,
    global network-of-networks setup that promotes in-person interactions, navigating
    the environmental cost of travel can be a significant concern. And, this leads
    back to the need to advocate for an international collaboration funded at a global
    scale that supports this kind of expenditure but also promotes medium- to long-term
    engagement from relevant stakeholders, communities, and nonscientific experts
    to come together to understand and address CZ challenges. This solution could
    also partially address the still-existing problem of parachute science, occurring
    mostly in lower-income countries (Stefanoudis et al., 2021), and could entail
    a mandatory linking of external collaborators of the sites to the native collaborators
    for any experiments, building skills and valorization of works (conference, article,
    etc.). 5.2. Integrating social science with CZ research Although not explicitly
    addressed through the survey, we believe that a close integration of social science
    with CZ science is critical to answering the most pressing challenges in CZ research.
    Because CZOs involve human habitats and human impacted areas, the need and establishment
    of a cross-site, cross-network collaboration should be used as an opportunity
    to intentionally and tightly integrate social sciences with CZ sciences. Barriers
    to such an integration have been highlighted as a combination of a lack of formal
    criteria emphasizing disciplinary research, cultural and career barriers, lack
    of linkage to industry, a conservative educational system and lack of strategic
    focus by universities (Holm et al., 2013). In fact, Holm et al. (2013) argue for
    a ‘‘revolution’’ in education and capacity building that is deemed necessary in
    response to urgent environmental and social challenges. Indeed, there is increasing
    scientific evidence that human migration (Black et al., 2011) or social collapse
    can be due in whole (Zheng et al., 2014) or in part (Shaw, 2003) to environmental
    changes in the CZ (Scheffer, 2009). In tandem, an increasing number of IPCC reports
    are highlighting the impacts of climate change on human society (IPCC, 2001, IPCC,
    2007, IPCC, 2014, IPCC, 2022; etc.). Moreover, recent decades have highlighted
    that scientific understandings have often been poorly reflected in public policy
    and sometimes disregarded entirely when solely using a “supply-side model of science”
    (Oreskes, 2022). Together, these lines of evidence suggest an urgent need for
    integrating CZ research with human and social sciences. The human and social sciences
    encompass many disciplines, but in the case of integration with the CZ, a first
    level of integration should at a minimum include sociology (such as linkages with
    demographics and anthropological studies), political science (to integrate with
    public management aspects), economics and geographical science (e.g., studies
    of climate change impacts on the economics of societies and human migration),
    as well as human science such as history and archeology. To further this integration,
    such cross-disciplinary studies should be embedded in education programs. An example
    of such integration is the Earth Politics Center created in Paris in the Fall
    of 2019 that aims to address the complex issues of the Anthropocene by the convergence
    of natural and experimental sciences with the human and social sciences (https://u-paris.fr/centre-politiques-terre/en/the-earth-politics-center/).
    Likewise, there is emerging interest in community perceptions and attitudes to
    environmental change to promote communication of critical resources within the
    CZ and improve adaptive capacity. For example, Grunblatt and Alessa (2017) compared
    science-based assessment of environmental changes to society''s perceived notion
    of it, and showed diverse individual notions regarding the impact of humans on
    climate change. But, more importantly, Grunblatt and Alessa (2017) argued that
    these perceived notions can be changed through inclusive dialogue and engagement.
    An example where such dialogue is being facilitated is in a project called “Sentinelles
    des Alpes” set up by the Zone Atelier Alpes observation and research facility
    in France that specifically partners social researchers with local actors such
    as mountain guides, alpine hut keepers and/or regional parks workers. The project
    allows the sharing of experiences around important issues and the identification
    of potential avenues for synergies both in terms of research questions and more
    methodological aspects across 5 mountain socio-ecosystems, each led by a researcher
    and a local actor. This project resulted in a communication video to raise awareness
    on these alpine systems, which is also accessible to the general public (http://www.za-alpes.org/Le-programme-Sentinelles-des-Alpes).
    An example of where such human dialogue and connection will be important is urban
    CZ science. Including human dialogue in CZ science will allow us to question how
    humans and nature interact, whether new metrics ought to be sought, and what kinds
    of corresponding data should be collected about human activities in specific CZ
    areas, such as urban sites. It therefore clearly appears that in the current context
    of a society totally dependent on inevitable climate and environmental changes,
    the inclusion of human sciences as part of the CZ science is essential. 6. The
    path forward 6.1. Principles for enhancing cross-site cross-network collaboration
    in the CZ In this section, we highlight the most important needs for enhancing
    integration/synthesis activities in the CZ as identified through the cyberseminar
    series and community feedback − 1) the need for open, standardized, global metadata;
    2) the need for more efforts on data harmonization, and 3) the need for a new
    class of CZ data scientists. Going beyond technical innovations and towards collaborations
    in the CZ community, our main recommendation is to develop an open, inclusive,
    international network-of-networks framework that promotes the use of the “best
    available” science to address the most pressing challenges of the CZ. 6.1.1. The
    need for global metadata for CZ science Ensuring cross-site cross-network CZ collaboration
    will require a number of technical innovations that have already begun, but require
    significant additional developments to help bring about open and networked science.
    Specifically, workflows are needed that enable data to be discovered, accessed,
    and harmonized. Data discovery refers to the ability to locate and understand
    data sets that exist, while access refers to the ability to obtain these datasets.
    In Section 4.1, we enumerated many CZ networks that made data available, and each
    one enables discovery across its own network. More and more of these networks
    structure their workflow and data life cycle requirements to make used data FAIR
    (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). The existing data portals work
    quite well when seeking to access data within one network. However, when integrating
    data across multiple networks, the existing approach is quite cumbersome, as one
    must learn the terminology, interface, and other aspects of every individual network.
    Moreover, data integration is particularly challenging in the highly multidisciplinary
    field of CZ science, due to the inherent diversity of the data that may be combined
    in a single portal, in both type (climate, ecology, geochemistry, genomics, etc.)
    and associated spatio-temporal scales (see, for example Table 2). Given this background,
    it is obvious that some kind of global catalog of networks is needed, and for
    this to be developed, some agreement on a harmonized metadata template is needed.
    This calls for having extensive metadata associated with the databases, ideally
    built in from the start in a robust data management plan, to avoid unforeseen
    discrepancies as the database grows. In practice, this implies making metadata
    generation and upload easy and user-friendly for data uploaders, and FAIR and
    open for the targeted users. Though not explicitly included in FAIR principles,
    the use of digital object identifiers (DOIs) for datasets and published algorithms
    has been an oft-mentioned need as well (CUAHSI, 2021a, CUAHSI, 2021b). DOIs allow
    resources such as data or code to be unambiguously identified and cited, enabling
    much more transparency in research within and across networks. 6.1.2. The need
    for semantics to power data harmonization Data discovery is simply a first step
    of working across networks. A much more difficult issue, and one that arguably
    has not been addressed as well as discovery, is that of harmonization. Harmonization
    refers to taking data sets from a number of different sources and having them
    conform to a particular schema for a particular purpose. Barriers to CZ data harmonization
    were discussed in detail in the second CUAHSI cyberseminar series (CUAHSI, 2021b).
    Todd-Brown et al. (2022) reported on an interview study with eight research group
    leaders who had constructed harmonized soil carbon datasets from pre-existing
    data. They found that while discovery tools were quite useful and available, there
    were virtually none dedicated to data harmonization. Harmonization was usually
    accomplished in a manual, ad-hoc manner, which proved to be quite labor intensive,
    error prone, and constituted no data provenance (detailed explanation of how the
    harmonized data was sourced from primary measurements). The data model that each
    group settled on for harmonized data tended to be dependent on the question they
    asked. This suggests that it is unrealistic to have a single data template or
    schema even for soil carbon work, let alone for CZ research. These results suggest
    the need for more research into data harmonization in CZ science. A generalized
    approach to data harmonization proved to be quite useful as shown in the SoDaH
    project (Wieder et al. 2021), where raw soil carbon data were annotated with a
    generalized metadata template. Such a generalized template allowed data to be
    mapped from whatever format they were collected into, to a format useful for a
    specific aggregated analysis, avoiding the need for a universal data storage schema.
    However, the specific templates employed in SoDaH were focused on soil carbon.
    Different questions and different source data may require a revisit to the templates
    used, should an approach similar to SoDaH be implemented more broadly. These lessons
    learned in the soils field are likely to apply to the wider field of CZ science.
    If international CZ networks become linked together, we will need to develop ways
    to harmonize data across multiple schemas. For instance, the Theia/OZCAR network
    has opted to use a specific database schema for data across its network (Braud
    et al., 2020). It is quite possible that should a researcher wish to integrate
    OZCAR data with any other network’s data, they would encounter harmonization difficulties
    similar to those encountered by Todd-Brown’s (2022) interviewees. As a solution
    to this ‘tower of babel’ problem when working across disciplines, researchers
    have advocated for the use of formal ontologies (e.g., Sieber et al., 2011). Formal
    ontologies encode the domain knowledge of a community into a set of logical statements
    using classes, properties, and instances (Uschold and Gruninger, 1996). Importantly,
    formal ontologies are machine-processable and can be used for discovery and harmonization.
    Sieber et al. (2011) show how formal ontologies can be used for data discovery
    (and harmonization to some extent) across multiple databases of Chinese history.
    Wellen and Sieber (2013) question the use of formal ontologies of earth features
    due to significant natural language differences of those features. However, in
    a more restrictive context of sharing and harmonizing data across CZ networks,
    formal ontologies may be a useful tool. Nascent examples of such an ontology exist.
    For instance, the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry has an
    environment ontology (ENVO, Buttigieg et al., 2016) but it was not created to
    help scientists collaborate and is likely too broad for the purposes of CZ synthesis/integration
    activities. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has created an ontology of earth
    science concepts called SWEET (Semantic Web for Earth and Environment Technology;
    DiGiuseppe et al., 2014) that might be a promising start to a community ontology
    to enable data sharing and harmonization across CZ networks. Future research is
    needed to examine whether formal ontologies are appropriate underpinnings for
    data harmonization tools, or whether a schema driven approach such as the SoDaH
    project might be more appropriate, or whether other avenues may be needed. 6.1.3.
    Towards a new class of CZ information scientists Given that data harmonization
    and integration were identified as a bottleneck for any CZ synthesis effort, and
    the highly multidisciplinary field of CZ science, the cyberseminar series (CUAHSI,
    2021b) clearly highlighted the need for a new class of CZ information scientists.
    This meant involving scientist-users “in a hands-on way” in the design process
    of the data portals, working hand in hand with the database professionals to make
    sure that technical proficiency meets the users’ needs. Community feedback from
    the survey further implied looking beyond researchers and actively engaging database
    users and creators, such as data scientists, managers and state agencies. Such
    synergies are expected to better connect long-term data portals with short-term
    and/or project-based data collection and may even incentivize data rescue, i.e.
    merging and harmonizing existing sparse records into a long-term dataset meeting
    the aforementioned standards. In the long-term, CZ science as a community of practice
    should integrate more advanced data literacy training for students and early career
    researchers. A move in this direction will help to develop a new generation of
    CZ scientists with a more holistic skillset. 6.1.4. An open, international network-of-networks
    framework as a way forward To sustain CZ science into the future, we need an open,
    inclusive, international network-of-networks framework that helps overcome some
    of the issues that limit our progress. Such a framework is expected to not only
    promote synthesis/integration activities across CZ networks, but also open new
    sources of funding, build personal connections and human-to-human interaction,
    as well as engage CZ site managers and stakeholders at a level not previously
    accomplished. The inclusive and open nature of such a network is expected to better
    address inequalities in the sciences such as gender (e.g., Ranganathan et al.,
    2021) and ethnic and racial diversity (e.g., Bernard and Cooperdock, 2018) and
    improve the representation of women of color and white women in these fields,
    as well as promote ethnic and racial diversity. Networking with diverse stakeholders
    (e.g., women in science, underrepresented communities) is not only intended to
    create awareness regarding diverse needs, but to build partnerships that potentially
    contribute to more innovative ways of coordinating and sharing research. But,
    perhaps, more importantly, such a network is expected to leave behind a multigenerational
    legacy by training, educating and mentoring future CZ scientists, and act as a
    host for transferable tools, data and workflows (Fig. 3). Training for students
    and early career researchers as well as sharing of educational resources within
    this networking framework will be instrumental in propagating the novel tools,
    data and workflows developed herein. We expect such cross-network activities to
    at-a-minimum enable sharing of education materials, enhance engagement in cross-country
    Citizen Science projects, and increase participation in international summer schools.
    Consequently, a network-based approach is expected to enhance interpersonal interactions
    and establish career-spanning, collegial relationships and friendships. The power
    of such a network lies in its ability to mobilize people and further empower CZ
    students, early careers and scientists to pursue the pathbreaking questions that
    address the most complex as well as socially-relevant problems of our time. Download

    Towards an open, international network-of-networks framework that can help resolve
    the most urgent gaps in rapidly changing ecosystems and enable next generation
    innovation in CZ science. One approach to facilitating a global network-of-networks
    framework is through the use of ICON science principles. These principles focus
    on the intentional design of research efforts to be “Integrated” across disciplines
    and scales, “Coordinated” through the use of consistent methods, “Open” throughout
    the research lifecycle (including publication of FAIR metadata and data), and
    “Networked” with a broad range of stakeholders to understand and respond to collective
    needs, priorities, perspectives, and risks (Goldman et al., 2022). For example,
    the Coordinated component of ICON is focused on intentional a priori planning
    and implementation of strategies to generate FAIR metadata and data that are generated
    in a standardized format as well as consistently structured upon publication.
    Further, these consistent protocols are expected to be Openly shared and framed
    based on multidisciplinary (i.e., Integrated) feedback/consensus (i.e., Networked).
    Using the ICON principles together is therefore meant to enable development of
    knowledge, data, and models that are generalizable or transferable across diverse
    settings. Additionally, ICON is meant to enable research outcomes that are mutually
    beneficial across stakeholders, ranging from core research teams to land owners/managers
    to the general public. Producing research outcomes that are transferable and mutually
    beneficial does not happen by chance. It requires a priori planning and design,
    which can again be facilitated by using ICON principles to help build an international
    networks-of-networks for the CZ. Using a Networked approach is vital to this process,
    whereby open discussions and anonymous reporting across stakeholders can be used
    to understand needs and collectively work towards solutions. Although ICON can
    be applied to any scientific domain, it can be a particularly powerful tool for
    CZ science due to the diversity of systems, people, priorities, and limitations
    that need to be considered collectively to meet both fundamental and applied science
    challenges associated with the CZ. In this regard, the ICON Science Cooperative
    (https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/icon-science) is developing open resources to facilitate
    the use of ICON principles by researchers at any career or project stage (e.g.,
    developing proposals, modifying existing projects). The CZ community can use and
    contribute to these resources to facilitate the intentional development of networks-of-networks
    and enhance the benefit of these efforts across a broad range of stakeholders.
    6.2. From observatory to living lab - using CZOs to address global societal challenges
    Many CZOs have been intentionally designed to monitor how human actions affect
    the coupled processes in the CZ (e.g., agricultural areas and managed watersheds),
    and herein, we propose that these individual sites and CZ networks together can
    help illuminate how humans affect the CZ across much broader gradients of climate,
    land use/management, and soil type than can be investigated at a single site.
    In this regard, a network of CZOs can provide important opportunities to identify
    the most urgent gaps, or an “indivisible problem” that cannot be tackled by a
    single person/network/agency, as well as address pressing science questions and
    societal challenges for many different environments (Fig. 3). For instance, the
    United Nations has set 17 sustainable development goals (UN SDGs) to address the
    challenges posed by human impact on many of the Earth''s cycles including the
    water cycle (Abbott et al., 2019b) and CZ science is directly or indirectly relevant
    to many of these. With a network of CZO sites in many different countries, it
    could be possible to treat a network of CZO sites as a ‘living lab’ where Design
    Thinking (see Section 4.3) and other approaches could be employed to inform policy
    development, management approaches, management tools, and other socio-ecological
    innovations in support of climate change issues, environmental sustainability
    and other relevant societal challenges. Indeed, CZOs may be ideal locations for
    inventing and prototyping new ideas regarding socio-ecosystem management, and
    cross-site cross-network collaborations could test more broadly ideas that are
    promising at a small number of sites. For instance, incentive programs to help
    farmers adopt conservation nutrient management have the potential to mitigate
    some issues associated with eutrophication of water bodies (Wilson et al., 2019),
    or promote sustainable water use that helps improve long-term water resources
    as well as reduce farmers’ socioeconomic vulnerability (Fischer et al., 2022).
    One question that arises is how best to encourage farmers to do so? This requires
    both consideration of incentives (which differ drastically in different jurisdictions
    and contexts), the biophysical environment (which also differs), and through strong
    partnerships between the researchers and the community. A recent study on agroecological
    transitions in vineyards showed that the farmer’s perception of risk could be
    mitigated by promoting environmental values as well as solutions to policy problems
    by including a team of ecologists and social scientists (Teschner and Orenstein,
    2022). In another context, precision agriculture is becoming more ubiquitous in
    a wide diversity of sites, and has been the subject of comparison studies (e.g.,
    Antle et al., 2017). Yet, there has been little work to evaluate how a move to
    precision agriculture may affect the overall functioning of the CZ. A network-of-networks
    framework can provide an important opportunity to close this gap by examining
    how human management decisions and adaptation strategies impact CZ functioning
    at a global scale. Last, but not the least, a global network of CZO sites provides
    the necessary infrastructure to better understand the functioning of the CZ, and
    share resources, both of which are essential to tackle high priority science questions
    and societal challenges (e.g., Lü et al., 2017). However, this must be followed
    by closer links between science, management and policy to improve decision making
    (Banwart et al., 2011). Hence, the understanding gained about CZ processes and
    functions, at a minimum, needs to be incorporated into quantitative decision-making
    tools designed to help environmental managers, stakeholders and policy-makers
    make decisions about adaptation and mitigation strategies (e.g., Banwart et al.,
    2013). Making this science-society integration will also crucially rely on the
    partnership with social sciences, as discussed in section 5.3. 7. Summary Given
    the inherent diversity of CZOs and variability in governing CZ processes, a systematic
    approach to tackle these challenges is needed, with future efforts decreasing
    the fragmentation of individual CZOs and watershed sites as well as openly sharing
    data, models, and tools. Now, more than ever, there is increasing recognition
    that close coordination and integration across the global distribution of watershed
    sites and CZ networks can significantly advance science, provide opportunities
    to create a shared vision, learn from each other’s mistakes, open doors for broad
    perspectives, and ultimately, address regional and national priorities. In this
    regard, a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report (NASEM,
    2020) made the case for an “all hands on deck” moment, defined as “bringing together
    a demographically and scientifically diverse group of critical zone and watershed
    scientists, working both individually and in collaborative networks, to create
    and deploy cutting-edge analytical, computational, and field-based research methods
    in an open environment where success builds expeditiously on success”. The path
    forward should include more holistic, cross-site, cross-network studies that aim
    to advance our understanding of CZ and watersheds in response to environmental,
    technological, and societal changes, and build the next generation of tools that
    are broadly applicable and transferable. There is an urgent need to build such
    a network-of-networks for several reasons. Firstly, increasing intensity and frequency
    of disturbances are pushing these systems to tipping points, such that the future
    functioning of these systems is uncertain with consequences for energy and water
    cycles, global distribution of nutrients, and human health (Armstrong McKay et
    al., 2022). A formal systematic (i.e., Coordinated) approach is therefore needed
    to work across these CZ sites and networks to develop a robust predictive understanding
    of how CZ and watersheds function and respond to compounding and co-occurring
    disturbances. Secondly, new techniques and technologies are providing observations
    that were previously not possible, such as eddy covariance-based measurements
    of N2O and other trace gasses and fiber optic-based measurements of soil temperature,
    chemical and biological properties that can be useful indicators of global climate
    change (Baldocchi, 2014, Hubbard et al., 2020). Additionally, if these unique
    and novel watershed observations across networks/sites are to be analyzed through
    AI/ML-based approaches, such approaches hold the potential to transform our understanding,
    prediction and management of CZ/watershed behavior through the rapid identification
    of system tipping point precursors; the assimilation of diverse, multi-scale data
    into models for near-real time prediction and water management; and the ability
    for models to inform real-time optimization of autonomous sensing systems – from
    local to regional to global scales. Lastly, building on the success of these approaches
    and a formal global network-of-networks collaboration would significantly advance
    the understanding of environments that are extremely vulnerable and changing at
    a rapid pace - such as those associated with coastal regions, mountain watersheds,
    arid lands, agriculture, urban ecosystems, among others. Declaration of Competing

  limitations: The paper does not provide specific examples of how data from different
    sources has been harmonized and integrated to enable cross-site and cross-network
    analysis. It would be helpful to provide some concrete examples of how this has
    been done successfully in the past. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the
    challenges associated with data quality control and data scalability. These are
    important challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure the quality
    and reliability of data from automated systems.

  title: Building Cross-Site and Cross-Network collaborations in critical zone science
  verbatim_quote1: Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature,
    weather) and their collection and use
  verbatim_quote2: Automated systems for real-time data collection, transmission and
    processing have been deployed in many critical zone observatories (CZOs). Examples
    of such systems include wireless sensor networks, automated weather stations,
    camera traps, and remote sensing platforms, drones and portable spectroscopy tools.
    This automation has enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of data collection, and
    broadened our understanding of complex earth processes and their response to climatic
    and anthropogenic disturbances.

  analysis: "In 2015, Hartman published a book titled “The Lean Farm” which highlights\
    \ how traditional practices of agriculture can be optimized by using modern work\
    \ organization practices such as lean thinking. This paper presents the findings\
    \ from a study on the use of lean principles in integrated production systems\
    \ used by small-family run farms in Portugal. For this paper, researchers chose\
    \ to study family-run farms using Integrated Production (IP) and conventional\
    \ production systems. The goal of the study was to determine if the use of lean\
    \ principles would provide a path to farm competitiveness for the small, family-run\
    \ farms. In order to collect the needed data to properly access the benefits of\
    \ a production system based on integrated production and lean thinking, direct\
    \ observation was utilized and used to create Value Stream Mapping (VSM) for harvest\
    \ and planting. \n\nTwo main types of waste were found on the farms observed.\
    \ The first is necessary tasks that do not add value to the farm product and the\
    \ second is pure waste or activities that add no value. Lean Methodology views\
    \ the elimination of the first type of waste as controversial. One example of\
    \ necessary waste is weeding. Eliminating weeds does not directly add value to\
    \ the farm product, but still must be completed. The second type of waste has\
    \ no value, does not add value, and should be removed when possible. One example\
    \ of this type of waste is excess labor or manpower that does not increase productivity.\n\
    \nBased on the research, the authors found that the farmers had already begun\
    \ applying lean principles on their farms without being aware of doing so. Some\
    \ examples of these principles were the normalization of the boxes used for harvesting\
    \ to make it easier for the customer to receive and handle the product, placing\
    \ the van close to the harvest area to reduce the amount of movement required\
    \ to transport the boxes, and normalizing the harvesting process so that all employees\
    \ were using the most efficient techniques. In addition to these already implemented\
    \ principles, the researchers also identified several opportunities for improvement\
    \ including:\n\n1. Reducing the number of rejected lettuce leaves during harvest\n\
    2. Reducing the excessive manpower and unproductive time for employees on Farm\
    \ B, particularly during planting and harvesting\n3. Reducing excessive movements\
    \ when setting up nets on the open fields on Farm B\n4. Reducing excessive movements\
    \ when washing lettuce on Farm A\n5. Reducing average lettuce delivery time to\
    \ the customer\n\nThrough the implementation of the five recommendations found\
    \ and listed above, family farms have the opportunity to increase revenue and\
    \ profitability by increasing the overall efficiency of the farm.\n\nOverall,\
    \ the study found that lean thinking, although not a new and innovative concept\
    \ in agriculture, can be a useful tool for family-run farms to increase efficiency,\
    \ competitiveness, and profitability."

    Abstract.

    Family farming has been on the agenda worldwide.

    Portugal is no exception.

    Act No.

    64/2018, published in 2018, establishes the Family Farming Statute. Its preponderance
    in food and in the

    sustainability of families and territories has been reinforced by the sustainable
    development paradigm.

    However, competitiveness constraints assigned to the production system is often
    seen as an obstacle.

    Combining the theoretical frameworks of integrated agriculture and work organizations,
    we oﬀer a lean

    sociological perspective on family farms producing lettuce. We concluded that
    their production system

    is characterized by a set of innovative practices very close to a lean approach.
    However, there is room for

    improvements in a production system that seems to maintain a family-based workforce
    and traditional

    know-how.

    1 Introduction

    Family farming is considered uncompetitive due to a multiplicity of constraints
    pointed out

    in literature. Among these, the farmers´ lack the technical and technological
    knowledge that

    would enable them to successfully plan the desired results and eﬃciently control
    production costs

    (Auerbach et al., 2013).

    Worldwide, Lowder et al. (2014) report that of the 570 million farms, more than
    500 million

    fall under the concept of family farming since their area is inferior to 2 hectares.
    They account

    for 90% of the world’s farms and produce more than 70% of the food consumed, warranting
    the

    livelihoods of 40% of the families (Lowderet al., 2014).

    Also in Portugal, according to the 2009 Agricultural Census, more than 750 thousand
    people

    work in family farms. These represent more than 90% of the total agro-rural holdings,
    with a

    used agricultural area of more than 55% of the national area and are responsible
    for more than

    50% of the country’s production (INE, 2011).

    The importance of family farming and the limitations of competitiveness imputed
    to its pro-

    duction system led us to question the work organization models on which production
    is based.

    The theoretical approach used for the analysis was that of lean production, based
    on continuous

    improvement and the minimization of waste. This methodology ﬁrst appeared in the
    Japanese

    industrial world. It has been tested in the agricultural sector in some countries
    (namely, the Uni-

    ted States and Brazil) and represents an organizational innovation with positive
    results on the

    competitiveness and long-term sustainability of this type of businesses (Hartman,
    2015; Mancini

    et al.,2016).

    In times and regions where economy is more prosperous and employment shortages
    are lower, as

    is the current situation in the north of Portugal, the lack of manpower available
    for agricultural

    activity is often a major obstacle for small farms. A key requirement of competitiveness
    for the

    farmer and family owner is the rational organization of work (GPP, 2017). Considering,
    just as

    Mention et al. (2019) that innovation is a transversal desire to all companies
    as it represents

    an improvement in their performance, a study was made about process innovation,
    mainly of an

    incremental (try to do better) more than radical type (do diﬀerent). Spacek &
    Vacik (2016) in a

    case study in a diferente economic area show that eﬃciency creates value for the
    company.

    We adopted an interdisciplinary approach that combines the theoretical and epistemological

    assumptions of agronomy, particularly of sustainable agriculture, and of the sociology
    of work

    and organizations with regard to work organization models and the premises of
    productive ef-

    fectiveness and eﬃciency. Our main objective is to understand how can family farms
    become

    more competitive by adopting the principles of lean thinking in the organization
    of work without

    undermining a territorial model based on sustainable development. That is, ensuring
    economic

    eﬃciency without disrespecting natural and human resources, namely nature and
    workers. Using

    a qualitative methodology, we discuss the results of ﬁeld observation in two family
    farms in the

    Portuguese coastal north. We wanted to know whether the work processes were close
    to, or dis-

    tant from work rationalization techniques capable of promoting a more competitive
    agricultural

    production in family farms.

    The relevance of the study lies in the importance of family farming in terms of
    agricultural

    production, household income and its decisive contribution to the balance of the
    ecosystem,

    the preservation and enhancement of native species and the promotion of short
    production and

    consumption circuits. These are key aspects of environmental sustainability.

    2 Family farming and production systems

    According to FAO (2014), family farming has a key role in economic, environmental,
    social and

    cultural development.

    Although the concept of family farming varies across countries (Suess-Reyes and
    Fuetsch, 2016),

    it is commonly accepted that it is a farming system based on small farms, mostly
    dependent on

    family labor and usually rooted in traditional practices. These small holdings
    (less than 2 ha)

    account for 12% of the world’s agricultural area – about 30 to 40% in developing
    countries and

    10% in developed countries (Lowderet al., 2016).

    Recently, family farming has become a topic of public interest following the UN’s
    recognition of

    its fundamental role in the sustainable development of territories and its declaration
    of 2014 as

    the International Year of Family Farming (FAO, 2014).

    According to the FAO (2014), family and small-scale farming is closely linked
    to global food

    security, the preservation of traditional foods, a balanced diet, the preservation
    of agrobiodiversity

    and the sustainable use of natural resources. It oﬀers an opportunity to stimulate
    local economies,

    especially when combined with speciﬁc policies designed to promote the social
    protection and

    well-being of communities.

    More recently, in November 2017, the European Commission, in its communication
    to the Euro-

    pean Parliament on the "Future of Food and Agriculture", stated that the evolution
    of agriculture

    aid includes “maintaining its market orientation and its support for the EU family
    farm model

    in all regions of the Union” (FAO, 2017).

    Generally, family farming is linked to traditional production systems based on
    ancestral kno-

    wledge handed down from generation to generation and strong local roots. With
    the scientiﬁc

    and technological development occurred in the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century,
    agriculture

    underwent great changes and began to use high quantities of production factors.
    In addition

    to machines, fertilizers and synthetic pesticides oﬀer high rates of productivity
    and worldwide

    marketing. This strategy, known as industrial and / or conventional agriculture,
    is based on

    an intensive production system that has caused major environmental problems such
    as soil and

    water pollution, intoxication and loss of food quality. With the approaching 21st
    century and

    a growing ecological awareness and societal commitment, other production systems
    emerge that

    integrate new results of science, knowledge of other disciplinary areas and traditional
    ances-

    tral knowledge. Sustainable agriculture can be seen as a development that meets
    current needs

    without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own (WCED,
    1987; Gold,

    2007). The following sustainable production systems stand out: precision agriculture
    (Bongi-

    ovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer, 2004), integrated production (Freier and Boller,
    2009), organic

    farming (IFOAM, 2020) and biodynamic agriculture (Biodynamics Association, 2020).

    sion agriculture, geographic positioning systems (GPS), geographic information
    systems (GIS),

    sensors and very sophisticated equipment are used in large and very large farms
    in extensive

    agriculture.

    In integrated production, natural resources are used to ensure long-term viable

    production. Any decision making is made after an evaluation of the action’s indispensability

    and previously deﬁned levels (thresholds). Chemical control is the last option
    (Stenberg, 2017).

    Organic farming is a way of producing high quality food and ﬁber using sustainable
    practices

    and rejecting synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. It is a type of agriculture
    that uses preventive

    and cultural methods such as crop rotation, intercropping and composting prioritizing
    soil care,

    pest and predator balance and recognizing the value of diversity and preservation
    of cultivars

    at risk. It is based on four principles: health, ecology, justice and precaution
    (IFOAM, 2020).

    Biodynamic agriculture integrates all the principles and requirements of organic
    farming and

    other traditional knowledge materialized in the use of preparations to improve
    soil and plants

    and a calendar of activities inspired by astrological information that provides
    indications of op-

    timal dates and times for diﬀerent operations respecting ecological and ethical
    principles (Paull,

    2011).

    The production system is at the farmer’s discretion. The latter’s choice is strongly
    determined

    by internal factors – personal beliefs, knowledge and routines –, as well as external
    factors –

    either the buyer’s demands, the limitations of the activity itself or its location.
    For example, a

    small farm is unlikely to be able to acquire precision farming equipment or services
    and a farm

    located in a region where available irrigation water is contaminated with synthetic
    pesticides and

    fertilizers will not be able to adhere to organic or biodynamic agriculture.

    In small-scale farms, as is the case of family farms, one way of making farming
    viable is to

    diversify supply and adopt the organic production system, thus being able to enter
    a market

    diﬀerentiated by quality.

    In situations where the family farm does not adhere to organic production by option
    or impossi-

    bility, capitalization must be attained by another route. This is the case of
    horticultural farms

    located on the NW coast of Portugal between Esposende and Póvoa where, due to
    bad past agri-

    cultural practices, the aquifer supplying the whole area for irrigation is contaminated
    with high

    amounts of fertilizers and pesticides (Melo et al., 2012). This area where 100
    years ago, in a time

    of food scarcity, human ingenuity built agricultural land on sandbanks is a place
    of intensive ve-

    getable production all year round. Crops follow each other uninterruptedly occupying
    the entire

    available area and the cultural intensity requires fertilizers and pesticides
    in order to guarantee

    the desired productivity. As a result of growing ecological awareness, agricultural
    practices are

    changing and it is nowadays more common to opt for the so-called integrated production
    system

    (Aguiar, 2011). These farmers regularly conduct soil and water analyzes and use
    alternatives

    to chemical control such as biological control practices. The vegetables produced
    in this region

    are sold to the main supermarket chains competing directly with the large farms
    in the south of

    the country or in Spain (Silva, 2020). Our analysis focuses on these farms. It
    is based on the

    theoretical hypothesis that, in order to be competitive, the small family farmer
    common in this

    region must innovate in terms of work organization in an integrated production
    system. The

    lean approach is a path of organizational innovation.

    3 Organizational innovation

    The word innovation became popular in the 1980s in Western countries. It was ﬁrst
    used in in-

    dustrial and technological policies (Guimarães, 1998) with instrumental objectives.
    In this line,

    it was allocated to knowledge production in economy and assumed an eminently technological

    feature. Scientiﬁc studies on innovation tend to show a strong trend to typiﬁcations
    according

    to diﬀerent classiﬁcation criteria: product and process innovation and more recently
    in distri-

    bution; incremental, radical and more recently disruptive innovation (eg. Nelson
    and Winter,

    1982; Christensen, 1997). These two typologies, among others, have been revisited
    and remo-

    delled in order to become heuristically eﬀective to account for the evolution
    of socio-economic

    structures. The same can be said about the notion of change that is similar to
    that of innovation

    (Damanpour, 2017). The latter “follows both historically and theoretically the
    notion of change,

    widely developed within the classical issues of Industrial, Organizations and
    Work Sociology”

    (Parente, 2005).

    With regard to the Sociology of Work, organizational innovation, formerly

    called organizational change, refers to forms of work organization primarily associated
    with the

    socio-technical approach as alternatives to Taylorism and Fayolism (Ortsman, 1978)
    and, later,

    to toyotism and lean production (Coriat, 1993). As for management, it appears
    associated with

    the notion of organizational learning (Parente, 2008).

    Whatever the discipline, technological innovation has been privileged in innovation
    studies (Da-

    manpour and Aravind, 2012), insofar as, as Drucker (1985) stressed, innovation
    is primarily

    triggered by economic motivations. The sociology of work warns that there is no
    mechanical and

    deterministic relationship between technological innovation and productivity and
    growth. The

    refusal of technological determinism by sociologists since the 1970s, namely with
    the works of the

    so-called Critical Sociology, has only recently echoed in managent and business.
    Technological

    innovation alone represents a potential for productivity and growth that is all
    the more enhanced

    if associated with organizational innovation.

    This explains why the analysis of other aspects of innovation, namely the organizational
    and

    social dimensions, is more recent (D’ Iribarne, 1987). This was pointed out by
    the Green Paper

    on Innovation in 1995. It stated that one of the main weaknesses of European innovation
    systems

    was organizational innovation, “which does not allow the renewal of currently
    ineﬀective models”

    (Comissão Europeia, 1995).

    The concept of innovation from a not only economic, but also socio-organizational
    perspective

    goes back to Schumpeter. For him, in 1934, to innovate was to revolutionize production
    routines

    beneﬁting from previously unknown possibilities (Schumpeter, 1996). Schumpeter’s
    deﬁnition of

    innovation is broader and goes beyond technological innovation. According to Kanter
    (1983),

    "it allows thinking of innovation as ‘the process of bringing and putting into
    use any form

    of problem solving’" (in Fonseca et al., 1996, p.

    195).

    Innovation can be thought of as a

    “diﬀerent way of doing things” (Fonseca et al., 1996, p. 194). As for its organizational
    dimension,

    the deﬁnition of innovation of the Oslo Manual “comprises three mains branches:
    (1) business

    practices (new methods for organizing routines and procedures); (2) workplace
    organization (new

    ways of distributing responsibilities involving employees); and (3) external relations
    (new ways

    of organizing relations with other ﬁrms or public institutions) (Alves et al.,
    2018).

    In line with the studies of the Sociology of Work, in this article, organizational
    innovation refers

    to routines and work organization processes associated with new forms of work
    organization. In

    this context, the Japanese models of organization (discussed in the following
    section) are often

    seen as an optimization of the classic proposals of the scientiﬁc organization
    of F. Taylor and H.

    Ford, even though they are still criticized for paying little attention to the
    equally impoverished

    work content and low worker empowerment.

    4 Work organization: from classic industrial models to the trans-

    versal approaches of lean thinking

    Work organization was ﬁrst considered by industrial engineers. The ﬁrst methodologies
    of work

    organization were formalized by xFrederick Taylor and Frank Gilbreth in the early
    twentieth

    century. Task fragmentation and the strict control of workers’ movements were
    seen as beneﬁcial.

    The study of work organization continued with Henry Ford who introduced a mechanical
    conveyor

    in the Taylor assembly chain making continuous and mass production possible. In
    the 1950s,

    Taiichi Ohno, an engineer born in China, sought to create competitive advantages
    through the

    optimization and improvement of work processes, developing this methodology with
    great success

    in the Toyota factory – the Toyota Production System.

    However, it was in 1990 that the lean philosophy became known worldwide after
    the publication

    of the book “The Machine That Changed the World” written by James. P. Womack in
    partnership

    with Daniel T. Jones and Daniel Roos. The book presents a study of the Japanese
    automobile

    industry, especially Toyota, focused on the reduction of unproductive times and
    waste (Womack

    et al.,2007).

    Lean production has evolved into a lean thinking philosophy with ﬁve basic principles.

    Principle 1 – Deﬁne value. The value can only be deﬁned from the customer perspective.
    This is

    the starting point of lean thinking. It identiﬁes what customers want and what
    they are willing

    to pay for. It is no use doing anything technically perfect if the customer does
    not value it.

    Principle 2 – Identify the value stream. Activities, from product design to delivery,
    must be

    identiﬁed, mapped and ranked according to the value they create. Whenever possible,
    this should

    include suppliers. Activities that do not add value to the customer are eliminated.
    Where this

    is not possible, they should be standardized and reduced to the necessary minimum.

    Principle 3 – Make the value ﬂow. The steps in a process must be interconnected
    and synch-

    ronized so that there is ﬂow between them, minimizing waiting times and batch
    creation. By

    reducing activities that do not add value, the process must evolve in order to
    become as ﬂuid

    as possible. It is the just-in-time (JIT), a system in which production and movement
    occur as

    needed.

    Principle 4 – Implement pull based production. Pull based production (or pull
    ﬂow) indicates

    that the (internal or external) customer’s order is the trigger to start the value
    and production

    ﬂow: right product at the right time and in the right amount. It is based on the
    JIT system and

    the leveling of production (known as heijunka), thus reducing stocks to a minimum.

    Aguiar, Silva, Parente, Costa

    Principle 5 – Strive for perfection continuously. The strive for perfection is
    achieved through

    a continuous improvement culture where each person in the Value Stream must identify
    and

    propose improvements in the process for which s/he is responsible in order to
    reduce or eliminate

    waste. In accomplishing the four principles mentioned above, the company will
    be contributing

    to the continuous improvement that refers to the concept of kaizen.

    Taiichi Ohno, in his professional experience and application of the Lean model,
    found three

    obstacles in the application of the Toyota Production System. He called them “The
    three MU:

    Muda, Mura e Muri.”

    The insuﬃciency of standardization and rationalization creates waste (Muda), inconsistency

    (Mura) and irrationality (Muri) in procedures and working hours that eventually
    lead to the

    production of defective products (Ohno, 1988).

    There are several lean implementation tools of which we will retain only those
    that will be applied

    in this work:

    - Value Stream Mapping (VSM) consists of identifying all tasks undertaken from
    order placement

    by the customer until delivery. It is essentially a planning tool to identify
    waste and devise solu-

    tions to eliminate it (Rother and Shook, 1999). It analyzes activity duration
    and corresponding

    costs takiing them into account in management optimization (Pinto, 2014);

    - Kaizen - corresponds to continuous improvement eﬀorts implemented by all parties.
    Its main

    focus is waste elimination (Imai, 1986);

    - MUDA (refers to waste) - Anything that does not add value is waste, so it must
    be reduced or

    eliminated (Pinto, 2014);

    - MURA (what is variable; it refers to irregularities or inconsistencies) - Variation
    in requests for

    a process or operation prevents the creation of a stable base (Pinto, 2014);

    - MURI (What is irrational; manifests itself through excess or scarcity) - The
    standardization

    of work (ensures that everyone follows the same procedure; renders processes more
    predictable,

    stable and controllable) (Pinto, 2014);

    - "5S" or more recently the "6S" refer to a set of practices that seek to reduce
    waste and improve

    the performance of processes and people through a simple approach aimed at achieving
    optimal

    conditions in the workplace (Zu et al.,2008).

    The practices have designations beginning with the letter S: Seiri(sort); Seiton(set
    in order);

    Seiso(shine); Seiketsu(standardize); Shitsuke(sustain) and the most recent "S"
    for safety. This

    lean instrument motivates workers to order, organize and tidy up the workplace
    and facilitates

    the waste reduction eﬀort. Worker involvement tends to be high and the return
    of its application

    very visible.

    The lean philosophy has been implemented in several economic sectors, namely in
    services, where

    it seeks to reduce waste, improve eﬃciency and increase productivity, nonetheless
    always focusing

    on its main objective of identifying the value to the customer (Levitt, 1972;
    Suárez-Barraza et

    al., 2012). However, references to its application in the agricultural sector
    are scarce.

    Hartman (2015) explains how he applied this methodology to his 4 ha farm in Indiana,
    United

    States of America, where he produced vegetables. He believed that farmers worked
    hard and

    that it was possible to reduce wasted eﬀort in tasks that did not add value to
    the ﬁnal product,

    increase eﬃciency, maximize proﬁt with less labor, and enjoy a more satisfying
    life. The author

    found two main types of waste on his farm: the necessary tasks, which do not add
    real value;

    and pure waste. The most controversial waste according to lean methodology is
    the ﬁrst. For

    example, eliminating weeds does not add value but it is necessary.

    Another study is that of Mancini et al(2016), who demonstrate the potential of
    this philosophy

    to improve small farm competitiveness.

    In this study, a small family producer whose main

    activity was lettuce production was chosen and exhaustively analyzed.

    They contacted this

    producer’s main customer – a restaurant – to understand how the orders were placed
    and what

    represented value for the latter. They then visited the farm, followed the diﬀerent
    phases of

    lettuce production and, after some information from the producer, elaborated the
    VSM. In this

    mapping, they identiﬁed the activities that added value, those which did not add
    value, but were

    necessary, and those that did not add value. After analyzing this tool and assuming
    that the

    producer should only produce what is requested by his/her client, a new VSM was
    elaborated

    eliminating pure waste (activities that did not add value) and suggesting some
    process changes

    to make it simpler and more continuous. They concluded that the use of lean philosophy
    in

    agriculture has great potential and oﬀer competitive advantages to small farms
    (Mancini et al.,

    2016).

    Motivated by these experiences and believing that family farms show potential
    for organizational

    innovations capable of improving their productivity, we have developed a diagnostic
    study to

    identify the extent to which work processes are close to or distant from lean
    approaches with the

    aim of oﬀering recommendations for operational improvement.

    5 Methodological strategy

    In order to diagnose the work processes implemented in family farms based on the
    principles of

    lean thinking, we combined multiple case-studies in a cross-case analysis (Yin,
    1994; Creswell,

    1994) according to the qualitative paradigm (Denzin and Lincoln, 1994).

    This is a multiple case-study of two similar cases in terms of lettuce culture.
    From the perspective

    of cross-case analysis, we resorted to a second case in order to ensure the validity
    of the analyzes

    carried out. These have been supported or rejected by a comparative and sequential
    approach.

    The fundamental choice lied in the culture to be studied, due either to the seasonal
    character of

    agricultural production or the farmers’ willingness to demonstrate their operating
    modes during

    intensive labor times. Among the work processes observed on family farms, the
    lettuce crop was

    chosen for the following reasons: i) pre-existence of the Mancini et al.,(2016)
    study that allows

    us to share knowledge and experience; ii) it is grown almost all over the world
    and on all types

    of farm (family and industrial); iii) its strong presence in the region between
    Douro and Minho,

    where our study was conducted; iv) it can take place either during autumn-winter
    in greenhouses,

    or in the open air during spring-summer. These intentionally chosen characteristics
    facilitated

    the use of the indispensable observation protocols in a relatively unknown domain.

    Two family farms were randomly selected for the analysis of lettuce production.
    They are located

    in the area of Estela, Póvoa de Varzim, and produce vegetables. In both cases,
    the household

    revenue comes from agriculture and the workforce is predominantly composed of
    family members.

    Both adopted integrated production systems. On farm A, we observed the harvest
    of greenhouse

    lettuce during winter. On farm B, we observed the planting and harvest of lettuce
    produced

    outdoors during summer.

    The main data collection techniques used were the systematic observation of work
    organization

    and verbal "why" and "how" protocols” (Bisseret et al.,1999) to question farmers
    about their

    activities. A check-list survey was also applied in order to understand: i) the
    farmers’ sociode-

    mographic characteristics and their relation to land and property; ii) the farm’s
    characteristics

    (current parcels of the holding by numbers, areas, names; the presence of cover
    / greenhouse;

    current, previous, pre-previous, and pre- pre-previous crop to get information
    on culture rotation;

    people working in the farms); iii) agricultural practices related to crop protection
    – preventive

    and curative control methods including cultural, biological and chemical methods.
    The technical

    itinerary – "theoretical technical and technological models identifying the cultural
    operations,

    tasks and technologies to be used" (Amaro et al., 2000) – was also designed with
    the farmers.

    It identiﬁes the orderly set of cultural operations and agricultural tasks associated
    with lettuce

    production.

    The observation script containing the items to be observed and the questions to
    be asked to the

    farmers were prepared with the help of an expert – a lean consultant for the industrial
    sector –

    who joined us during the observation period para auxiliar a implementação do raciocínio
    base

    do VSN.

    Initially, it was necessary to identify: the most representative client for each
    culture; the type of

    client (cooperative, association, private company, supply market, local market,
    etc.); the type of

    contract between the parties; what did the client buy and how often; the distance
    between the

    parties; how were deliveries scheduled; how were they negotiated; whether deadlines
    were met;

    whether or not there were penalties for defaults (on the customer side); how were
    sales negotiated;

    who negotiated the sales; and the time consumed with this process. Additional
    issues, such as

    price, average sales per year, and the latter’s inﬂuence on the price were also
    examined. All this

    information is decisive for a lean diagnosis.

    Direct observation focused more on a portion of lettuce cultivation on each farm.
    The observation

    script had several parts, including plot identiﬁcation (name, area, planting date
    and lettuce

    development considering the number of leaves) and the technical itinerary of the
    lettuce (machine

    organization and layout, machine distance, tools, risk protection and safety equipment,
    and

    garbage dumps).

    The technical itinerary for lettuce has been studied taking into account the following
    analytical

    dimensions:

    1. Soil preparation before the crop (soil disinfection, solarization, fertilization,
    mobilizations,

    plastic covering);

    2. Planting (how are the plants obtained – mote, alveoli or other), planting tasks;

    3. Cultural operations:

    - Irrigation (origin, type and frequency);

    - Weed elimination (soil covered with plastic, herbicide spraying, hand or mechanical
    weed re-

    moval);

    - Fertilization (direct application or fertigation and frequency);

    - Culture protection (who assesses the risk, how is it done, who decides to treat,
    how many

    treatments are done);

    4. Harvesting (how many times and for how long, including cutting, placing in
    boxes, washing

    and shipping).

    For a more detailed analysis, we have decided to observe the operative modes during
    harvest on

    both farms and planting on one farm.

    The triangulation of data collection techniques and the consequent data cross-checking
    and va-

    lidation via cross-case analysis were central to expand case analysis and particularly
    useful in

    VSM analysis.

    The observation records and the informal interviews with the farmers underwent
    a descriptive

    category content analysis. As we conducted the second observations and talked
    to the second

    farmers, we completed a transversal reading of the cases. This facilitated the
    creation of the-

    matic categories as it expanded our understanding of the technical itinerary by
    establishing

    relationships between both contexts and revealing particularities and common aspects.
    The ﬁn-

    dings allowed further expansion and revisitation to the ﬁrst case-study and generalization
    to the

    analyzed culture. The thematic categories were designed through data articulation.
    The analysis

    was systematized in a ﬂow chart.

    6 Discussion

    6.1 Characteristics of family farms

    Two farms were observed. Farm A has an area of 1.5 ha, with 0.5 ha of greenhouse,
    and farm

    B has an area of 2.35 ha, with 1.7 ha of greenhouse. Both farms have 5 plots distanced
    up to 5

    km. These two farms are similar to many others on the coast between Esposende
    and Póvoa de

    Varzim. The plots of cultivated land come from old "masseira" ﬁelds widened by
    the joining of

    continuous ﬁelds, allowing the installation of greenhouses and easier mechanization.
    Vegetables

    such as lettuce, tomato, pepper, green beans, zucchini, cucumber, onion, carrot,
    turnip and

    cabbage are almost continuously cultivated season after season, year after year.
    On farm A,

    the work focused on lettuce cultivation in greenhouse during winter and on farm
    B on lettuce

    cultivation outdoors during summer. In farm A, the owners and farmers are a couple,
    both 70

    years old and with the 4-year compulsory at education their time. They are self-employed
    and

    work full time with no paid workforce. The owner of farm B is a 28-year-old man
    who devotes

    himself full-time to family farming. His mother is a full-time wage worker and
    his grandfather,

    who is retired, works as an unpaid worker.

    Fig. 1. – VSM of farms A and B

    6.1 Lean diagnosis

    VSM was performed for greenhouse and outdoor lettuce cultivation (Figure 1) by
    observing all

    phases of the productive process on farms A and B. For each cultures’ mapping,
    we marked the

    operations performed and the execution times grouped in phases. Labor was counted
    in minutes.

    Whenever work was performed by more than one person, the recorded time was the
    sum of the

    time spent by each worker appointed to the operation.

    The VMS presented shows all the organized operations and allows us to perceive
    the whole ﬂow

    at a glance (bird eye), as Hartman (2015) did for a dairy farm in Denmark.

    A more detailed study of lean methodology was applied to harvesting on farms A
    and B and to

    planting only on farm B. The results are presented in ﬁgures 2 and 3. Activities
    that add value

    and those that do not add value, but are necessary, as well as opportunities for
    improvement

    have been noted.

    The lettuce lead time during the winter greenhouse was 70 days and the labor necessary
    to carry

    out all the cultural operations, reported to 1000 m2, was 75 hours and 17 minutes.
    The lettuce

    lead time during summer was 33 days and the labor necessary to carry out all cultural
    operations

    from land preparation to harvesting, reported to 1000 m2, was 94 hours and 40
    minutes.

    One major conclusion is that farmers already applied some lean principles on their
    farms. These

    included:

    - The normalization of the boxes used during harvesting, a principle that facilitates
    the customer

    delivery format management;

    - The van’s proximity to the harvest space when picking the lettuces, which greatly
    reduces the

    farmers’ movements and box transportation; this situation is very diﬀerent from
    that observed

    by Mancini et al. (2016) who refers to the loss of time for travel.

    - Training and standardization of harvesting work: growers harvested lettuce by
    exactly the same

    method. They knew how to cut and what leaves to remove. This meant, for example,
    that an

    entire lettuce would never be rendered unusable due to poor harvesting and it
    also made them

    faster and more productive; as mentioned by Hartman (2015), movements are rationalized
    for

    the harvest of tomatoes and cucumbers, the situation observed by us being very
    diﬀerent from

    that observed by Mancini et al (2016), which points to lost time due to overwork
    and lack of

    labor.

    - Relationship with the ﬁnal customer was based on an agreement according to which
    producers

    are quite sure that they will sell everything they produce. Producing what is
    guaranteed to

    be sold greatly reduces the risk of diﬃculties in disposing of production. In
    other words, the

    irregularities and inconsistencies that the Japanese call muraare rather small.
    However, they are

    not null, and there may be excess production due to uncontrolled situations.

    - Planting lettuce by plots at diﬀerent times also favors harvests at diﬀerent
    times for some time.

    This is an excellent example of the leveling of demand between consecutive operations,
    which

    greatly reduces the farm’s muri and there are no unexpected workloads;

    - Surface cleaning of lettuce rather than thorough washing because the customer
    does not value

    the ﬁrst. This illustrates the advantage of clarifying what is value for the customer
    and avoiding

    waste of overprocessing.

    As for improvement opportunities, we have identiﬁed:

    Fig. 3. Plantation ﬂowchart of farm B

    1. Loss of production due to an excess of rejected leaves, that is, during harvesting,
    on average,

    6 leaves out of 50 of crisphead lettuce and 8 out of 48 leaves of butterhead lettuce
    were

    rejected. We wondered whether the lettuce variety inﬂuenced the number of rejected
    leaves

    and the answer was positive. One possibility to consider is to produce more crisphead

    lettuce (which implies fewer leaves rejected) to the detriment of varieties that
    lead to more

    losses.

    2. Excessive manpower and unproductive times on farm B. Both during planting and
    harves-

    ting, there were 3 people. However, most tasks were performed by 2 people simultaneously,

    which meant that one of the persons was temporarily unemployed.

    Planting would be

    more ﬂuid if one of the workers distributed the plants so that these were closer
    to those

    who are planting. During planting, a delay of 1 hour and 40 minutes was recorded
    for the

    third person for an area of 1000 m2. During harvesting, this time raised to 7
    hours and 45

    minutes.

    3. Excessive movements in laying the net on the open air plantation on farm B.
    The net’s

    placement included extending it over the crop, placing pins in the corners for
    initial ﬁxation

    and pulling sand up the edge of the net all the way around to ﬁx it to the ground
    and

    prevent wind inlet. The last operation was done using the hands to hold the net
    down and

    the feet to move the sand. It is a laborious and delayed operation. In order to
    ﬁx the net,

    and as an alternative to laying the sand with the feet, it would be possible either
    to use

    pins along the entire net length since their placement is simple and fast, or
    to place long

    quadrangular sticks on the net;

    4. Excessive movements in lettuce washing on farm A. Lettuces are placed in boxes
    and put

    in the van, which then moves to the water point. Here, boxes are removed for washing

    (with the lettuces inside) and put back in the van. The movements linked to loading,

    unloading and reloading the boxes in the van could be reduced to a single movement
    if the

    washing operation was performed before the boxes were placed in the van with equipment

    that would not cause waterlogging inside the greenhouse.

    5. Average lettuce delivery time to the customer was 45 minutes both on farm A
    and B because

    it depended on the number of producers arriving at the delivery site simultaneously.
    This

    time loss may be due to the negotiation of diﬀerent delivery times.

    7 Conclusions

    On the family farms we analyzed, a set of practices seem close to lean methodology
    concepts,

    however in an unconscious and unintentional way. In spite of such similarity,
    there is room to

    improve operational eﬃciency.

    A lean thinking approach, although not a complete novelty for these two farms,
    if deliberately

    implemented, could be a useful organizational innovation both in the awareness
    of how eﬀective

    and eﬃcient the family farmers’ functioning is and how rationalization can be
    intensiﬁed and

    generalized to other operations, thus boosting competitiveness. There are some
    opportunities

    for improvement and adding value to the agricultural activity increasing its proﬁtability
    and

    therefore potentiating endogenous territorial development.

    This work has obvious limitations due to its exploratory character, including
    the scarce number

    of cases and planting and harvesting operations we have analyzed.

    However, thanks to an

    interdisciplinary combination of tools and knowledge, it provisionally suggests
    some opportunities

    for family agriculture through organizational innovation.

    We believe that the farmers who were the object of this study have become aware
    of the possi-

    bilities for improvement and now have an opportunity to innovate by implementing
    one or more

    of the 5 recommendations arising from this study. By applying an innovative methodology
    to

    family farming, this study oﬀered quantiﬁed values of work include in each cultivation
    operation,

    as well as of the total time (lead time). This constitutes a reference for future
    work on innovate

    practices or methods.

    However, we warn that improvements do not pervert a production system based on
    family,

    tradition and based on ancestral knowledge.

    This provides identity to agricultural activity,

    farmers and territories, and contributes to the conservation of the ecosystem.

    This study was carried out with professional family farmers, that is, individuals
    for whom agri-

    culture is the family’s sole economic activity. It would be interesting to extend
    the study to

    family farmers for whom agriculture is a complementary economic activity.

  analysis: The study uses high-resolution RGB images captured by a Phantom 4 multirotor
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to determine vegetation cover and irrigation uniformity
    in groundnut and cotton fields. The authors introduce the green-red vegetation
    index (GRVI), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-like process, and
    demonstrate its suitability for the purpose of vegetation cover determination
    and for detecting crop changes and heterogeneity in field irrigation. The study
    also examines the ability of an inexpensive RGB camera mounted on a UAV to determine
    vegetation cover and vigor. Using UAV high-resolution GRVI images, the authors
    show that the GRVI is superior to the NDVI and other vegetation indexes in detecting
    plant vigor, senescence, and irrigation uniformity. The authors conclude by discussing
    the potential applications of their work for precision irrigation and irrigation
    management, and argue that the presented tools should be available for “on-the-spot”
    farming decision-making processes.

    and content Highlights • RGB scans were used to evaluate field crops’ canopy cover
    and irrigation uniformity. • A green-red vegetation index (GRVI) was found suitable
    to evaluate vegetation cover. • GRVI successfully recognized crop changes and
    heterogeneity in field irrigation. • Low-cost technique for in-field ET coefficients
    and irrigation uniformity evaluation. Abstract Canopy cover (or vegetation cover)
    maps serve in irrigation management mainly to determine the primary evapotranspiration
    (ET) coefficient, as radiation interception and evaporative surface area are directly
    related to canopy cover. Crop size and development with time depends on water
    supply; therefore, crop canopy maps are tools for the detection of the spatial
    uniformity of irrigation systems. Several aerial scan campaigns were deployed
    in the Upper Galilee of Israel in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons to follow
    up and evaluate the irrigation uniformity and crop coefficients of peanuts and
    cotton by RGB scans of a Phantom 4 multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and
    DJI Mavic-Pro UAV equipped with RGB and near-infrared (NIR) sensors. Foliage intensity
    and coverage were enhanced by a green-red vegetation index (GRVI), which is a
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-like process where the green channel
    replaced the NIR. The results demonstrated that the GRVI is suitable for the purpose
    of determining the vegetation cover. Furthermore, the GRVI yielded better results
    than the NDVI in recognizing phenological crop changes (especially senescence)
    and in detecting heterogeneity in field irrigation. Therefore, this research proves
    the applicability of a low-cost digital camera mounted on an easily accessible
    UAV for crop cover and actual, in-field, ET coefficients determination and irrigation
    uniformity evaluation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    sensingUnmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 1. Introduction A lot of work has been done
    investigating plants’ spectral reflectance in the visible and near-infrared part
    of the electromagnetic spectrum at different phenological stages. Understanding
    the single leaf’s spectral response and the processes that occur on this level
    allows to apply this knowledge to the canopy level (Hatfield et al., 2008). Spectral
    indexes allow for better information extraction from remotely sensed data because
    they reduce the effects of soil, view angle, and topography, while enhancing the
    focus on the desired extracted feature (e.g., the vegetation indexes enhance the
    visibility of the vegetation) (Hunt et al., 2012). Multitude of vegetation indexes
    (VI) were introduced in order to evaluate plant’s vigor and stress. While multiple
    VIs that use the ratio between the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral wavebands
    (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI),
    soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)) (Huete, 1988; Jordan, 1969; Rouse et al.,
    1973; Tucker, 1979) are successful in reducing atmospheric radiance and transmittance
    (Hunt et al., 2011; Tucker, 1979), the red wavelengths are strongly absorbed by
    chlorophyll and therefore are less sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content
    (Gitelson et al., 1996, 2005; Hunt et al., 2011; Yoder and Waring, 1994). As the
    leaf area index (LAI) increases, apparent canopy chlorophyll content also increases
    regardless of the single-level leaf chlorophyll content, therefore these VIs are
    much more affected by LAI than by changes in chlorophyll at the canopy scale (Daughtry
    et al., 2000; Eitel et al., 2009; Hunt et al., 2011). Since chlorophyll is vital
    for the photosynthesis process, changes in chlorophyll levels can be linked to
    photosynthetic productivity, developmental (phenological) stages, and plant stress.
    Chlorophyll levels also correlate to green vegetation nitrogen levels – nitrogen
    shortage reduces leaf chlorophyll content, thus decreasing plant spectral absorption
    especially in the blue and red wavelengths, therefore increasing reflectance in
    these wavelengths (Gitelson et al., 2005; Haboudane et al., 2004; Hatfield et
    al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2012; Yoder and Waring, 1994). Nitrogen is a vital plant
    nutrient, most important for crop growth and yield. On the other hand, the green
    wavelengths are more sensitive to high chlorophyll levels, since they are less
    absorbed by chlorophyll a and b, unlike the blue, red, and NIR wavelengths (Gitelson
    et al., 1996, 2005; Hunt et al., 2011; Yoder and Waring, 1994). Therefore, VIs
    using the green wavelength are capable of detecting changes in chlorophyll contents
    at the leaf and canopy scale and are suitable to monitor plants’ developmental
    stages and stress. Gitelson et al. (Gitelson et al., 2002) found that the NIR
    reflectance band is less sensitive for determining the vegetation cover (or vegetation
    fraction—VF) for VF > 60% and showed that a VI using the green–red–blue wavelengths
    have a linear relationship to VF, with an accuracy level of up to 90%. They showed
    that in wheat, when VF is between 50 and 100%, the green wavelength is most sensitive
    to changes in the vegetation cover (while the blue, red, and NIR wavelengths are
    insensitive to changes in the vegetation cover). Adamsen et al. (Adamsen et al.,
    1999) measured “Greenness” of wheat plants throughout the cropping season using
    a digital camera, a hand-held radiometer, and chlorophyll meter. They found that
    the green to red (G/R) spectral wavelengths ratio index is sensitive to the amount
    of greenness of the plant: it is less than 1 in the beginning and at the end of
    the growing season, and above 1 at midseason (Adamsen et al., 1999; Kanemasu,
    1974). The G/R index obtained from an uncalibrated digital camera was more sensitive
    to plant senescence than the chlorophyll meter, and on par with the NDVI index
    obtained from the hand-held radiometer, thus proving that moderate cost digital
    cameras can be used to monitor crop senescence (Adamsen et al., 1999). Kanemasu
    (Kanemasu, 1974) concluded that the G/R ratio may serve as a benchmark for crop
    growth, phenological stages, and for indicating the VF. Another VI that is based
    on the G/R ratio is the green-red vegetation index (GRVI) that is defined according
    to Eq. (1): (1) Motohka et al. (Motohka et al., 2010) evaluated the use of the
    GRVI as a phenological indicator. They concluded that the GRVI index can differentiate
    between green vegetation (index above 0), water and snow (index around 0), and
    soils (index below 0). Furthermore, they demonstrated that the GRVI (unlike the
    NDVI) is sensitive to leaf color change (leaf greening and autumn coloring). They
    suggested using the threshold of GRVI = 0 as a site-specific threshold for monitoring
    phenological changes and the GRVI index as an indicator for plant disturbances,
    and comparing between different ecosystem types (Motohka et al., 2010). Remote
    sensing for crop management aims at providing spatial and spectral information
    for crop classification, crop condition, yield forecast, and weed/disease detection
    and management. Current satellite-based remotely sensed products can cover large
    areas, but they are limited by both their temporal (revisit time – 2 and 5 days
    for Venus and Sentinel-2 satellites, respectively) and spatial (pixel size – 5–10 m
    for Venus and Sentinel-2, respectively) resolutions, when compared to unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV). One of satellite imaging’s challenges is dealing with pixels
    that have multiple objects with different spectral signatures (e.g., plants and
    soil). Such pixels are called mixed-pixels. UAV, imaging high spatial resolution,
    produces mixed-free pixels, therefore making vegetation detection and differentiation
    an easier task. Similarly, high spatial resolution allows for a precise estimation
    of the vegetation cover fraction. A basic method for irrigation scheduling is
    factoring the potential evapotranspiration (PET), computed from measured radiation,
    wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity, with a crop-specific coefficient
    (Kc)) as widely accepted and formulated by the FAO #56 publication (Testa et al.,
    2011). Crop coefficients are provided by diverse methods, such as empirical conclusions
    from field experiments, degree-day-based seasonal functions, experts’ recommendations,
    and the FAO #56 publication Kc library, or by field-specific measurements. According
    to the Penman-Monteith equation, solar radiation comprise about 85% of the evapotranspiration
    (ET) driving energy received by the crop canopy (Testa et al., 2011), and intercepted
    solar radiation is directly proportional to the light interception (LI) (Green
    et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2000; Meron et al., 1989). Further, since LI is
    directly proportional to crop canopy cover, Kc can be fitted to the field- and
    plot-specific dimension by measuring crop cover. Therefore, VF can be used as
    Kc. Aerial survey-derived VFs are directly proportional to cover, (Meron et al.,
    2006) thus digital aerial photography provides an efficient method for Kc determination
    (Campillo et al., 2008). Precision irrigation can be defined as matching water
    application to crops’ need in space, time and amount. Variable rate water application
    to achieve that is feasible with solid set systems using modern controllers and
    in variable rate center pivot or lateral move irrigation machines, all available
    in the open market. However, such application needs spatial and temporal crop
    water status information in sufficient resolution and accuracy, attainable mainly
    by aerial sensing and imagery (Haghverdi et al., 2015; Nahry et al., 2011; Zhang
    et al., 2011). Digital aerial photography became affordable and popularized with
    the appearance in the open market of low cost, high performance small sized unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAV) carrying high resolution digital cameras, in contrast with
    the former less accessible human flown aerial photography. Testing of these new
    enabling technologies for precision irrigation information acquisition is obviously
    needed. Such a technology is presented herein. The main objectives of this study
    were to test the ability of an inexpensive RGB camera mounted on an inexpensive
    UAV to determine vegetation cover and vigor of the canopy at a large-scale whole-field
    resolution and to investigate whether vegetation cover and vigor patterns can
    be utilized as indicators for irrigation water uniformity, and as such, feedback
    information for precision water application at variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    systems. Another objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of an RGB-
    based VI with that of the well-known NDVI, both in UAV-based high spatial resolution
    cameras and via satellite imaging. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. UAV imaging system
    DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter UAV was used as the flying platform. The UAV is equipped
    with a built-in RGB camera with a 4000 × 3000 pixel 4 K resolution CMOS sensor,
    a 20 mm (35 mm eq.) lens with field of view (FOV) of 94°, in a 3-axis stabilized
    gimbal (https://www.dji.com/phantom-4/info). The UAV was flown using Pix4D Capture
    pre-programmed flightpath control. The Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor was
    used in order to compare NDVI with GRVI. The Parrot Sequoia sensor consists of
    five downward-looking image sensors: a Visible 16 MegaPixel (MP) (RGB) with a
    definition of 4608 × 3456 pixels and four 1.2 MP: Green (550 nm), Red (660 nm),
    Red Edge (735 nm), and Near-infrared (790 nm) bands, 1280 × 960 pixels (https://www.parrot.com/business-solutions-us/parrot-professional/parrot-sequoia#parrot-sequoia-pix4d-precise-data-brings-accurate-analysis).
    The sensor was mounted on a DJI Mavic-Pro small-size, foldable-rotor quadcopter
    UAV. Sensors were factory pre-calibrated. Parrot Sequoia sensor was recalibrated
    before each campaign using a white balance reference target. Phantom 4 RGB sensor’s
    white balance setting was set to sunny. No other color or style enhancements were
    made to the obtained images. 2.2. Flight campaigns Flight campaigns were conducted
    in three test sites: the Gadot center pivot test site (33°2′22.91″ N, 35°38′0.43″
    E), the Havat Gadash field crops experimental farm (33°10′56.24″ N, 35°35′5.78″
    E), and the Hagoshrim lateral move test site (33°11′57.75″ N, 35°38′19.15″ E),
    all three located in the Upper Galilee region in the northern part of Israel.
    The area has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet, mild winters with
    mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 7 and 14 °C, respectively, and hot, dry
    summers with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 19 and 32 °C respectively.
    Annual winter rainfall is in the range of 400–600 mm, while summer crops utilize
    80–120 mm of winter soil water storage for the initial growth periods. At the
    Havat Gadash, peanuts cv Hanoch were sown on 1 May 2017 and irrigated uniformly
    by an experimental lateral move, starting on 8 May (Table 1). PET was calculated
    according to the Penman–Monteith formula, based on meteorological field data.
    Kc was calculated as cumulative irrigation divided by cumulative ET. Four differential
    irrigation treatments were performed starting on 19 July (Fig. 1). The Kc (70%)
    treatment yielded the highest crop weight per area (5.86 ton/hectare; more than
    0.7 ton/hectare compared to the rest of the treatments), implying optimal water
    application and water use, and was selected for ground truth validation – comparing
    field measured Kc with aerial imagery calculation of VF. Experimental plots were
    four 12 × 25 m plots, side by side in four replicates (Fig. 1). Seven flight campaigns
    were conducted at midday, at 10–50 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of
    0.006–0.02 m (Table 2). Crop cover did not reach full cover during the first two
    campaigns (25 June, 17 July). Full cover is reached when there are less than 20%
    pixels that are classified as bare soil. Table 1. Cumulative evapotranspiration

    pivot test site was cultivated with cotton crop, sown on 4 April 2017. The field
    was irrigated at eight-day intervals beginning from 3 June. Two flight campaigns
    were conducted on 5 July and 24 August, when the crop had already reached full
    cover. The flights were conducted at midday, at 50 m altitude and pixel spatial
    resolution of 0.02 m (Table 2). The field at the Hagoshrim lateral move test site
    was cultivated with cotton crop, sown on 1 1 March 2018. The field was irrigated
    at five-day intervals beginning from 24 May. Two flight campaigns were conducted
    on 17 and 26 June, when the crop had already reached full cover. The flights were
    conducted at midday, at 100 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0.043 m
    (Table 2). Flight courses were created with the Pix4Dcapture software, which was
    also used to automatically pilot the DJI Phantom 4 UAV according to the flight
    path. An overlap percentage of 70–80% was chosen in order to ease the task of
    mosaicking. In order to compare NDVI and GRVI, a flight campaign using the DJI
    Mavic-Pro UAV was conducted in the peanut field at the Havat Gadash experimental
    farm on October 10, 2017, twelve days before the end of the growing season (Table
    2). The Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor was used to create the NDVI, while
    the RGB camera was used to create the GRVI. 2.3. Data processing The images collected
    in each flight campaign were mosaicked and georeferenced using the Pix4Dmapper
    software. The ArcGIS 10.5 geo-referencing tools were used for fine adjustments.
    VF was calculated using ArcGIS 10.5, calculating the histogram of the GRVI products.
    Pixels with GRVI values greater than 0 were classified as vegetation, according
    to Motohka et al. (2010). Sentinel-2 Level-2 A atmospherically corrected images
    of the Gadot test site from 29 August 2017 were acquired courtesy of the Copernicus
    Open Access Hub. Venus satellite Level-1 radiometrically corrected and top-of-atmosphere
    reflectance images of the Hagoshrim test site from 17 June 2018 were acquired
    courtesy of CNES (French government space agency) ISA (Israeli space agency) and
    the scientific center at the Ben-Gurion University, Israel. Several VIs were created
    and compared to the UAV images, in order to check whether it is possible to use
    Sentinel-2 and Venus satellite imaging (with spatial resolution of 10 and 5 m,
    respectively) to determine irrigation uniformity issues. The following VIs were
    checked: NDVI (Tucker, 1979), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)
    (Gitelson et al., 1996), and GRVI (Motohka et al., 2010; Tucker, 1979). UAV images
    were compared to similar date satellites images for the sake of proper comparison
    (same day as Venus, and 4 days apart from Sentinel-2 imagery). All images taken
    with the DJI Phantom-4 UAV built in camera equipped with a gimbal assuring vertical
    nadir direction, were acquired close to midday (when the sun is close to zenith),
    taking images of flat agricultural surfaces, thus limiting bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) complication. Furthermore, at the height of UAV image
    acquisition (10–100 m) and for the purpose of analyzing RGB color space no special
    calibration or atmospheric correction was applied beyond the standard factory
    calibration. 3. Results 3.1. Havat Gadash experimental farm campaign The RGB images
    (Fig. 2A,C) have high spatial resolution (0.0066 m, see Table 2), allowing the
    differentiation of crop from soil. Negative GRVI values were classified as non-vegetation
    (i.e. soil), and positive GRVI values were classified as vegetation. The VFs determined
    according to the GRVI images'' histograms were 46% and 87% (Fig. 3A,B respectively):
    whereas, the VF can be determined as 1 minus the intersection value of the cumulative
    GRVI graph with the Y axis in Fig. 3, The field calculated Kc for the campaign
    dates (Table 1: highlighted Kcs) of 40% and 86% were in-par with the image calculated
    VFs of 46% and 87%, respectively, validating the VF calculations. Download : Download

    Fig. 3. Histogram of the GRVI images of the peanut field in Havat Gadash experimental
    farm on 25 June (A, 55 days from sowing) and on 17 July (B, 77 days from sowing).
    Cumulative values are presented on major Y-axis and histogram value are presented
    on secondary Y-axis. The GRVI images revealed crop phenological stages: whereas
    9% of the pixels’ GRVI values in the image taken 55 days from sowing were below
    zero and outside of the “soil curve” pixels group (Fig. 3A), only 3% of the pixels’
    GRVI were below zero and outside of the “soil curve” pixels group in the later
    image at 77 days from sowing (Fig. 3B). These pixels that don’t belong to either
    the soil or vegetation classified groups, were classified as non-vegetation pixels
    (due to their negative GRVI value), but could also be classified as vegetation
    in early phenological stages with G/R ratio values less than 1 (negative GRVI
    value yields G/R ratio below 1)—indicative of the beginning of the growing season.
    Furthermore, the “vegetation curve” in the later image is further away from the
    Y-axis compared to the chronologically earlier image (Fig. 3A,B) with higher positive
    GRVI values, indicative of healthy and vital vegetation suitable to the midseason
    phenological stage. As can be seen in Table 2 – crop cover reaches almost 100%
    (full cover) by the third flight campaign, but in later campaign there is a drop
    in VF. The reason behind this is due to pest damage (wild boars; see Fig. 1, bottom
    left corner). Images are not shown. 3.2. Comparison between NDVI and GRVI Since
    there were two different sensors measuring the NDVI and the GRVI (Section 2.3),
    the spatial resolution of the NDVI was lower (pixel size of 0.0373 m) than that
    of the GRVI (0.0095 m), thus enabling sharper GRVI imagery. The image was taken
    toward the end of the season, depicting plants in different stages of senescence.
    The RGB image was classified into specific classes (bare soil, dead vegetation,
    light green vegetation, dark green vegetation) using supervised classification
    aided by Image-Pro software (http://www.mediacy.com/imagepro) “Smart Segmentation”
    algorithm (Fig. 4B). Table 3 presents the total area for each defined class, for
    the classified RGB, GRVI and NDVI images. As seen in Table 3, the GRVI classification
    is more similar to the RGB classification, especially in detecting light and dark
    green vegetation, differentiating between healthy (dark green) and stressed (i.e.
    in senescence) plants (light green). As can be seen in Fig. 4, the GRVI captured
    plant senescence better than the NDVI: changes in plant color from green to yellow
    are depicted more accurately in the GRVI image than in the NDVI image. Greener
    vegetation (depicted in the RGB image Fig. 4A,B) has higher GRVI values (Fig.
    4C). On the other hand, the NDVI image (Fig. 4D) did not capture the color differences
    between plants that are visible in the RGB image (Fig. 4A,B). The NDVI values
    are very high for most pixels (0.81-0.92, Fig. 4D), indicating saturation of the
    NDVI values, probably due to high LAI values (Daughtry et al., 2000; Eitel et
    al., 2009; Hunt et al., 2011). It is probable that the differences in pixel resolution
    are also responsible for the accuracy differences. Regardless, for the purpose
    of vegetation classification and vigor analysis, the use of RGB VI is preferable
    to that of the NDVI. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    site campaign The images of the Gadot pivot irrigated cotton crop were taken after
    the crop had reached full canopy cover (Fig. 5A,C). A closer look at the GRVI
    images reveals “sector” lines, indicating differences in plant vigor (Fig. 5B,D).
    The “sector” patterns are indicative of ununiformed irrigation, due to intermittent
    pivot movement: the “greener” areas probably received more irrigation, due to
    lower pivot speed. This could have resulted from physical obstacles, uneven ground,
    malfunctioning pivot control, etc. Whereas these “sectors” are noticeably visible
    in the GRVI image, it is impossible to notice them in the RGB image. Therefore,
    using the GRVI in this case is crucial in order to detect irrigation uniformity,
    irrigation malfunctions, and other subtle disturbances. Download : Download high-res

    GNDVI images are pretty similar, showing high values homogenously throughout the
    whole field, except for the middle left corner (Fig. 6A,B). The GRVI image is
    more heterogeneous, showing patches of low values that are correlated to the UAV
    high-resolution GRVI image’s patches (Figs. 5D and 6 C), indicative of the field’s
    heterogeneous plant vigor and ununiformed irrigation. The GRVI is therefore better
    at presenting the real crop vigor situation. Whereas the saturation of red reflectance
    at intermediate to high chlorophyll values is well known (Gitelson et al., 2005;
    Kanemasu, 1974) and is typical of NDVI, it is surprising to see that the GNDVI
    was also saturated and did not show field’s heterogeneity. Download : Download

    The images of the irrigated cotton at the Hagoshrim lateral move irrigation system
    were taken after the crop had reached full canopy cover albeit it is possible
    to see within the field bare soil lines that were created due to the pivot’s wheels
    movement (Fig. 7C). A closer look at the GRVI images reveals lines, indicating
    differences in plant vigor (Fig. 7A,B). These patterns are indicators for ununiformed
    irrigation. There are both horizontal and vertical lines (Fig. 7A,B). The horizontal
    lines are indicative of intermittent pivot movement: Similar to the Gadot test
    site, the denser biomass (greener) areas probably received more irrigation, due
    to lower pivot speed. The vertical lines are indicative of differences in the
    amount of water delivered by the different sprinklers on board the pivot, and/or
    differences in the amount of overlap of irrigation between neighboring sprinklers.
    The heterogeneity in field’s plant vigor enhances as a function of time, indicative
    of an irrigation machine related persistent operation malfunction that is responsible
    for the ununiformed irrigation. On the practical level, such maps can be shown
    to the operator (and in fact has been shown) in order to readjust lateral water
    distribution of the machine, and to identify and remove obstacles in machine movement
    along the travel path. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    3.6. Venus satellite VI of the Hagoshrim test site Similarly to the findings of
    the Sentinel-2 satellite at the Gadot campaign (Fig. 6), the NDVI and GNDVI images
    of Venus satellite (Fig. 8A,B) are pretty similar, showing lower values of field
    variability, when compared to the GRVI image (Fig. 8C). The vertical lines can
    be seen in all images, albeit most clearly in the GRVI image. Horizontal lines
    cannot be identified in any of the compared VI. The GRVI image is more heterogeneous,
    showing patches of low values that are correlated to the UAV high-resolution GRVI
    image’s patches (Figs. 7A and 8 C). Therefore once more confirming that the GRVI
    is better than NDVI and GNDVI at presenting the real crop vigor situation. Download

    with the aid of UAVs as described in this research can support and validate farmer’s
    irrigation decision making process. Field irrigation depends on crop cover ratio,
    therefore up until the crop reaches full cover, it is necessary to re-evaluate
    crop cover at short time intervals in order to optimize irrigation water quantities.
    The technique proposed in this research offers an affordable and accurate solution.
    We propose conducting a UAV flight campaign a day before the scheduled irrigation
    in order to determine the current field’s crop cover ratio, thus aiding the farmer
    in determining crop specific coefficient. An aerial survey should be conducted
    for every irrigation zone. In case the zone is very big, it is possible to sample
    only some parts of the whole area, based on the field’s inherent heterogeneity
    (e.g. soil texture, soil type, soil water content, apparent soil electrical conductivity),
    and previous flight campaigns wherein crop cover heterogeneity was observed. Such
    sampling is beyond the scope of this paper, however it should be noted that the
    proposed techniques for crop cover estimation and crop heterogeneity detection
    can be integrated into other existing techniques that aim to improve the design
    of irrigation systems (Fortes et al., 2015). VRI systems can use crop cover ratio
    findings and heterogeneity in plant vigor in order to construct irrigation maps
    according to plants’ water demands and to better prescribe variable irrigation
    rates according to plant size and cover ratio. Even though much better, more accurate
    (and more expensive) sensors exist in the open market, we argue that for the purpose
    of determining crop cover ratio, utilizing affordable CMOS sensors such as were
    used in this research is adequate. Very high spatial resolution is paramount:
    it cancels the problem of mixed-pixels, and allows to obtain pure pixels of vegetation
    and bare soil, thus enabling to distinguish between bare soil and vegetation.
    It is possible to differentiate soil from crop cover using raw RGB images (Fig.
    2A,C). However, in order to quantify the ratio of crop cover to bare soil, it
    is necessary to classify these classes. Such a classification from RGB image is
    very complex, since there are 2563 options of color combinations for each pixel.
    Converting the RGB image into a vegetation index simplifies the classification
    task tremendously. As Motohka et al. (Motohka et al., 2010) concluded, the GRVI
    is very suitable for such a task, wherein GRVI index values of above zero can
    be classified as green vegetation (Figs. 2B,D, 3). Furthermore, as shown in the
    results, the GRVI was sensitive to differences in crop’s plant vigor, as expressed
    in chlorophyll composition and intensity, and in the number of pixels with negative,
    close to zero GRVI values at various phenological stages (Figs. 2,3), thus it
    could potentially be used in some crops as an indicator in determining phenological
    stages, and as a benchmark for phenological stages transitioning, such as senescence
    in groundnuts in this study. The GRVI also proved to be superior to the NDVI in
    detecting plant vigor, senescence, and irrigation uniformity (Fig. 4, Fig. 5,
    Fig. 6). Detecting irrigation water uniformity is crucial for the purpose of optimizing
    water use and crop yields. Our results demonstrate that specifically in pivot
    irrigation, it is possible to detect heterogeneity in plant vigor that are caused
    due to abnormal pivot movement. The “sectors” that are perpendicular to the pivot’s
    advancement direction, or horizontal lines in lateral moves, are indicative for
    slower pivot speed and over irrigation (Figs. 5,7); denser vegetation lines formed
    at the direction of the machine’s advancement (vertical lines) are indicative
    of inherent problems in the sprinkler system calibration: overwatering / under-watering;
    distance between sprinklers; sprinklers’ overlap due to the height of the sprinkler
    from the ground (Fig. 7). High spatial resolution UAV images are superior to the
    lower resolution satellite imaging in finding the “fine” lines that demarcate
    the field’s heterogeneity (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8): whereas some of the
    lines were identified by the satellites’ GRVI, it gave a rough idea towards understanding
    differences of plant vigor within the field’s scale. In order to further analyze
    the intricacies of the field’s heterogeneity it is necessary to get a closer look
    via UAV or other higher spatial resolution devices. Still, it was proven that
    satellite imaging can provide valuable information on large spatial scales regarding
    the field’s plant vigor heterogeneity that can be further investigated on finer
    scales upon demand. 5. Conclusions In this study, the ability of a high-resolution
    RGB imaging to determine vegetation cover and vigor at the canopy scale at whole-field
    resolution was evaluated, using an RGB VI, namely, the GRVI. It was concluded
    that the GRVI is suitable for determining vegetation cover, distinguishing between
    vegetation and other land covers (such as soil and dead vegetation, Fig. 2). The
    VF can be accurately measured and used by the farmer “on the spot” in order to
    directly define the Kc. It was also shown that the GRVI can be used to distinguish
    a plant’s phenological stages. In fact, detecting early season and senescence
    is easy with GRVI: a GRVI lower than 0 indicates low plant’s vigor, whereas a
    GRVI greater than zero, indicates strong plant vigor, corresponding to the mid-season
    plant phenological stage (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). It was also concluded that
    the GRVI is better than the NDVI and GNDVI in detecting subtle disturbances in
    mid-season (Fig. 6). High-resolution RGB imaging can be utilized to monitor the
    uniformity of irrigation water application and to detect heterogeneity in field
    irrigation (Fig. 5). Since both the camera and the UAV used in this research are
    inexpensive and available and the current auto-pilot UAV guiding technologies
    ease the use of UAVs, the presented tools should be available for “on-the-spot”
    farming decision-making processes involving precision irrigation and irrigation
    management. Author contributions Conceptualization, Assaf Chen and Moshe Meron;

    Location: Giza, Egypt SECTION I. Introduction Drought, issues with crop quality
    and production, and challenges with yield forecast [1] are just some of the issues
    that modern agriculture must contend with. According to United Nations'' Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, the global population will reach
    8 billion by 2025, an increase of three people per second (or 250,000 people per
    day), and rise to an estimated 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. Farmers need to drastically
    expand food production while protecting the environment and efficiently using
    natural resources to keep up with the growing global population. Still, they can
    not achieve this independently, and traditional farming methods are not equipped
    to handle the task. To that end, technological advancements are crucial in meeting
    the global population’s expanding dietary requirements. Farmers need to know how
    much water their crops will use, when that water will be used, and how much water
    will evaporate from the surface of lakes and dams for free [3]. The ultimate goal
    of smart irrigation management is to achieve efficient and effective water use,
    making it an increasingly significant administrative activity. Good irrigation
    management aims to apply the appropriate amount of water at the appropriate time.
    New and improved technologies are helping the vast majority of people in many
    different ways. The Internet of Things (IoT) and data analysis through machine
    learning [4] significantly enhance people’s ability to shape their environments
    in their daily lives. IoT and machine learning are widely used in the agro-industrial
    sector for diagnosing and managing smart irrigation systems, both of which supply
    crucial data for successful farming. Smart irrigation that efficiently uses water
    could benefit from IoT-based solutions, which have already proven useful in many
    areas of the agricultural environment [5]. An intelligent irrigation system must
    consider soil moisture, precipitation, and evaporation. A smart irrigation system
    is proposed in this paper, which would utilize machine learning algorithms and
    the IoT to conserve water and power. Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    rainfall are just some variables the system’s array of sensors may track. A machine
    learning system is fed data from these sensors about the crop moisture level to
    formulate an ideal irrigation schedule. In addition, the system incorporates IoT
    devices, which provide full transparency by enabling remote user control and system
    monitoring. The smart irrigation system is effective because it uses machine learning
    algorithms to analyze crop data in real time and predict plant development and
    harvest. The benefits of the smart irrigation system are discussed in this study
    as well, including decreased water consumption, increased crop production, decreased
    energy consumption, and decreased operational expenses. The rest of this paper
    is organized in the following manner. Section 2 reviews the related work and section
    3 presents the proposed methodology in detail. While section 4 presents the experimental
    evaluation, section 5 presents the system prototype. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in section 6. SECTION II. Related Work IoT, machine learning capabilities, data
    analytics and mining [6], and wireless technologies [7] contribute to developing
    smart agriculture management. Many works presented a lot of suggestions as well
    as several approaches to general agricultural activities that make use of this
    new technology. In [8], an overview of agricultural irrigation systems that use
    the Internet of Things is presented. In their literature study, the authors analyze
    wireless technologies, sensor nodes, and IoT systems alongside the most important
    indicators for characterizing water quality in irrigation, soil, and weather situations
    [9] and discuss the methods used to monitor and manage automated watering systems
    like sprinklers. In order to attain precision irrigation for increased food safety
    and water conservation, the authors offer new insights into how existing monitoring
    and advanced control systems might be developed. Critical agricultural applications
    are identified and examined, and the potential of IoT technology, practices, and
    future research are all explored in [10]. The research projects reviewed the state
    of the art in smart agriculture monitoring in both laboratory and field settings.
    In [11], a mathematical model was provided for corn tempering drying that considers
    the thermo-physical heterogeneity of the kernel’s components. In [12], an infrastructure
    for implementing smart irrigation systems was presented, utilizing LoRaWAN and
    fog computing. In order to determine when to irrigate, the proposed system exploited
    IoT nodes that communicate with nearby fog computing nodes and a distant cloud.
    No system has been proposed where data can be stored and tracked locally. According
    to the results of their analysis, cloud computing is more expensive. In [13],
    a Windows GUI program was described for multifractal analysis of soil and plant
    structures. In [14], a user-friendly smartphone app, REUTIVAR-App, was introduced
    for fertigation scheduling in olive trees with recycled water. Farm-scale irrigation
    and fertilization recommendations are also tracked daily in real-time as part
    of their research. However, the study did not focus on IoT uses. In proposing
    an IoT platform, the authors in [15] showed how to collect, analyze, and visualize
    sensor data for use in smart farming. In [16], a proposal was made for monitoring
    environmental parameters in chicken farms using inexpensive gear and software.
    Several experiments were also conducted to contrast the proposed prototype with
    existing commercial options. Intending to realize long-term and cost-effective
    monitoring, the authors in [17] proposed a soil environment monitoring system
    based on RFID sensors and LoRa for tracking soil’s temperature, moisture level,
    and chloride ion concentration. The authors of [18] present a method for recommending
    when and how much water should be used for irrigation by combining agglomerative
    clustering with machine learning methods like regression trees and support vector
    machines. The recommendation system did well on its collected data set and the
    publically available agricultural data set. The authors of [19] created an IoT
    and a data-driven irrigation system. Predictions of soil moisture content are
    performed using this method and compared to those made using alternative state-space
    models. Results show that the suggested strategy outperforms the status quo, and
    predictions for soil moisture content are positive. Since a water resource is
    most misused in irrigation, monitoring and controlling the agricultural field
    or irrigation are key factors to be met in an efficient, smart irrigation system
    [20]. The widespread availability of mobile phones makes this possibility possible.
    For off-site, real-time field data monitoring, an IoT-based strategy was developed
    and operated [21]. In [22], the authors proposed a system that used the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform based on the IoT to enable remote monitoring and control of the
    irrigation system. By allowing for remote monitoring and control, the system made
    the farmer’s job easier in terms of optimizing the irrigation system. Incorporating
    foresight utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence is a hot topic
    of study. Modern irrigation techniques are necessary to prevent water shortages
    [23]. The next section details the suggested methodology and the basic prerequisites
    needed to implement it. In order to predict the agronomist’s irrigation suggestions,
    this study [24] set out to establish a model that incorporates his irrigation
    planning process. Machine learning techniques applied to an integrated dataset
    from multiple sources allowed us to accomplish our goal. The dataset included
    agronomist-determined irrigation levels and sensor-based characteristics, weather-based
    features, and features describing plots. Three machine learning techniques, the
    standard linear regression, the nonparametric gradient boosted regression trees,
    and the nonparametric boosted trees classifiers, were used to build various irrigation
    recommendation prediction models utilizing this comprehensive dataset. Eight distinct
    feature subsets were used to train the models. Predicting agricultural yields
    and water availability using a hybrid of the wrapper feature selection methodology
    and the PART classification technique is offered [25], called WPART. There are
    four phases to the proposed system: the first is data collection, wherein environmental
    indicator data is gathered via the IoT system; the second is data preprocessing;
    the third is feature selection, wherein the wrapper feature selection approach
    is used to analyze environmental indicators and select the effective indicators
    of the farming system; and the fourth is drought prediction, wherein PART supervised
    machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the selected indicators. SECTION
    III. The Proposed System Architecture Figure 1 depicts the proposed system’s design.
    There are three phases: Data collection, ML model building, API integration, and
    irrigation scheduling. The watering scheduler is improved by the data fusion model
    used in the cloud service. The data model can be customized for various use cases
    by selecting and feeding in data from specialized domains of knowledge. In addition,
    the watering schedule may be monitored and adjusted remotely using a web interface.
    Fig. 1. The proposed system architecture Show All A. Data collection The smart
    irrigation system comprises various components for efficient data collection.
    Sensors such as a soil moisture sensor and a DH11 sensor for temperature and humidity
    air measurements are deployed in the field. These sensors are connected to an
    Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the central control unit. The microcontroller
    collects real-time data from the sensors, facilitating data processing and communication
    with other system components. A Node MCU is also utilized to establish an internet
    connection, enabling data transmission to the cloud. The collected sensor data,
    including soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity, is stored in a database
    server, providing a reliable and scalable solution for data management. B. ML
    model building Once the data is collected from the sensors and stored in the database
    server, it is transmitted to the cloud for processing and analysis. In the cloud-based
    environment, data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to ensure its optimal quality
    and relevance, a crucial step given the significance of smart irrigation systems.
    The initial phase involves addressing missing values, often a result of intermittent
    connectivity or sensor malfunctions. To achieve uniformity in the disparate measurements,
    data such as temperature and humidity are standardized using Min-Max scaling.
    Further, categorical variables, like soil types, undergo a transformation process
    called one-hot encoding, making them digestible for machines without implying
    any ordinal significance. A pivotal step in the preprocessing journey is the partitioning
    of data into training and test subsets. This division is paramount to avert overfitting,
    a situation where a model might excel on its training data but falter drastically
    with unfamiliar data. By training the model on one subset and testing it on an
    unseen one, a more realistic gauge of the model’s performance in real-world scenarios
    is achieved. Once preprocessed, the data is utilized to train a machine learning
    model hosted in the cloud, with the test data serving the purpose of model evaluation.
    The cloud platform also hosts an API for users to access system functionalities.
    It stores and manages the system’s data, ensuring scalability, reliability, and
    security. Additionally, it enables integration with other services and applications,
    acting as a centralized hub for data processing, analysis, and decision-making
    in the smart irrigation system. Once the collected sensor data goes through a
    comprehensive analysis process in the cloud platform, the smart irrigation system
    leverages the power of machine learning to ensure accurate and efficient irrigation
    decisions. A labeled dataset is then prepared, incorporating historical sensor
    data and corresponding irrigation procedures, providing valuable insights into
    when to activate or deactivate irrigation based on sensor readings. The machine
    learning model is trained to capture the intricate relationships between sensor
    readings and irrigation requirements using sophisticated machine learning algorithms
    such as decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), or logistic regression
    (LR). Once trained, the model is deployed in the cloud platform, enabling real-time
    inference for predicting optimal irrigation actions based on the learned patterns
    and relationships. This intelligent decision-making significantly improves water
    efficiency and empowers farmers with precise and timely irrigation strategies.
    C. API integration API integration is critical in enabling real-time decision-making
    for irrigation control in a smart irrigation system. By integrating machine learning
    models with a cloud server through APIs, the system can harness the power of data
    analysis and predictive algorithms to optimize irrigation operations. Users can
    retrieve sensor readings, watering recommendations, and system configurations
    through an API. It allows users to access real-time data, monitor sensor readings,
    configure irrigation settings, and switch between manual and automatic modes.
    The API provides a unified interface, enabling seamless integration with external
    services or applications. This integration allows users to interact with the system
    and make informed decisions. The API serves as a key component to share data,
    control the system, and facilitate smart irrigation system integration with other
    systems or applications. D. Irrigation scheduling The smart irrigation system
    works automatically by harnessing the power of machine learning. By integrating
    machine learning models with the system, it is automatically decides to pump or
    not without user intervention. In addition to its automatic capabilities, the
    smart irrigation system also provides manual control through an IoT cloud Arduino
    service, such as a web application. Users can access the web application interface,
    which allows them to monitor sensor readings, adjust irrigation settings, and
    manually control irrigation actions. By selecting the manual mode and using the
    web application, users can override the automatic irrigation decisions made by
    the machine learning models. They have the flexibility to customize irrigation
    parameters based on their preferences or specific crop needs. For instance, users
    can choose to activate or deactivate the irrigation system, adjust the watering
    duration, or set specific irrigation schedules. The manual control feature provides
    users with a higher level of control and adaptability, allowing them to fine-tune
    the irrigation process to suit their specific requirements or respond to unexpected
    environmental changes. SECTION IV. Results and discussions A. Dataset profiling
    The dataset consists of six attributes; CropType, CropDays, SoilMoisture, Temperature,
    Humidity, and Irrigation. The dataset attributes description is depicted in Table
    1. The dataset \"Crop Irrigation Scheduling,\" used in this work, was downloaded
    from Kaggle [26]. TABLE 1. The dataset attributes description Irrigation decisions
    are crucial in agriculture to ensure that crops receive the right amount of water
    at the right time. This attribute may contain data or actions related to irrigation
    management. These attributes collectively provide essential information for managing
    and optimizing crop cultivation, irrigation, and overall agricultural practices.
    They are valuable for making data-driven decisions in agriculture and optimizing
    crop yield and quality. B. Results When comparing the results of decision trees,
    logistic regression, and vector machine support models, their performance based
    on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are analyzed. The experimental evaluation
    method is the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 2 for the classifier decision tree,
    as an example. The mentioned evaluation measures are computed from the confusion
    matrix [27]. Fig. 2. The confusion matrix of the decision tree classifier Show
    All The values of computed evaluation measures, accuracy, precision, recall, and
    f1 score are depicted in Table 2. Table 2. The performance measures of different
    classification model Based on these comparisons, the DT model performs better
    overall, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-score for the results as shown
    in the Fig. 3. In the development of our smart irrigation system using IoT and
    machine learning techniques, the Decision Tree classifier played a pivotal role
    in decision-making processes, achieving the highest performance. While various
    training parameters can be adjusted to refine the performance of Decision Trees,
    for the scope of this study, we relied on the default parameters to ensure consistency
    and replicability. Specifically, the criterion for the quality of a split was
    set to \"gini\" which measures the impurity of the data, the maximum depth of
    the tree was left undefined allowing the tree to expand until all leaves are pure,
    the minimum samples split was set to 2, and the minimum samples leaf was set to
    1. By employing these default values, a foundational benchmark for the system’s
    performance is established, which can serve as a reference point for future iterations
    and optimizations. C. Comparison with literature This section presents and discusses
    a comparison with work in the literature that is related to our proposed method.
    In the realm of agri-tech, our work underscores the promise of combining IoT with
    machine learning. Iorliam et al. [28] tested various models on IoT-based irrigation
    data, where logistic regression reached 71.76% accuracy, and the support vector
    machine achieved 90.21%. Interestingly, our decision trees model’s 89.68% accuracy
    is nearly on par with their SVM results. Tas et al. [29] crafted a versatile,
    efficient irrigation system. Using sensors to track soil humidity, temperature,
    and rain, they tested several models. The KNN model was most impressive, with
    a 98.3% accuracy and 0.12 RMSE. Notably, their dataset differs from ours. Research
    [30] proposed an advanced Irrigation Water Quality Prediction (IWQP) model utilizing
    convolutional neural architectures. When stacked against Logistic Regression (LR),
    Support Vector Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), their approach
    leaned more towards traditional machine learning, aligning with low-capability
    IoT devices. Mishra and Somkunwar [31] advocated for logistic regression in smart
    irrigation, considering various parameters. In comparison, our various models,
    including logistic regression, could be marginally (0.0553%) more precise. Fig.
    3. The comparison between DT, SVM and LR Show All SECTION V. System Prototyping
    As shown in Fig. 4, a system prototype is presented that synergizes IoT technology
    and machine learning to optimize water usage and augment crop yield. By seamlessly
    integrating sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud connectivity, the prototype
    continuously monitors and analyzes environmental data to generate adaptive irrigation
    schedules. Through real-time decision-making and remote control functionality,
    the objective is to enhance sustainability and efficiency in agricultural practices.
    The prototype of the smart irrigation system was meticulously implemented in a
    small house garden, effectively demonstrating its practicality and efficacy within
    a confined space. The primary aim was to develop a compact and efficient system
    that could be effortlessly installed and operated by homeowners. The smart irrigation
    system comprised the following components: First: Hardware Components Microcontroller

    conditions, including temperature and humidity. These sensors provided essential
    information for determining optimal watering requirements based on prevailing
    weather conditions. Water Pump: A compact water pump was seamlessly integrated
    into the system to ensure efficient water delivery to the plants. Upon detecting
    the need for irrigation based on sensor readings, the microcontroller promptly
    activated the water pump to supply water to the garden. Power Supply: A consistent
    power supply was ensured to facilitate uninterrupted operation of the microcontroller
    and sensors. Second: Software Components Machine Learning Algorithms: The prototype
    harnessed advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively analyze sensor data
    and make accurate predictions and decisions regarding irrigation schedules. These
    algorithms were meticulously trained using historical data to discern irrigation
    patterns and optimize watering schedules based on the unique requirements of different
    crop types. Arduino IoT Cloud: The Arduino IoT Cloud platform served as the central
    hub for efficient data management and seamless system control. It empowered users
    with real-time monitoring capabilities, robust data storage, and remote access
    to system configurations through an intuitive user interface. API Integration:
    To enhance system flexibility and enable seamless interaction with external systems,
    we developed a custom API. This API facilitated effortless customization, scalability,
    and potential integration with other agricultural management systems. Its functionality
    included facilitating the retrieval of sensor readings, configuration of irrigation
    settings, and real-time interaction with the system. During the development of
    the prototype, we meticulously integrated the hardware and software components
    to create a cohesive and seamlessly functioning system. The microcontroller served
    as the intelligent core, effectively receiving data from the sensors and executing
    the irrigation control algorithm based on the trained machine learning models.
    IoT connectivity enabled robust communication between the microcontroller and
    the cloud platform, facilitating uninterrupted data transmission and remote access
    to the system. The software components, comprising machine learning algorithms
    and the Arduino IoT Cloud, worked synergistically to analyze sensor data, make
    real-time decisions, and provide users with a user-friendly interface for monitoring
    and controlling the irrigation system. The seamless integration of the hardware
    and software components ensured the smooth operation of the prototype. Sensor
    data collected by the hardware components served as critical input for the machine
    learning algorithms, which generated precise irrigation schedules tailored to
    the specific requirements of different crop types. The Arduino IoT Cloud platform
    facilitated real-time monitoring, data storage, and remote access, empowering
    users to interact with the system and make necessary adjustments as per their
    needs. The API integration further enhanced system flexibility and potential for
    integration with other agricultural management systems. Fig. 4. The prototype
    of the proposed system Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In conclusion, this research

    the support vector machine (0.8415) in this comparison of machine learning techniques''
    efficacy. In comparison to logistic regression and support vector machine techniques,
    the decision tree approach has a greater precision (0.0553 vs. 0.0454). The prototype

    1. Introduction In almost countries, the agriculture forms the backbone of the
    economic system and represents the main source of livelihood to a large number
    of the population. However, according to a recent report published by the Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (Fao, 2020), the world
    needs to produce more food in 2050 than it did in 2006. This estimation is mainly
    motivated by two reasons: first, the exponential increasing of the population
    number, estimated to reach billion by 2050, that requires to proportionally increasing
    the food production and having high yields in a limited time. Second, the agriculture
    is not limited to food production but constitutes the raw materials needed in
    various sectors such as poultry, medicine, industrials, etc. (Farooq et al., 2019,
    Farooq et al., 2020). Hence, to meet these demands, the integration of technologies
    in the agriculture operations is accelerating over the last years helping the
    farmer to decrease their costs, and increase their yields while avoiding unrealistic
    time and labor requirements. Recently, the emergence of the IoT is set to push
    the agriculture operations to the next level and it has been a driving force behind
    the increasing of the agriculture production at a lower cost. With the help of
    sensors, the IoT allows the farmers to get live data from anywhere about the environmental
    and field conditions then to make accurate and quick decisions about every operations
    of their work, from climate change to precision farming. For instance, with underground
    wireless soil sensors, the farmers can take better control over the process of
    irrigation and thus, enhance the water use efficiency. Therefore, the agriculture-based
    IoT solutions have gained a lot of attentions from agricultural companies and,
    as per recent reports (Farooq et al., 2019, Ummesalma et al., 2020), the market
    share is expected to reach billion in 2025 with more than 225 millions of connected
    devices. Indeed, such devices can monitor various kinds of agriculture applications
    such as water and nutrition, crop health, diseases and bug, machinery, etc. and
    help in several services such as irrigation, pesticides, fertilization, yield
    condition and storage, etc. Indeed, the agriculture-based IoT, more known as the
    smart agriculture, provides several challenges compared to the traditional ways.
    Particularly, the data management is considered as one of the most complicated
    tasks for decision makers in smart agriculture. From one hand, the huge number
    of deployed sensors required to monitor wide areas along with the continuous monitoring
    of the field conditions lead to a big amount of collected data. Such data are
    mostly redundant and contain useless information. In addition, the transmission
    of the whole collected data can quickly consume the energy of the sensors which
    are mostly equipped with small batteries. On the other hand, the big data collected
    in such networks will make difficult the data analysis process and decision-making
    made at the end user. In this paper, we propose an efficient mechanism called
    AGRO for smart sensing and decision-making dedicated to grid-based smart agriculture
    networks. AGRO aims to reduce the size of data transmitted in the network, conserve
    the sensor energy and provide a decision-making model for the end user to optimize
    the irrigation system. Subsequently, AGRO consists in three phases that represent
    the contribution of this study as follows: • The smart sensing phase that proposes
    a transmission model based on the soil type and the redundancy existing among
    the collected data in order to enhance the data transmission to the GL. • The
    energy saving phase that introduces a new sampling adaptation model allowing the
    sensor to adapt its sensing frequency according to the variation of the monitored
    field condition. • The decision-making phase that presents a decision model allowing
    the farmers to take a decision for each grid separately based on the aggregated
    data collected by all sensors in such grid. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows. Section 2 summarizes data reduction and decision making techniques
    proposed in the smart agriculture. In Section 3, we present the network architecture
    used in our mechanism. Sections 4 Smart sensing phase, 5 Energy saving phase,
    6 Decision-making phase describes the three phases proposed in AGRO. In Section
    7, we detail the simulation environment and discuss the obtained results. Finally,
    Section 8 concludes our paper and gives some perspectives. 2. Related Work Currently,
    researchers are focusing on data reduction, energy saving and decision-making
    approaches in order to handle big data generated in smart agriculture (Shamshiri
    et al., 2020, Khoa et al., 2019, Mekala and Viswanathan, 2019, Khanna and Kaur,
    2019). Subsequently, the objective of such approaches is to study the similarities
    among the collected data, eliminate the existing redundancy and deliver an useful
    information to the end user in order to take a suitable decision. The authors
    of Ayaz et al. (2019) present a survey about various sensor devices and communications
    technologies used in smart agriculture while the researchers on Jawad et al. (2017)
    give an overview about different energy efficient and decision-making techniques
    proposed in the literature in such domain. The authors of Pandiyaraju et al.,
    2020, Khelifi et al., 2020, Popescu et al., 2020, Bahi et al., 2012, Liang and
    Li, 2014, Keswani et al., 2019, Gómez et al., 2019, Haseeb et al., 2020, Keswani
    et al., 2019 are dedicated to reduce the size of data transmission at sensor level
    in order to save the energy and ensure a long time monitoring of the field zone.
    In Pandiyaraju et al. (2020), the authors propose an energy efficient routing
    protocol in order to provide data to the irrigation system. The proposed protocol
    works in three phases. The first phase aims to divide the monitored area into
    terrains. The second one selects a cluster-head for each terrain using the fuzzy
    rules adapted to the remaining sensor energies and the distance to the sink. The
    last phase aims to select a set of relay nodes to perform data transmission between
    nodes and sink. The authors of Khelifi et al. (2020) introduces a new atmospheric
    sensors for measuring air and soil moisture of an agricultural field. Then, a
    region-based routing algorithm is proposed that allows an efficient data collection
    from the sensors according to two metrics: residual energy and distance between
    nodes. In Popescu et al. (2020), a mechanism based on the collaboration between
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and sensor networks for crop monitoring in precision
    agriculture is proposed. The data collection scheme in the proposed mechanism
    is performing according to the following steps: first, a cluster-based scheme
    is proposed to group neighboring sensors into clusters and assign a cluster-head
    for each cluster. Second, a data aggregation method based on the minimum and maximum
    values extraction is applied at each sensor to reduce its data transmission to
    the CH. Third, a path planning strategy is designed to collect data from the CHs.
    The last step introduces an edge-fog-cloud computing algorithm to process data
    at the sink node. In Bahi et al. (2012), a two- level node mechanism is proposed
    that is dedicated to periodic sensor applications. First, the authors propose
    a local aggregation method to remove redundant data collected by the sensor. Then,
    an in-network data reduction called prefix frequency filtering (PFF) is introduced
    at the CH level. PFF allows CHs to find similarities between data collected by
    neighboring nodes in the same cluster, using Jaccard similarity function. Lastly,
    the authors of Liang and Li (2014) propose an efficient and robust compression
    method named Sequential Lossless Entropy Compression (S-LEC). S-LEC uses a differential
    predictor that arranges the alphabet of integer residues into a number of groups.
    For each group, two codes are assigned: entropy and binary codes. The first code
    specifies the group where the second one represents the index inside the group.
    The authors of Torres et al., 2020, Mekala and Viswanathan, 2020, Sekaran et al.,
    2020, dos Santos et al., 2019, Lavanya et al., 2020, Bu and Wang, 2019, Dewi and
    Chen, 2019 propose decision-making strategies to help farmers in the monitoring
    of their fields. In Campoverde et al. (2021), the authors introduce an IoT-based
    system that enable farmers to manage the irrigation process of their farms. Through
    a set of Raspberry PI and Arduino devices, the proposed system monitors the soil
    moisture and evapotranspiration parameters, and then the water control is performed
    via a decision model based on a reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Process.
    The authors of De Rango et al. (2019) propose a bio-inspired coordination protocol
    that integrates new technologies in the management of agriculture. Such new technologies
    include the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, flying Ad-Hoc Network as well as
    the sensors and actuators. The proposed protocol aims to manage and coordinate
    such new technologies with the goal to support the agriculture human operators.
    In Torres et al. (2020), the authors propose a multilevel data fusion architecture
    called Hydra composed of the three layers. The low-level phase that introduces
    a data fusion method at the sensor node; the medium-level phase that alerts the
    farmer about a set of predefined events when they occur and the high-level phase
    that uses a decision fusion technique for multiple data applications. Furthermore,
    Hydra is developed for two applications: soil moisture monitoring and plant water
    evaporation. The authors of Mekala and Viswanathan (2020) propose a decision-making
    system based on a selection sensor mechanism for monitoring soil temperature,
    humidity and air-and-water quality. First, the system defines the optimal number
    of sensors needed to monitor the zone then it introduces two methods, e.g. and
    agronomy function, to assess the plant growth and production yield rates respectively.
    In Sekaran et al. (2020), the authors propose a framework that integrates both
    IoT and cloud to increase the productivity of the crops in the agriculture fields.
    The framework provides a real-time analysis of the collected data placed in crops
    and helps the farmer to reduce its time and its energy when monitoring the crop
    growth. Lastly, an AgriPrediction framework, which combines between LoRa IoT technology
    and ARIMA prediction, is proposed in dos Santos et al. (2019). AgriPrediction
    builds a prediction engine that aims to avoid potential crop failure proactively
    and notify the farmer, through short and medium communication, for remedial actions
    as soon as possible. Indeed, the proposed works dedicated to smart agriculture
    are in increasing number and they mostly provide efficient solutions for various
    challenges existing in such domain. However, most of them suffer from several
    drawbacks: 1) the limitation, where a proposed technique is aiming to optimize
    one metric in such domain while negligent the other ones, which is not always
    valid. 2) The non-generalization, where a proposed method or model is dedicated
    to a specific application in agriculture and cannot be generalized to other ones.
    3) The complexity, which is not suitable to the limited resources of sensors.
    In this paper, a new energy-efficient and decision-making mechanism, called AGRO,
    is proposed. AGRO proposes a complete solution starting from the data collection
    and arriving to the decision making taken by the farmer. Subsequently, AGRO is
    a multi-layer mechanism and it relies on a set of algorithms and techniques to
    overcome the challenges at each layer. 3. Smart agriculture design system In Smart
    agriculture, the sensor deployment is the first fundamental operation before configuring
    the network. This can be done in a deterministic way, through human or robot,
    in case of small zones or in a random way, through aircraft or rocket, for wide
    agriculture areas (Tzounis et al., 2017). Then, after determining the sensor deployment
    mode, the network configuration process is starting by selecting the suitable
    architecture of network for the given application followed by the selection of
    the data collection model required to monitor the field condition. In the next
    sections, we detail the grid-based architecture and the periodic collection model
    adapted in our mechanism. 3.1. Grid-based architecture In our mechanism, we divide
    the entire agriculture field into small zones called grids where each grid contains
    a set of sensors to continuously monitoring the soil moisture inside the grid
    (Fig. 1). Depending on the field requirements, the farmer is responsible to determine
    each grid dimensions with the required number of deployed sensors. In addition,
    a grid-leader (GL) is assigned to each grid, which is responsible to collect data
    from all sensors inside the grid and send them toward the sink. In its turn, the
    sink forwards the data to a mobile application allowing the farmer to have knowledge
    about the situation of each grid. In case of a grid needed water, the farmer can
    operate the pomp to irrigate such grid through its digital valve. Consequently,
    the farmer can avoid the waste of water by irrigating the entire field. For the
    sake of simplicity, we assume, in our architecture, a single-hop communication
    between sensors-GLs and GLs/sink. In this work, ARGO works on several levels on
    the grid architecture, e.g. sensors, GLs, sink/mobile application. Download :

    architecture for smart agriculture network. 3.2. Periodic sensing model for field
    monitoring After selecting the network architecture, the sensor devices start
    to sense the target field and update the farmer about its actual situation. Indeed,
    we can generally distinguish between three types of data collection by the sensors:
    on-demand, event-driven and periodic-based (Harb et al., 2014). In this work,
    we are interested in the last type of data collection as one of the most used
    model in smart agriculture. In such model, the data are collected and sent to
    the farmer in periodic basis, which is suitable for most agriculture applications
    (Ibrahim et al., 2019). Mathematically, in periodic field monitoring, each period
    p is partitioned into time slots. At each slot t, each sensor node captures a
    new reading then it forms, at the end of p, a vector of readings as follows: .
    After that, the sensor will send its vector of data, e.g. , to its appropriate
    GL. For analysis purposes, we assume, in our mechanism, that the lifetime of each
    sensor is divided into a set of rounds, , where each round consists of a set of
    periods. 4. Smart sensing phase Indeed, the periodic sensing model leads to the
    problem of big data that affects the network in several ways, e.g. increasing
    the complexity study, consuming the network energy, routing overload, increasing
    the congestion, etc (Harb et al., 2017). In addition, such data are mostly redundant
    due to the spatial–temporal correlation existing in the agriculture applications.
    Therefore, in order to overcome these challenges, the amount of periodic data
    sent by each sensor to the GL should be locally reduced which can mostly done
    by eliminating the redundancies existing among the collected readings. The first
    phase in our mechanism, e.g. smart sensing phase, aims to reduce the size of reading
    set collected by each sensor before sending toward the GL. First, this phase defines
    a score table based on the soil types then it proposes an efficient model for
    data transmission between each sensor and its GL. 4.1. Score table The soil moisture
    readings collected by a sensor are highly dependent on the type of soil in which
    the sensor is implementing. In fact, the heavy soil needs more amount of water
    than light one but it can preserve the irrigated water more than the last second
    one. Generally, we distinguish between three types of soil types: clay, loam and
    sandy. Subsequently, the sandy soil is light, harsh, cozy and low in nutrients;
    clay soil is a heavy soil type, moist and cold in winter, dry out and warm in
    summer, high in nutrients; loam soil is a mixture of sand, silt and clay. Thus,
    in order to reduce the size of data sent from each sensor, we define a table,
    called score table, that is based on the characteristics of each soil type. The
    score table is a guide used to test the need of a plant to be irrigated depending
    on the soil type (Table 1). The table takes the soil type along with the soil
    moisture value then it determines the soil status regarding the level of irrigation
    (no need for irrigation, irrigation is needed, irrigation is a must). Subsequently,
    the soil moisture value is always in where more the value is closing to 100 less
    the soil is needing for water, and vice versa. For instance, if the soil moisture
    value recorded in a clay soil is between 80 and 100 then the soil is rich in water
    and does not need an irrigation at this moment. For the sake of simplicity, we
    replace the soil status by a score ranging in to explain the soil moisture irrigation
    level. Consequently, for each reading in , we calculate its score according to
    the score table then, we form a score set for as follows: . Table 1. Score table.
    Empty Cell Soil status Soil type no need for irrigation irrigation is needed irrigation
    is a must Clay Loam Sandy  Score 4.2. Data transmission model Based on the score
    table, we propose an efficient data transmission model that has two folds: first,
    it reduces the amount of periodic data sent from each sensor and, second, it ensures
    an updated information about the field status to the farmer. Our idea is to search
    the similarities among the successive soil moisture readings in then to only send
    those with different scores with the previous readings. Subsequently, the accuracy
    of the sent information can be maintained by defining a weight variable that indicates
    the number of successive readings with the same score. The Algorithm 1 shows the
    process of our transmission model applied periodically at each sensor. the algorithm
    takes the set of readings collected during a period and returns a reduced set
    of readings, e.g. , to send to the GL at the end of the period. The process starts
    by adding the first reading collected in the period with a weight of 1 to the
    set of final readings (lines 1- ). Then, the score of this reading is determined
    and they are both considered as the current reading and score respectively that
    will be compared to the next readings. After that, each reading in is compared
    to the current one and it is added to if and only if its score is different from
    the current one (lines 4- ). Otherwise, the field is considered in a stable status
    and the collected readings are removed from while adding the weight of the current
    reading by 1 (lines 10–12). Algorithm 1: Data Transmission Algorithm. Require:

    smart agriculture, the sensing, processing and transmission are the three main
    functions of each sensor. Regarding the energy consumption, the data transmission
    is the most costly operation in terms of consuming the sensor battery power, compared
    to other ones. Thus, in order to save the sensor energy and prolongs its lifetime,
    the sensor should reduce its data transmission to the GL. This can be done by
    minimizing the amount of collected data, e.g. reducing the period size ( ). In
    this phase, we propose an adaptive sampling model that allows the sensor to adjust
    its data collection according to the variation of the monitored field condition
    and the type of soil. Our model is based on the similarities among the readings
    collected during a round by using the Jaccard coefficient function. 5.1. Field
    dynamicity using Jaccard coefficient As mentioned before, the lifetime of a sensor
    is divided into a set of rounds, , where each round u consists of periods, e.g.
    . Thus, the sensor collects a set of reading sets in each round as follows: .
    Consequently, the set of scores sets correspond to is defined as , where corresponds
    to . Then, we search the similarities among the reading sets in each round, e.g.
    , using the Jaccard coefficient in order to study the dynamicity of the monitored
    field. Let first define the gravity of a score , where , during a period before
    calculating the similarity in according to the following equation: (1) where the
    gravity indicating the number of readings having the same score in a given period.
    After that, the field dynamicity during the round u is calculated based on the
    Jaccard coefficient (Jain et al., 2020) as follows: (2) where is the gravity of
    the score belongs to the set and always gives a value in . Then, we assess the
    field dynamicity according to the value of where we distinguish between three
    dynamicity levels. The first level indicates a high field dynamicity where the
    collected readings change quickly over the round; in such level, the value of
    can change in . The second level indicates a medium field dynamicity where changes
    in . The third level indicates a low dynamicity in which the fields changes slowly
    and resulting a high redundancy level among the collected data in the round; in
    such level, the value of varies in . 5.2. Adaptive sampling model In this section,
    we propose an adaptive sampling rate model that allows sensor to adapt its sensing
    frequency according to two parameters: the field dynamicity and the soil type.
    Subsequently, our model is based on the following rules: first, when a high similarity
    level among data is detected, the sensor must reduce its sensing frequency in
    order to avoid collecting redundant readings. Second, in case of high field dynamicity,
    the sensor should collect more data in order to avoid missed important information
    and keep update about the quick variation of the field. Consequently, the sensor
    maximizes its sampling rate and adapt it to the initial period size, e.g. . Third,
    the sampling rate of the sensor must take into account the soil type to calculate
    the new sensing frequency for the next round. Indeed, the type of soil plays a
    vital role in the soil moisture level and the field dynamicity. For instance,
    the sandy soil absorbs water at a rate of 2 inches per hour while the clay soil
    absorbs water at a rate of less than inch per hour and loam at a rate between
    and 2 inches per hour. Thus, the sandy soil drinks water more than the others
    while the clay soil maintain water more the other ones. The sampling adaptation
    table (abbreviated SAT as shown in Table 2) shows the decision made by the sensor
    to adapt its sampling rate. Subsequently, the new sensing frequency is determined
    according to three threshold coefficients and , where , related to the soil types,
    e.g. clay, loam and sandy respectively. The letters l and m indicate low and medium
    field dynamicity respectively where the coefficients are determined by the experts
    and take values in ; more the value is close to 0 more the sampling rate is minimized
    and more it is close to 1 the sampling rate is maximized. As mentioned before,
    the sensing frequency is adapted to the initial period size when a high field
    dynamicity is detected. Furthermore, the coefficient thresholds are customized
    by the experts depending on the application requirements with respecting to the
    following rules: and . Table 2. Sampling adaptation table (SAT). Empty Cell Field

    Algorithm 2 shows the sampling rate adaptation process, in the energy saving phase,
    applied at each sensor at the end of each round. Mainly, the algorithm takes the
    sets of readings collected during a round along with the soil type and initial
    period size then, it calculates the new sampling rate based on the SAT table.
    The process starts by calculating the gravity of scores in each reading set based
    on the Eq. 1 and adding to an empty set (lines 2- ). After that, the field dynamicity
    of the round is calculated based on the Eq. 2 (line 11). Finally, the new sampling
    rate is determined according to the SAT with giving the soil type and the calculated
    dynamicity (lines 12–13). Algorithm 2: Energy Saving Algorithm. Require: Node:

    phase The last phase in our mechanism allows the farmer to make a periodic decision
    regarding the irrigation or not of each grid on the field. Indeed, the decision-making
    phase works at two network sides: GL and sink. After receiving the reading sets
    from all sensors in each grid, the GL determines the criticality level of readings
    collected by each sensor then it sends it to the sink. Once the sink receives
    the criticalities of all sensors in the grid, it combines them in one information
    and sends, through a mobile application, a global decision for each grid to the
    farmer. In the next sections, we detail the criticality of each sensor at the
    GL and the grid decision-making model at the sink. 6.1. Criticality soil moisture
    level at GL Let assume that the GL receives the following reading sets at a period
    , where n is the number of sensors in that grid. Our objective is to determine
    the criticality level of soil moisture according to the readings collected by
    each sensor then, to send it to the sink for a later global grid decision. Thus,
    for each reading set collected by the sensor during a period p, the GL calculates
    the sensor criticality index, , of based on the weighted score average as follows:
    (3) where is the score of the reading and is its weight. Therefore, the GL classifies
    the sensor criticality index of a sensor into one of the following categories:
    • Low sensor criticality or : this indicates that all readings collected by the
    sensor are in the normal soil moisture range. • Moderate sensor criticality or
    : in this case, a variation in the monitored field is noticed but there is no
    need to immediate field irrigation. • High sensor criticality or : this indicates
    that the field enters in a critical situation and it needs a continuous monitoring
    from the farmer. • Extreme sensor criticality or : in this case, the field needs
    to an immediate irrigation or a waste in the plants could happen. Based on the
    above classification, the GL sends the ids for all sensors with their calculated
    criticalities to the sink at the end of each period. 6.2. Decision model at sink
    After receiving all the sensor criticalities at each period, the sink determines
    the suitable decision for each grid and it sends it to the farmer. Indeed, the
    decision-making model should take into account the criticalities of the whole
    soil moisture readings in the grid and not only a subset of them. This is because
    the sensors in the same grid having mostly different criticality levels thus,
    considering a subset of sensors may lead to a wrong decision. For instance, assume
    a grid containing five sensors where two of them indicating extreme criticality
    and the other ones collect low critical readings. Thus, if an irrigation decision
    is taken then this may lead to a waste in the water while, if the sink considers
    only the low critical sensors then a damage in the plants may occur. In our proposed
    model, we make a trade-off between the whole sensor criticalities in a grid and
    the water consumption. This is done by defining a new index called grid criticality
    that indicates the level of the soil moisture readings in the whole grid based
    on the criticalities of all sensors. Subsequently, the grid criticality can be
    calculated based on the following three steps: • The sink assigns a coefficient
    for each sensor criticality sent from the GL as follows: 0 for low, 1 for moderate,
    2 for high and 3 for extreme sensor criticality. • The weighted average for all
    sensor criticalities is calculated representing the grid criticality of a grid
    i, e.g. : (4) where is the number of sensors having low, moderate, high and extreme
    criticalities respectively. • The sink assigns a grid status based on the calculated
    grid criticality value as follows: (5) Then, we define a decision table that allows
    the sink to decide about the needed action regarding the irrigation process then
    alerts the farmer through a mobile notification. Table 3 presents the decision
    table proposed in our mechanism that takes into account three inputs: the soil
    type, the grid status and the irrigation index; the irrigation index is an agriculture
    indication used to measure the quantity of water, e.g. hour per inch, needed to
    irrigate a plant depending on the soil type. The irrigation index values shown
    in the decision table are almost fixed and determined by the agriculture engineers
    for each soil type. Therefore, based on the three input parameters, our mechanism
    decides the percentage of time needed to open the digital valve at each grid depending
    on the irrigation index values. However, in this work, the percentage values are
    fixed according to the soil characteristics but they can be customized depending
    on the application requirements. Table 3. Decision table. Empty Cell Soil type

    we used the real agriculture data collected by Agricultural Research Service (Brown,
    2017) and Brazilian Semiarid region (Zeri et al., 2020) in order to evaluate the
    performance of AGRO. Mainly, both data sets contain readings of soil moisture,
    volumetric water content and bulk electrical conductivity for a period times 2007
    to 2016 and 2015 to 2019 respectively. In the first dataset, data are collected
    through 42 sensors implemented in 42 locations at 5 different soil depths (between
    30 and 150 cm) across Cook Agronomy farm. Whilst, in the second dataset, data
    are collected via 360 nodes implemented in various locations in the Brazilian
    state with depths vary between to meter. Furthermore, the soil in the Cook Agronomy
    farm is mostly of loam type while the Brasilian state contains several soil types,
    particularly sandy and clay. Unfortunately, due to the missing values and the
    noisy data existing in both datasets, we tried to filter and clean the data before
    performing our simulations. Thus, the scenario adapted in the simulations is described
    as follows: • Data for 20 sensors are taken from the Cook farm, e.g. loam soil,
    and data collected by 40 sensors are taken from Brazilian state; 15 for sandy
    soil and 25 for clay soil. • The sensors are distributed into three grids as follows:
    the first grid contains 20 sensors deployed in a loam soil. The second grid contains
    15 sensors deployed in sandy soil. The third grid contains 25 sensors deployed
    in a clay soil. • Each sensor reads the data from its corresponding file then
    it sends to a base station considered as the grid-leader in our simulation. •
    The grid leaders are referenced as GLs, GLc and GLl for the soil types sandy,
    clay and loam respectively. • We compared our results to those obtained with PFF
    (Bahi et al., 2012) and S-LEC (Liang and Li, 2014). • The parameter values adapted
    in our simulations are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Simulation environment. Parameter

    readings collected by three random sensors corresponding to clay, loam and sandy
    soil respectively for the first 10 periods. The results show that the scores of
    sandy soil vary more than those obtained in loam and clay; this is due the sandy
    soil characteristics that absorbs the water faster than the other soil types.
    We also observe that, in clay and loam, the soil status is mostly varying between
    score 0 (no need for irrigation) and 1 (irrigation is needed) while few readings
    having score of 2 (irrigation is a must); this is because the farmers were irrigating
    the land in a regular periods without taking into account the soil status which
    leads to a waste in the water consumption. Download : Download high-res image

    In Fig. 4, we show the average percentage of readings sent from each sensor to
    the GL at each period in the three soil types. The obtained results are highly
    dependent on the period size along with the soil type. We show that AGRO outperforms
    PFF and S-LEC in terms of reducing the data transmission ratio from the sensor
    in all cases. Subsequently, it reduces up to and of transmitted data in clay,
    loam and sandy soils compared to PFF and up to and compared to S-LEC. Furthermore,
    the results of AGRO show the following observations: • The percentage of sent
    readings decreases with the increasing of the period size. This is because the
    variation of scores will reduce less than that of the number of collected readings
    in the long period. • The data transmission ratio in sandy soil is greater than
    those of clay and loam soils. This is due to the quick variation of soil moisture
    in sandy land that increases the number of sent readings to the GL, compared to
    other soil types (see Fig. 3) • AGRO gives better results than other techniques
    when the monitored condition varies slowly, e.g. the case of clay soil type. Download

    Data transmission ratio at each sensor. 7.3. Performance study of energy saving
    phase In this section, we study the performance of the energy saving phase proposed
    in our mechanism in terms of reducing the amount of data collection. Fig. 5 shows
    the data sensing ratio of each sensor in various soil types when varying the period
    and the round sizes. The obtained results show that the energy saving phase allows
    each sensor to significantly reduce its amount of data collected at each period;
    this confirms the behavior of AGRO in terms of removing the redundancy existing
    among the collected readings and allows to adapt the sampling rate to the variation
    of the field condition. Furthermore, the following observations are eminent: •
    The clay sensor collects less data than the others while the sandy sensor collects
    more data than the others. Subsequently, we observe that the sensor in clay soil
    collects less than of data compared to sensors in other soils. This is because
    the clay soil condition is slowly varying and contains a high level of data redundancy
    thus, the sensors reduces its sampling rate to avoid sending redundant information.
    Whilst, the sandy soil condition is quickly varying thus the sensor must collect
    more data in order to track the variation of the field status. • By decreasing
    the period size, the sensor collects less data in all soil types. This is because
    the similarities among readings in successive periods increase with the decreasing
    of the period size. • The data sensing ratio decreases with the increasing of
    round size. This is due to the similarity of Jaccard coefficient that decreases
    when increasing the number of compared sets. Download : Download high-res image

    sensor. On the other hand, Fig. 6 presents an illustrative example of the sampling
    rate adaptation for three random sensors in function of the round number progress.
    The obtained results confirm the observations made in Fig. 5 as follows: first,
    the sensing frequency of each sensor is dynamically adapted after each round in
    all soil types. Second, the sampling rate of clay soil (respectively sandy soil)
    is adapted less (respectively more) than the other ones due the high (respectively
    low) existing redundancy level. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download

    in function of the round progress, . 7.4. Performance study of decision-making
    phase In Fig. 7, we study the distribution of sensor criticalities determined
    by the GL nodes during 10 periods for all soil types. We fixed the period size
    to 100 readings and the round size to 2 periods. The results show that the soil
    moisture varies differently from one soil land to another. For instance, at the
    fifth period, most of the readings collected by the sensors in the sandy soil
    had high criticality while those in clay and loam had low and medium criticalities
    respectively. We can also observe that the sensors inside the same soil type may
    have different criticality levels at the same period. This may happen due to the
    large size of a grid or the artificial obstacles in some zones of the grid. Furthermore,
    the results show that a monitored field does not always need to irrigate when
    few critical readings are detected or a waste of the water consumption will occur.

    decision made at the sink node and sent to the farmer through a mobile application.
    The y-axis shows the grid status where and 3 indicate normal, significant and
    severe respectively (see Eq. 5). The results reveal the efficacy of the decision-making
    phase proposed in our mechanism in providing a suitable and real-time decision
    to the farmer. As expected, the figure shows almost similar decisions for clay
    and loam soils while a bit different is noticed for sandy soil. This is due to
    the rapid variation of the water absorption in sandy soil compared to other ones.
    Thus, the decision table proposed in AGRO will allow to reduce the water consumption
    then, to minimize the farm costs and resources. Download : Download high-res image

    of AGRO in terms of preserving the integrity of the information sent to the farmer.
    Indeed, the data accuracy is an important metric that should be studied in smart
    agriculture because it sometimes leads to a wrong decision thus, waste in water
    and resources. Fig. 9 shows the raw data collected by three sensors with the corresponding
    sent readings after applying the smart sensing phase. First, we observe that the
    readings are highly redundant where they vary in for clay soil, in for loam soil
    and in for sandy soil. Then, thanks to smart sensing phase, the sensor selects
    a few set of readings indicating the change on the reading scores, e.g. field
    status, in each period to send to the GLs. This can highly preserves the integrity
    of the sent information while reducing the data transmission at the same time.

    of agriculture tends to increase, the investment in smart agriculture will take
    more and more attentions from governments, companies and people in the next years.
    Thus, digitalizing the world of agriculture in a way that farmers will be able
    to use data in order to increase their production and make better-informed decisions
    will become one of the main concerns of researchers and industries. In this paper,
    we proposed a smart sensing and decision-making mechanism, called AGRO, that efficiently
    monitors the agriculture and helps the farmer in irrigating the field zones. Basically,
    AGRO divides the monitored field into grids then it presents three-phases mechanism;
    The smart sensing phase that aims to reduce the periodic amount of data transmitted
    by each sensor. The energy saving phase that allows to adapt the sensing frequency
    of each sensor according to the field dynamicity and the soil type. The decision-making
    phase which helps the farmer to make a decision for each grid according to a defined
    decision table. Through a set of simulations, we demonstrated the efficiency of
    our mechanism in terms of reducing the data transmission, saving the sensor energy
    and providing a suitable decisions compared to other proposed techniques. As future
    work, we have three main directions to enhance our mechanism. First, we seek to
    further reduce the data transmission in our mechanism by taking into account the
    spatio-temporal correlations among neighboring nodes and the remaining energies
    of the sensors. Second, we plan to add a scheduling strategy in order to switch
    some sensors in each grid into sleep mode so we can extend the lifetime of the
    sensors. Third, we seek to add a shift phase between successive transmissions
    of a sensor in order to reduce the congestion in the network and minimize the
    packet loss. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

- analysis: 'The paper entitled "Artificial Intelligence based Crop Recommendation
    System" by Jagadeeswari et al. provides an overview of an automated irrigation
    system that utilizes IoT and AI technologies to enhance crop management and increase
    agricultural productivity. While the paper does not directly address the specific
    point of "different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use," it provides some insights into the broader context
    of data collection and management within an automated irrigation system.


    The paper briefly mentions the use of various sensors to collect real-time data
    from the field, including temperature, humidity, moisture, pH, and water level
    sensors. These sensors provide valuable information about the environmental conditions
    and crop growth, allowing farmers to monitor crop health, adjust irrigation schedules,
    and make informed decisions. However, the paper does not delve deeply into the
    specific details of data collection, processing, and analysis, which are critical
    aspects of real-time irrigation management systems.


    Despite its limited focus on data collection and use, the paper touches upon the
    importance of integrating IoT and AI technologies in agriculture. It highlights
    the benefits of continuous crop sensing and monitoring, remote control of irrigation
    systems, and data-driven crop recommendations. These aspects are essential for
    advancing automated irrigation management and optimizing crop production.


    Overall, while the paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of data collection
    and use in automated irrigation systems, it offers a glimpse into the potential
    of IoT and AI in agriculture and highlights the need for further research and
    development in this area.'

    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction India is the 2nd most irrigated
    country in the world, with one third of the area is used for agriculture purposes.
    The main important agricultural input is irrigation, in a country like India which
    has extremely high monsoon climatic conditions, where rainfall is uncertain, unreliable
    and erratic. India cannot achieve sustained progress in agriculture unless and
    until quite half the cropped area is brought under assured irrigation. Irrigation
    of agricultural crops comprises 70% of world water use. The consequences of inadequate
    irrigation are affecting farmers'' ability to grow the food we all need. Increasingly
    volatile weather patterns and more extreme events such as floods and droughts
    can alter growth seasons, limit water supplies, breed weeds, pests and fungi,
    and reduce crop yields. I have. Erosion reduces the area available for agriculture,
    and loss of biodiversity affects crop pollination. At the same time, farmers need
    to save water and use less agricultural input. Smart Agriculture focuses on leveraging
    knowledge gained through a variety of sources (historical, geographical and instrumental)
    for farm management. The Intelligent System features the ability to record and
    output. Smart farming uses hardware and software to collect data and provide useful
    insights to manage all farm operations. Use parameters like soil moisture, environmental
    factors like temperature, humidity, etc. sensors, the system will react to any
    deviation from the optimal operating parameters and thus work to correct them
    by activating the pump which can then water the plants. When the desired conditions
    are achieved, the pumps are visited and switched. Decision making regarding crops
    also depends largely on soil information. The cloud technology helps in predicting
    what quiet crops are sown next by taking the stored input factors into consideration.
    SECTION II. Related Works M.Kalimuthu, P. Vaishnavi and M. Kishore (2020) implemented
    The proposed supervised system mastering the usage of naïve Bayes Gaussian classifier
    with boosting set of rules is advanced to expect the crop at excessive accuracy.
    In Naïve Bayes technique the accuracy of the version is 97%. In order to enhance
    the accuracy boosting technique is used. In boosting technique, the vulnerable
    rule has to locate and combine those policies to make it stronger. The vulnerable
    rule has been observed with the aid of using iterative process. The distribution
    taken with the aid of using base learner and allot identical weight to all observation.
    If any mistakes befell with the aid of using prediction of 1st Naïve Bayes base
    set of rules, then greater interest has to pay. Then subsequent Naïve Bayes base
    set of rules has to apply. Repeat step 2 till it offers better accuracy Thus,
    the seed is anticipated as an output for the given input parameter. This painting
    might also additionally substantially assist the needy farmers who''ve much less
    information in predicting the plants for growing a sustainable destiny. In destiny,
    it could also increase to signify the fertilizer, appropriate pointers for cropland,
    and plants for the given input. In addition, the source of daylight and crop fitness
    are monitored at regular durations and it''s also taken into the account for achieving
    a higher crop yield. Rithesh Kumar et.al., (2021) proposed Controlling tools and
    equipment with minimal time in data processing is critical in agricultural applications
    such as greenhouse monitoring. A second layer of fog computing provides on-farm
    data storage, security, and processing for speedier responses, such as smart irrigation
    and alarm systems. The farm''s big data sets necessitate ongoing study, and Big
    Data provides an analytical framework for identifying critical information for
    forecas t and application management. Sensor nodes are the heart of the sensing
    platform and are generally power-limited. Sensor nodes might have longer battery
    life and assist the grid by harvesting energy from ambient sources such as the
    sun, wind, and precipitation. Jing Zhang et.al., (2021) proposed Apart from precision
    agriculture, automation and AI applications, drones, lo T, robots, and big data
    are projected to play a major role in a variety of agricultural industries. The
    application of high-performance data-driven scalable learning methods improves
    real-time decision making and automates numerous agricultural operations, thereby
    changing traditional farm management into artificial intelligence systems. The
    domains of machine learning and sophisticated data mining are combining with readily
    available data sets and strategic frameworks to solve the difficulties of agricultural
    production sustainability, efficiency, and sustainability. climate change, and
    food security are all issues that need to be addressed. SECTION III. Existing
    Work The Internet of underground Things (IoT) has recently emerged the idea. Monitoring
    soil characteristics and weather conditions is important for plant growth. Like
    IoT, stands for Wireless internet sensors and to found underground monitor soil
    conditions such as moisture of the soil, nutrients content in the soil, acidity
    of the soil, pH level and electrical conductivity. The protection of important
    electrical equipment in wireless sensor nodes are challenging issues for IoT technology.
    Single-hop wireless UG sensor network has evolved into this IOUT technique. Plant
    Monitor is enabled with exceptional aerial imagery detected by thermal, multi-band,
    multi-spectral, light-detection and multi-focal ultra-precise (LIDAR) drones.
    This permits farmers to identify condition of the crop in field and plant diseases
    over better use of visual data statistics and precise location data using GPS
    dimensions. The use of drones in modern SAS uses thermal imaging, LIDAR, super-and
    multi-lens technology combined with advanced image processing software to process
    a wide variety of agricultural news. LIDAR technology is used to determine the
    predictability of the expected yield and problem areas of the crop. Since then,
    LIDAR has remained the most expensive technology, being able to obtain its 4,444
    homogenization parameters similar to the standard variation of culture index (NDVI)
    and water pressure index (CWSI). from aerial photographs obtained with super and
    multi-lens cameras Plant diseases, water stress, malnutrition, and insect infestation
    may all be predicted with the use of NDVI and CWSI factors. The neural network
    algorithm is a more advanced version of the machine learning algorithm, which
    is a training programme that employs structured data regarding sensor values and
    irrigation requirements. Setting system weights to perform output and total predicted
    input sensor readings is required during training. The activation function is
    employed in the system to develop a nonlinear model in order to prevent discovering
    inaccurate output values and to cope with scenarios that are not covered by the
    transmission line response alone. The test phase will use these mild loads to
    determine the system''s weights, which are set in the training phase. Quantity
    is required for installation depending on high irrigation demands. To get good
    results, these algorithms need a lot of training data. Particularly as the number
    of layers in the neural network grows, as does the complexity of the learning,
    which often necessitates the usage of expensive GPUs. They just created a tool
    that uploads RGB photos to a pre-trained, forwarded artificial neural network
    (ANN) network system to determine soil correctness. Figure 3.1 ANN network system
    Show All SECTION IV. Proposed System The proposed system includes technology IoT
    and AI. Using the IoT generation we can detect whether the crop has sufficient
    water and allows for controlling the irrigation machine for the crop with the
    usage of the Ph, temperature, and level sensors. Here we''ve got the irrigation
    machine of the crop running in three modes specifically manual, IoT, and sensor
    modes. In the guide mode, you may operate and control the drift of the water within
    the pump manually using the switch. In sensor mode, the water robotically begins
    flowing to the vegetation by the use of the temperature and Ph sensor. While the
    Ph value is less than 50 and the temperature is greater than 40 the water starts
    flowing into the field. In the IoT mode, an app is designed in this kind of way
    that someone can manage and modify the flow of water through a web server. Figure
    4.1 Block diagram of crop advisory system Show All The collected input parameters
    are then stored in a server using the cloud technology. The input parameters are
    then taken into account and the neural network algorithm is performed where the
    system automatically suggest the type of crop that can be grown in the field.
    The fig 4.1 is the block diagram for the project. The input parameters from the
    sensors are given to the microcontroller and then the instruction to on or off
    is passed in either of the three modes mentioned above accordingly the valve is
    opened or closed. The inputs are then stored in the cloud through an wi-fi module
    and then displayed using a LCD display. The same is then used for performing the
    algorithm in order to predict the type of crop for the suitable environment. The
    MLP neural network algorithm is performed where the dataset is collected. The
    outcome of this project can be viewed on the web server. The web server is password
    protected and one can create their personal login page by means of the signup
    option. As soon as we login to the web site the house web page presents the statistics
    like temperature, and the manage button to on and off the pump. One can also view
    the recorded history of the temperature, humidity, moisture, water stage and pH
    content along with the date and time. The graphic tablet in the web page shows
    the crops to be grown. One has to give the login credentials in order to access
    their webpage. The homepage consists of information like number of login time,
    weather conditions and so on. The user can monitor the temperature, moisture content
    (pH value), humidity and can view the suggested crops in the webpage. The webpage
    also stores the input values recorded each time by the sensors. In addition to
    that the irrigation is controlled by the webpage. SECTION V. Experimental Results

    Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction As the world''s population grows, so does the
    food shortage caused by a decline in agricultural crop production. It is mainly
    due to water scarcity which causes farmers to struggle to produce crops. This
    makes it hard to feed everyone in the growing population. Even in a country like
    India, where the climate is ideal for a wide range of agricultural crops, land
    and water are the most precious resources. Farmers are now required to use automation
    to produce crops due to this water scarcity. There is an increasing concern with
    water scarcity because groundwater is being used for everything from domestic,
    industrial, and ecologic purposes. The primary use of water for agriculture will
    be reduced if this much water is diverted to other purposes. An irrigation system,
    for example, is one of the methods of water management. It is a technique that
    ensures the production of a maximum quantity of crops, food grains, or commercial
    crops while conserving water resources. As traditional irrigation technologies
    do not utilise water in the most efficient manner, there is a significant amount
    of wasted water. Using water in its most efficient way would reduce the amount
    of water wasted. This will result in decrease in the amount of water required
    to produce such a large number of crops. Traditional irrigation methods for watering
    plants or crops have become outdated in recent years, mainly to the introduction
    of automated irrigation systems One of the benefits of renewable-based automated
    irrigation is that it reduces electricity costs by eliminating the need for lop-sided
    watering [2]. Another benefit is that plants receive adequate moisture without
    wasting water on the agricultural land [3]. In this work, an Internet of Things-based
    irrigation system is developed to automatically control the irrigation by providing
    the various sensor data with real-time parameters and controlling it remotely,
    incorporating SMS alert systems [4] [5]. Here humidity, temperature, and rain
    sensors are present to detect the weather conditions. To receive the actual moisture
    level of the soil required for the growth of various crops moisture sensor is
    used [6] [7]. In this system water through the tube reaches directly to the roots
    of the crops [8]. The objective of this research is to serve as a roadmap for
    an intelligent irrigation system that includes automated devices and data storage
    capacity that can be connected to the Internet of Things cloud. As part of the
    intelligent irrigation, a message warning system for the water pump on or off
    and even a water level alarm for the water tank is provided [9]. In addition,
    circuits for soil moisture, rain, and water level indicators are included [10].
    Fig. 1. Physical layout of the proposed system. Show All SECTION II. Literature
    Survey Drinkable and cultivable water is a scarce resource and it should not be
    wasted. The primary goal of this control and monitoring system based on Boltuino
    [11] is to eliminate excessive and irregular irrigation, power waste, as well
    as different crop-specific irrigation problems associated. This system provides
    a more precise response to the farm''s requirements. It is developed using a wireless
    sensor network [12], which allows each section of farmland to be covered by a
    different sensor module, allowing data to be transmitted to a central server and
    irrigation to be automated. In the year 2021 Md. R. H. Naeem et. al [13] designed
    a smart irrigation system using two different microcontrollers, Node-MCU and Arduino
    Uno based on IoT. The data will be collected and seen over an LCD display; individual
    websites also mobile. Based on the overall condition of Bangladesh weather the
    controller controls the water pump status and also controls on mobile. The systems,
    smart irrigation system can be effortlessly followed by the client utilizing the
    internet. M. B. Tephila et. al [14] in 2022, proposed an IoT-based Smart Irrigation
    System with various sensors which are automated. The proposed automated system
    makes smart irrigation integrated with a soil moisture sensor, temperature and
    humidity sensor, and a sensor that indicates the level of water, to collect sensor
    data and show the farmer to preserve water. This proposed system involves Node
    MCU as a microcontroller integrated with a Tensilica L106 RISC which is a 32-bit
    processor. Node MCU receives the input data and sends the output triggering pulse
    to the motor with respect to the program which was uploaded. The MATLAB platform
    is used to simulate and testing of the network life period and energy utilization
    at the nodes. This paper presents a smart irrigation system that is computerized
    and chip and keeps the health of the farmed harvests. S. Gnanavel et.al [15] this
    year published a paper about an IoT-based automated smart irrigation system using
    Arduino Uno and Soil Moisture Sensor. They use Arduino Uno as a microcontroller
    and soil moisture, water level sensor, and sink node. They work different values
    of soil moisture of various crops. when the value of soil''s moisture exists between
    a selective range of the crops, then watering start into the crop field and display
    the serial port of the Arduino IDE. The pump will off and on with respect to the
    extended data value of water within the field which is collected from the water
    level sensor. One smart irrigation system using IoT paper was published in 2017
    by Aman Kumar et. al [16]. In this paper soil moisture, rain sensor, and relay
    are connected with an ATmega328P microcontroller and unique, versatile device
    that is BOLT. The microcontroller is used for processing the data and BOLT is
    used to show the graph value of the soil moisture. For controlling the motor manually,
    they can create an HTML page and use the API technique of the BOLT device. They
    work in the automation of irrigation systems and irrigation at remote locations
    i.e., from home. SECTION III. Operation, Block Diagram and Circuit Connection
    This weather adaptive cognitive irrigation system formation of various weather
    detected sensors (soil moisture, rain sensor, water level indication sensor, DHT11,
    LDR), water pump, relay, solar panel, OLED. Arduino Uno and BOLT module is used
    for process, control, and data display, and are stored in the cloud. Arduino Uno
    collects data from soil moisture, LDR, water level, and rain sensor which is connected
    with Arduino Uno analog pin A0, A1, A2, and A3 respectively. OLED display SDK
    and SCl pin are connected with Arduino Uno pins A4 and A5. DHT 11 pin is connected
    with Arduino digital pin 2. BOLT module is communicated with Arduino Uno through
    serial communication. BOLT module RX and TX pin is connected with Arduino Uno
    digital pin 8 and 9. Also, the water level indicator sensor data pin and pump
    relay signal pin are connected with BOLT module analog pin A0 and digital pin
    4 to send an alert message when the water tank is empty and pump on/off status.
    The block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 3. All the sensors and relay
    are powered by Arduino 5 Volt, and the water pump is powered by a solar panel
    which is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 2. Flowchart of the operation. Show All Fig. 3.
    Block diagram of the proposed system Show All At first Arduino Uno collects the
    data from the soil moisture sensor and checks the data whether it matches or maximum
    or minimum the threshold value if it''s minimum Arduino sends a high pulse to
    the relay where the water pump Is connected and the motor will start, after that
    when soil moisture data is maximum the threshold the motor will stop again Arduino
    check the rain sensor value if the data is high it means if the rain start and
    crosses the data which we set the Arduino will send a low pulse to the relay,
    and the pump will stop again Arduino check the water level indication sensor and
    if the sensor data cross the threshold value it means when the water tank is empty
    then Arduino send the low pulse to the relay and pump will stop, also Arduino
    collects the LDR sensor data and match its threshold value. When crossingthe threshold
    value, it means at the night when low light intensity falls on the surface of
    LDR the LED which is connected to the Arduino Uno digital pin 10 will ON similarly
    when intensity is high the LED will turn OFF. The water pump is ON/ OFF and the
    status of the motor also soil moisture percentage value is showing in the OLED
    display on the ground. Table I. Pump on and off status threshold value All the
    data will send to the BOLT cloud when the BOLT module will request the data to
    Arduino, and it send through serial communication to the BOLT after that it processes
    the data and showing in the internet-based platform through line graphs or various
    forms. also, BOLT checks the water level sensor data and matches the data set
    to the program, when the tank is empty BOLT sends the SMS alert to the operator''s
    mobile phone. Every time when the pump starts or stops the operator gets a massage
    as shown in Fig. 9. The soil moisture percentage, humidity, and temperature data
    can be monitored and start or stop of the water pump can be possible remotely
    by pressing the buttons Pump ON and Pump OFF on the BOLT cloud platform. Fig.
    4. Power connection block diagram of the proposed system. Show All SECTION IV.
    Hardware Architecture A. Bolt Module BOLT device is an IoT controller module based
    on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chipset [4] [17]. Its speciality is program- based cloud
    computing. It has an A0 pin which is used for receiving or sending data to analog
    sensor, for a digital sensor or digital component it has 5 digital input/output
    pin that is 0 to 4, and it has 2 powers pin which is 3.3-volt 5 volts, and GND
    pin, also it has RX and TX pin for communicating any other controller through
    receive or send data through serial communication [18]. Fig. 5. Circuit & connection
    diagram of the proposed system Show All For programable ability it is used for
    data processing, output plotting of any sensor, send an alert message. In our
    prototype BOLT use to show data on the BOLT cloud platform through the graph,
    remotely control the main circuit and use it for sending messages to the farmer.
    B. Arduino Uno Arduino Uno is a handy, easy-to-use, open to all microcontroller,
    which has an ATmega328P microcontroller [11], it has 6 analog pins for analog
    and 14 I/O pins for digital (6 of them are used for PWM outputs) connection. It
    has a 5 Volt operating voltage. Using Arduino Software (IDE) we can program the
    Arduino Uno. To power the Arduino Uno board, we have to use a USB connection or
    an external power supply and it selects the power source automatically. Arduino
    Uno has capable to connect and communicate with another Arduino board, computer,
    or other microcontrollers. It uses digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) for serial communication
    with another device. Using the serial software library, any digital pin for serial
    communication can be used. C. Soil Moisture Sensor The soil moisture sensor is
    a pretty straightforward system for sensing the moisture level in soil and comparable
    materials [19]. It has two parts; one is the probe another is the module. The
    probe with two uncovered conductors which are fork-shaped acts as a variable resistor
    whose resistance changes depending on the water content in the soil. The soil
    moisture is inversely proportional to the resistance of the prob. Moisture level
    can be defined from the output voltage according to the resistor of the prob which
    is produced by the sensor. It has 4 pins that are VCC, GND, and D0 which are for
    digital output [20], and the A0 pin is for analog output. Arduino Uno collects
    data from A0 for process and sends it to the BOLT. The water pump will start or
    stop depending on the soil moisture sensor value [21]. D. Ldr Sensor An LDR (light-dependent
    resistor) is called a photoresistor. When light falls on the surface area of the
    LDR the resistor of the LDR changes and the change of resistance depends on the
    amount of light falling [17]. In this system, LDR is interfaced with Arduino Uno
    Al pin and it is used to detect the light intensity of the surround. At night
    time Arduino Uno sends a signal to turn on the light of the crops field when the
    microcontroller gets the LDR data and is below the threshold. Fig. 6. Led on and
    off depending on ldr sensor value. Rain sensor Show All Fig. 7. Actual prototype
    of the proposed system Show All The sensor resistance is inversely proportional
    to the waterThe rain sensor senses the rainfall and sends the data to the Arduino
    Uno [11]. It has two parts one is the sensing pad another is the module. It has
    4 pins that are A0 (Analog output), D0 (Digital output), VCC, and GND. The surface
    of the sensing pad has a series of exposed copper traces and works as a changeable
    resistor whose resistance change according to the amount of water on the sensing
    pad. The rainfall on the pad is propositional to the resistance of the pad. Arduino
    Uno collects the data from the analog pin A3 of the Arduino board. On the basis
    of the data, the pump relay will be ON and OFF. E. Water Level Sensor A water
    Level Sensor is used to measure the level of water in the water tank or any water
    container. The series of the disclosed conductors work as a variable resistor
    and their resistance changes according to the water level in the tank level in
    the tank [22]. It has 3 pin S for signal VCC and GND, the signal pin is connected
    with Arduino Uno analog pin A2 and also connects to analog pin A0 of the BOLT
    module. F. Dht 11 Sensor DHT 11 sensor is used to measure the humidity and temperature
    of the surrounding environment [12]. It has a thermistor and humidity measuring
    component inside. It has VCC, OUT and GND pins, OUT is a digital data pin that
    is connected with Arduino Uno digital I/O pin 2. BOLT shows the temperature and
    humidity from of graph to the BIoT platform. G. Oled Display OLED displays are
    very light, very thin, hypothetically malleable, and getting brighter and crisper
    picture Organic Light-Emitting Diode displays. The display is used in this system
    to show the Soil moisture and motor status. The 4 pinsare VCC, GND, SCL, and SDK,
    SCL pins are connected with analog pin A5, and SDK is connected with pin A4 of
    the Arduino Uno. Fig. 8. Display the sensor value and pump status on oled. Show
    All H. Relay A device which is work as an electromagnetic switch and is operated
    with less current and controls a large current is called a relay. Relays are different
    types like single-channel, dual-channel, etc. here single channel relay is used
    in this prototype. The relay has 5 pins on two sides. One side VCC, GND, and IN,
    another side pin is COM, NC, NO. IN pin is used to control the relay [20]. When
    the pin signal is LOW the relay will be active and when HIGH the relay will become
    inactive. For the signal which we use to switch you need to connect the COM pin.
    NC is normally connected pin and it is automatic connect with the COM pin unlace
    you send the HIGH signal to IN pin. NO pin is open by default, when you send a
    signal to the relay IN pin it will make a connection with the COM (common) pin.
    In this system, two relays were used one for controlling the pump another to connect
    and disconnect the motor remotely through the BOLT cloud platform. The relay is
    used for on or off the water pump automatically [24]. SECTION V. Result The controller
    senses the soil sensor value and if it is maximum the threshold value the pump
    is off condition. When the soil moisture percentage reached the minimum threshold
    value the pump is start and also sends the pump on and pump off SMS alert to the
    mobile [5] Similarly when the rain starts pump will stop. LDR is used to trigger
    the LED bulb when the LDR value is low which means it is dark or night time the
    LED will glow, also the water level sensor crosses the threshold value the pump
    will stop and also send an SMS [17] that “Water tank empty”. Line graph showing
    in BOLT cloud platform also Soil moisture percentage and pump running condition
    is shown in OLED screen. Fig. 9. Csv data collect from bolt iot platform. Show
    All On the BOLT IoT cloud platform, both historical and real-time sensor data
    can be retrieved in CSV or PDF format. Since the information is readily available,
    an informed decision may be made based on the soil''s moisture, humidity, precipitation,
    and temperature. Consequently, the crops flourish under regulatory monitoring
    of the farmer. Fig. 10. Line graph obtain from bolt iot cloud platform Show All
    Fig. 11. Sms alert on mobile. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion The proposed system
    is having the capability of monitoring agricultural parameter. Where the user
    can easily monitor different farming data of the agricultural land through the
    help of internet. The sensor in the system provides accurate information to the
    smartphone, computer, and various internet connecting devices based on crop needs.
    The proposed model will increase agriculture productivity due to the use of a
    cognitive irrigation process. This system provides a real- time monitoring setup
    that helps the farmer to monitor various agricultural parameters 24/7 with the
    help of sensors and takes necessary action according to the environment which
    lowers the labor cost and effective use of water for irrigation by hassle-free
    operation. Here all the data are collected from an indoor farming arrangement
    through multiple sensors. The sensor provides details of soil moisture, light,
    humidity, rain, and temperature. Through this proposed framework, farmers might
    become more aware of current technological advances and perhaps the most straightforward
    method of agricultural production. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction The irrigation process helps to distribute
    water efficiently in agriculture field and also to reduce wastage of water. Farmers
    have to face erratic rainfall which affects the food production so it will hampers
    the socioeconomic condition of farmer. This has been reflected from increasing
    rate of suicide of the farmers. This is also due to beware of improved farming
    and irrigation techniques and water sources. So there socioeconomic condition
    is very poor. Hence there is a need of technology for water requirement prediction
    according to the crop and soil. To increase the farming productivity, profitability
    and efficiency wireless sensor-based implementation with machine learning helps
    to increase the crop yield in adequate amount of water. The traditional irrigation
    process causes wastage of the water and electricity. Poor irrigation management
    practice can result in over irrigation or under irrigation problems which decreases
    the crop yield, damaging crops, nutrient uptake and decrease aeration. [13] To
    maintain soil moisture level improved irrigation system is required. Improved
    irrigation which implies automated water distribution system for the plants. The
    water pump motor is automatically turn ON and OFF by considering the present temperature,
    humidity and soil moisture. The proposed study is to develop automatic irrigation
    system and trying to take more accurate decision for it. This system performs
    the task of monitoring and controlling automatic irrigation process. [14] A. IOT
    Based Improved Irrigation System IoT is a challenging field of computer science
    it represents smart data generation and processing. Using sensors and microcontroller,
    scheduling of scientific implementation can be possible for supplying measured
    quantity of water in required time. The sensor data can be used as an input to
    the microcontroller. Microcontroller can control and monitor irrigation process.
    In Internet of Thing (IoT) based system, devices can communicate through core
    Network, the sensor used to capture data. For implementation and communication
    of the devices Arduino Uno, Rasberry Pi3 kind of technologies can be used. B.
    Machine Learning for Improved Irrigation System Machine learning is the subfield
    of Artificial Intelligence and computer science. It provides a data analytic technique
    and model can be generate by using algorithm to learn information from the data.
    Machine learning is applicable for scheduling the irrigation process with different
    tools and predictive model. It can be implemented in automated irrigation system
    by considering soil moisture content of field and some other real time environmental
    parameters. The real time parameters help to provide correct decision for effective
    agriculture process. (17) SECTION II. Literature Review There are many modern
    techniques have been proposed for water management in agriculture: Todkari G.
    U. (2012) mentioned in the paper that irrigation is the primary determinant of
    agriculture as its inadequacies are most important constraint of increasing agricultural
    crop production. The author specify some suggestions to the individual, institutional
    and administrative level like to achieve innovative method and technology for
    water management need to carry research work, micro level projects needs to implement
    for major benefits, Think globally act locally for proper water management, from
    co-operative sector funds needs to raise in district level and so on. [1] Peace
    Muyambo (2019), designed and developed mobile application for monitoring and controlling
    irrigation system automatically using Arduino, microcontroler ESP8266 and basic
    sensors. Author wants to improve his system by adding the provision for setting
    soil moisture range through user interface. Also, the system can improve by adding
    some intelligence for analyzing the dataset train the machine to take accurate
    decision. [2] Dr. Santosh Jagtap et. al (2021), Machine learning provide various
    applications to analyzing the data sophisticatedly and helps to take more accurate
    decision, increasing efficiency in agriculture. Applicability of machine learning
    in agriculture is describe by the authors. [3] Mrs. S. Sangeetha et. al. (2017),
    Using different sensors and cloud computing, auto plant watering and fire identification
    system is developed. Such technologies helps to make improvement in agriculture.
    [4] Kizito Masaba et. al. (2016), introduced an approach that decentralizes monitoring
    and decision making in farm irrigation. [5] Yu-chuan chang et. al. (2019), LoRa
    P2P networks used for smart irrigation system and Machine Learning used for accuracy.
    At initial stage water amount is calculated for irrigation with the help of trained
    irrigation model and environmental data. [6] Ashwini B. V (2018), developed android
    based mobile application for smart irrigation process with microcontroller, sensors
    and Bluetooth. Different sensors are used to collect the data and that data will
    compare with threshold values. The Arduino Board used to connect the sensors.
    The switching of pump ON or OFF is on the basis of soil moisture value. [7] R.
    N. Kirtan (2018), developed two modules, Sensor module and Prediction module.
    The sensor module measured the sensor data and Zigbee helps to transmit this data
    over base station. In base station module the prediction model is developed with
    the help of Raspberry Pi computing platform and Machine Learning algorithm. For
    automated irrigation process the classification problem is illustrated in this
    study. [8] Amarendra Goap el. at. (2019), to perform soil moisture prediction,
    machine learning techniques are used and the sensor-based data is collected from
    weather forecast and field. After analyzing all these techniques GBRT gives more
    encouraging result for soil moisture prediction. [9] SECTION III. Proposed System
    Model The proposed IoT based auto Irrigation system build using basic sensors
    and wireless sensor network. The development architectural model of the proposed
    study is shown in Fig. 1. Soil moisture is the most important parameter of irrigation
    process, less or excess water affect on the crop growth, diseases and water wastage.
    Similarly present environmental temperature and humidity helps to take accurate
    decision for irrigation process. The study is divided in to 6 components (Fig.
    2.). Fig. 1. Developed architectural model of project Show All Fig. 2. Schematic
    architectural Show All SECTION IV. Sensors Installation and Circuit Establishment
    The circuit build with sensors, relay switch, web service and water motor. The
    sensors are placed appropriately and connected to the Microcontroller ESP8266
    with jumper wires. To check the real time data values the web-based interface
    is developed using PHP programming language. The minimum and maximum soil moisture
    level can set through user interface. Soil moisture requirement depend on crop
    age and crop type. It will help to start and stop the irrigation process. The
    small DC 3–6 V mini submersible water motor is used for irrigation process. Motor
    ON/OFF process has been done automatically by considering present soil moisture
    level. If the present soil moisture level is less than scheduled minimum soil
    moisture level then water motor will get start and once it will reach to the scheduled
    maximum soil moisture level motor will get stop. Internet Wi-Fi connection is
    essential for data collection, monitoring and also for auto irrigation process.
    For scheduling and monitoring the irrigation process user interface is developed
    using PHP and MySQL. This web based interface helps to monitor real time data
    and real time water motor state. Water motor is connected to relay switch and
    web service to turn it ON and OFF. Through user interface water motor can operate
    manually and automatically also. A. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor This
    is good quality and low-cost environmental humidity and temperature sensor. Power
    consumption is also low and having long term stability. The temperature range
    is O''c to 50''c and humidity range is 20% to 80%. The value of temperature and
    humidity read by microcontroller and microcontroller send it over web service
    for irrigation process. B. Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2.0 To measure soil
    moisture content from the crop root surface Capacitive Soil moisture sensor is
    used. There are multiple types of soil moisture sensors available in the market,
    here we used capacitive moisture sensor which measures moisture level from soil
    by capacitive sensing. This is very less expensive moisture sensor with high reliability.
    The range of this sensor is 0 to 1023. Fig. 3. Experimental model setup (auto
    irrigation system prototype). Show All C. Data Collection Microcontroller ESP8266
    read present data from soil moisture sensor, Temperature and Humidity sensor.
    The programming is done in Micro Python to get data in each 15 minutes time interval.
    The ESP microcontroller send sensor data to the server. Soil moisture, temperature
    and humidity values are stored with date and time for 20 days. So the total available
    number of observations for study are 1920. The model is connected to UPS backup
    system for collecting continues 15 min interval dataset. D. Data Processing and
    Feature Extraction This is very important step in Machine Learning model development
    process to clean and to organize the data in suitable form to improve the accuracy
    and quality of Machine Learning Model. E. ML Model Development In the proposed
    study three supervised, classification algorithms are implemented on available
    dataset. The KNN machine learning classifier, Decision tree classifier and SVM
    algorithms are studied, and get the results with accuracy, confusion matrix with
    classification matrix. In data mining process large dataset are sorted, then pattern
    identification needs to perform and to do performance analysis establishing the
    relationship to solve the problem. This is called as data classification process
    in which the data classes and concepts are distinguishes and describing it for
    the process of model finding. The dataset was split into training dataset and
    testing dataset, which consist of 80% of the data as training data to train machine
    classifier and implement machine learning algorithm to develop the model. The
    testing dataset consist of 20% data to test the model. F. K-Nearest Neighbor In
    KNN it explores neighboring data point to be similar to them and then find the
    output. In KNN no training involves, the minimum distance k neighbor considers
    in classification. [15] G. Decision Tree It is tree-based technique used for building
    the prediction model. It is obtained by independent variable with every node have
    condition over a feature. Based on the condition decides which node get navigate
    next. When the leaf node reached output is predicted. It is one of the simple,
    understandable and easy to implement algorithm, it gives more accurate result.
    [11] H. SVM It helps to find non-linear boundaries by constructing a linear boundary
    in large, transformed version of feature space. It represents training data as
    a points in space separated in categories by large gap. [16] SECTION V. Train
    and Test the Model Here we fit our model on available dataset where input and
    outputs are known, then predictions are prepared on the unknown or new data input
    in the future. This train and test procedure can work appropriately only when
    sufficiently large dataset is available. The test data set used on training dataset
    for unbiased evaluation of the developed model. In present study actual dataset
    is divided in to 80–20 pattern, means training dataset size is 80% and remaining
    20% is testing dataset. From the available present dataset, we get 1388 observation
    in training data and 347 observation in testing dataset. From python machine learning
    library scikit-learn library perform this train and test splitting procedure using
    train _ test_ split() function. SECTION VI. Predicting the Outputs In the results
    of the evaluation part the accuracy and efficiency get checked. Also, the giving
    input data values of input parameter the accurate irrigation ON/OFF results are
    observed. Here, the results of applied algorithms are shown in the Figure 5 (a),
    (b), (c). Fig. 4. Classification report (a. KNN b. DT c. SVM) Show All Accuracy
    represents the correctness of the predicted observation to the total observation.
    The accuracy or the error of the predicted results calculated for performance
    calculation of the model. The number of correct prediction occurrence can be positive
    or negative, that can be consider as true positive and true negative. Precision
    and Recall are used as relevance measure. Precision is function of relevant instance
    from retrieved instance and recall is fraction of relevant instance retrieved
    from total instances. F1-Score is the weighted average of the precision and recall,
    is also called as F Measure or F Score. It is calculated as 2*((precision*recall)
    / (precision + recall)). It conveys balance between precision and recall. SECTION
    VII. Result The proposed model gives more accurate prediction results with the
    minimum error rate. The irrigation process managed through web interface. The
    model is totally functional and prediction results are also good. As per the predicted
    results of all three algorithm accuracy rate of K-Nearest Neighbor is 99 %, Decision
    Tree algorithm is 100% and SVM is 64 %. In Smart automatic irrigation system model,
    which is developed using machine learning algorithm. [11] The data is collected
    using different sensors and Decision Tree (DT) algorithm predict the result on
    data with 97.86% accuracy. Similarly, Anat Goldstein et. al. [10] developed model
    using different regression and classification algorithm. Regression algorithm,
    Gradient Boosted Regression Tree gives 93% accuracy and classification model,
    Boosted Tree Classifier gives 95% accuracy According to the proposed results Decision
    Tree gives more accurate result and it can more acceptable for auto irrigation
    system. This model helps to predict the results for irrigation process in the
    form of irrigation decision to switch the water motor ON/OFF. This system can
    be applicable for Agriculture field, greenhouse, polyhouse, housing society garden
    and also for home gardening. Future Guideline In the future system can be implement
    in the actual field using multiple nodes and in minimum cost also the system can
    expand by adding some more parameters like evapotranspiration prediction with
    real time metrological data. The proposed study can be extended to maintain the
    fertilizers requirement of the crop according to crop age in the farm. Similarly,
    tank water level monitoring can also maintain by some extension. SECTION VIII.
    Conclusion To improve crop productivity and to reduce the farming risk Machine
    Learning and IoT can help to make accurate decision on appropriate time by considering
    basic parameters and environmental data. Optimization of irrigation and crop health
    is particularly dependent on soil moisture value. Soil moisture value can be affected
    by some environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed etc. In
    the proposed study recent past sensor-based data is used to predict irrigation
    requirement. This paper proposed the improved irrigation process with IoT based
    architectural model and accurate irrigation ON and OFF decision prediction by
    machine learning algorithm. This system prototype is based on open standard technology
    and it is very cost effective. Use of technology for irrigation process in agriculture
    help to use optimal water and increase the productivity. Authors Figures References

  description: A majority of the population of developing countries is associated
    with agriculture directly or indirectly. The liaison of engineering technology
    and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can build a bridge for farmers to enhance
    their skills regarding advancements through future generation agriculture trends.
    The next-generation trends include better soil preparation, intelligent irrigation
    systems, advanced methods of crop nutrient inspection, smart fertilizers applications,
    and multi-cropping practices. This work proposes a smart Decision Support System
    (DSS) that acquires the input parameters based on real-time monitoring to optimize
    the yield that realizes sustainability by improving per hectare production and
    lessening water seepage wastage in agribusiness. The proposed model comprises
    three basic units including an intelligent sensor module, smart irrigation system
    and controlled fertilizer module. The system has integrated sensors, cloud employing
    decision support layers, and networking based DSS to recommend cautions for optimum
    sustainable yield. The intelligent sensors module contains a temperature and humidity
    sensor, NPK sensor, soil moisture sensor, soil conductivity sensor, and pH sensor
    to transmit the statistics to the cloud over the internet via Long Range (LoRa)
    using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol. Moreover, an android
    application has been developed for real-time data monitoring according to GPS
    location and node information (accessed remotely). Furthermore, the DSS contemplates
    the accessible information from sensors, past patterns, monitoring climate trends
    and creating cautions required for sustainable fertilizer consumption. The presented
    results and comparison validate the novelty of the design as it embraces smart
    irrigation with smart control and smart decision-making based on accurate real-time
    field data. It is better than existing systems as it transmits the data over the
    LoRa that is an open-source communication with long-range transmission ability
    up to several kilometres. The sensor nodes helped in advancing the yield of crops,
    which resulted in achieving inclusive and sustainable economic goals.

    A majority of the population of developing countries is associated with agriculture
    directly or indirectly. The liaison of engineering technology and Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) can build a bridge for farmers to enhance their skills
    regarding advancements through future generation agriculture trends. The next-generation
    trends include better soil preparation, intelligent irrigation systems, advanced
    methods of crop nutrient inspection, smart fertilizers applications, and multi-cropping
    practices. This work proposes a smart Decision Support System (DSS) that acquires
    the input parameters based on real-time monitoring to optimize the yield that
    realizes sustainability by improving per hectare production and lessening water
    seepage wastage in agribusiness. The proposed model comprises three basic units
    including an intelligent sensor module, smart irrigation system and controlled
    fertilizer module. The system has integrated sensors, cloud employing decision
    support layers, and networking based DSS to recommend cautions for optimum sustainable
    yield. The intelligent sensors module contains a temperature and humidity sensor,
    NPK sensor, soil moisture sensor, soil conductivity sensor, and pH sensor to transmit
    the statistics to the cloud over the internet via Long Range (LoRa) using Serial
    Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol. Moreover, an android application
    has been developed for real-time data monitoring according to GPS location and
    node information (accessed remotely). Furthermore, the DSS contemplates the accessible
    information from sensors, past patterns, monitoring climate trends and creating
    cautions required for sustainable fertilizer consumption. The presented results
    and comparison validate the novelty of the design as it embraces smart irrigation
    with smart control and smart decision-making based on accurate real-time field
    data. It is better than existing systems as it transmits the data over the LoRa
    that is an open-source communication with long-range transmission ability up to
    several kilometres. The sensor nodes helped in advancing the yield of crops, which
    resulted in achieving inclusive and sustainable economic goals. Keywords: LoRaWAN;

    Review The economies of developing countries are mostly agricultural dependent.
    Although the rise of industry and manufacturing have created more varied economies,
    a significant portion of GDP is still contributed by mentioned agribusiness segment
    [1]. The developing countries have been subjected to agricultural goods for foreign
    exchange. A considerable number of people have settled in agricultural zones,
    and the key income source of the world’s populace is grounded on agribusiness
    [2]. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a wide-ranging term that defines the interconnection
    of various everyday life tasks over the internet. It provides spectacular prospects
    for innovative tenders, which are now extensively used in numerous parts of life,
    i.e., intelligent home-based security systems, smart business chain systems, and
    precision agriculture [3]. The yield of crops can be improved by the introduction
    of IoT techniques for smart agriculture. As light, water, pH, soil moisture, and
    nutrients are the fundamental elements for crop development, the absence of proper
    facilities means that a lay farmer in a developing country cannot test the soil’s
    pH level, humidity, temperature, and necessary elements in the soil. It is very
    hard for a farmer to go to the testing laboratories to test the parameters because
    of long distances and costly tests. Therefore, IoT based real-time monitoring
    of the aforementioned necessities of a crop framework system has been proposed.
    The employment of embedded system automation in agriculture leads to efficient
    crop monitoring without human interference in the crop fields. Analysis and prediction
    become convenient based on real-time monitoring of the ecological aspects. The
    proposed system also helps to achieve efficient crop yield at an affordable price.
    Irrigation is the chief influence of farming, and water is the most demanding
    source of energy [4]. The old-fashioned irrigation methods have commanded inefficient
    water consumption in developing countries [5]. A total of 20% of the water (reserved
    for use in the agronomic division) is lost because of leakages, seepages, and
    line-losses in the waterway channels, i.e., canals [6]. To counter this issue,
    incorporating an automatic irrigation system that operates without necessitating
    the manual involvement of individuals is the need of the hour. The auto-irrigation
    system is ingeniously designed through commercially available sensors and other
    components. The DSS built agriculture engrosses in uninterrupted feedback monitoring
    of the related constraints and parameters that influence implications to control
    requirements for auto-irrigation. It ultimately helps in increasing the yield
    with nominal human interference. The systems available [7,8,9] either use a limited
    number of sensors or comprise low-range communication modules, i.e., Wi-Fi or
    Bluetooth, etc. The issue with low-range communication modules becomes severe
    when it comes to rural and remote areas. Most of the rural areas do not have reasonable
    speed in internet connectivity. This paper focused on the sensors and LoRa communication
    module that assists in long-range free of cost communication. In recent years,
    many studies, i.e., the work of Gondchawar et al. [6], have been done on smart
    agriculture techniques that implement Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to forecast
    crop yield by the perception of soil properties and environmental constraints.
    In the study of Balaji et al. [10] of the optimal crop, farming is fundamentally
    planned so that agronomists can harvest additional yield by using fewer possessions
    and agricultural areas. In addition, it is significant for warranting the productivity,
    efficiency, and consistency of the developed design. In respective regards, the
    fuzzy logic system, an up-to-date and operative method to cope with inaccurate,
    uncertain and unpredictable data, has made the procedure efficient, and precise.
    One of the earliest and standing approaches in agriculture is examining the various
    constraints and parameters. In the proposed technique of Bockstaller et al. [11],
    the farmers by themselves can validate all constraints and parameters. Smart agriculture
    emphasises emerging strategies, apparatuses, and devices for administering, presenting,
    and being aware of farmers using the benefits of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
    system. Sakthipriya et al. [12] has highlighted the development of smart farming
    systems through modern control and automation engineering with useful IoT objects,
    i.e., sensors, controllers and actuators. The prominent structures are GPS, and
    a smart robot that accomplishes farm duties including seeding, spraying, weeding,
    moisture sensing, human recognition and keeping observance by a controllable remote.
    The work of Jawad et al. [13], has validated the cloud computation devices. These
    devices can perform an entire computing task starting from sensors to devices
    that further sense the statistics from farmed ground pictures and farmers in the
    fields. Moreover, it precisely provides the information in the system by employing
    the position according to GPS coordinates. This study recommends an innovative
    procedure of smart farming by involving smart sensing detection with an auto-irrigation
    system. Rehman et al. in [14] proposed a system that allowed excess water to be
    saved, which is commonly wasted when conventional methods are practised. Gutiérrez
    et al. [15] suggest an inexpensive and effective WSN system to obtain the temperature
    and moisture of soil at several locations. The study of Sarmadian et al. [16]
    presents a crop estimation by cropland mapping remote sensing techniques. It has
    discussed the applications extensively used in farming and horticulture. Furthermore,
    Sonka et al. [17], has proposed that remote sensing is compulsory as the supervision
    of agrarian actions face unusual complications that are not common to other commercial
    sectors. The yield rests on the physical land (e.g., soil nature) and climatically
    driven variables and agronomic supervision practices. All variables are exceedingly
    inconstant by atmosphere and time. Moreover, as yield can alter in a short time
    due to inauspicious growing circumstances, agrarian monitoring systems need to
    be accurate with time. This is even more important, as most of the equipment is
    delicate. Subsequently, an investigation in the agronomic zone in a study by Kim
    et al. [18] proved that the harvest of cultivating is deteriorating step by step.
    However, utilization of innovation in agronomy has a basic impact in developing
    the creation just as in falling the extra human energy and endeavours. A valuable
    portion of the examination endeavours is accomplished for the advantage of agriculturalists,
    which conveys the frameworks that utilization of modern technology for expanding
    the agronomic output. According to the study of Bor et al. [19], LoRaWAN is able
    to extend transmission limits as compared to conventionally deployed IoT communication
    modules, whilst at the same time with less energy usage. Furthermore, LoRa offers
    appealing characteristics as non-destructive synchronized communications. The
    LoRa module can be utilized in supplementary wide-ranging network systems, not
    just the only one used by LoRaWAN. Thus, the LoRa communication modules support
    a fascinating selection for developing conventional IoT functions. The article
    of Adelantado et al. [20] presents the extent of LoRaWAN by investigating the
    restrictions of the innovation, coordinating with them to application use cases,
    and expressing the open exploration challenges. The work also depicts that a LoRaWAN
    gateway covers a several kilometre range in wireless communication and serves
    the concept of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) connectivity. In further, system testing
    by Wixted et al. [21] recognized some significant factors that affect the usefulness
    of LoRaWAN. The unpredictability of the gateway’s mobile network assignment and
    the use of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) between a gateway and network server means
    that sensor statistics and functional data about the networks are lost. The only
    remaining packet loss is around 1%. This might be credited to some long span (up
    to 10 s), wide-band (2 MHz) modulated signals pivoted around 868 MHz that is seen
    on a few events. The wellspring of this signal has not yet been distinguished.
    On various occasions, gateways are noticing demodulating simultaneous transmissions
    as planned. In the proposed system of Lakshmisudha et al. [22], a procedure to
    survey the use of remote sensor network utilized in mechanizing water system and
    data is shipped off the webserver through remote correspondence. The sensors are
    utilized to recognize the temperature and moisture for crop observation. The watering
    system is automated when the sensor detects beneath the limit values. The rancher
    is routinely intimated with the field climate. In fields, light power control
    can be robotized in the collection of the water system. Here, the gauge of harvesting
    water need is not proficient. The research of Dimitrios et al. [23], shows that
    the yield of crops can be increased by linking the crop model with the sensing
    node. It also presents a method to combine sensing node data with a crop model
    to measure the effect of climate change on crop yield. Moreover, the work of G.Hoogenboom
    et al. [24], presented a Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT).
    This work presents crop management by using environmental data to develop a simulation
    for soil data response. The presented data is useful not only for research, but
    also for planning to enhance production. The article of J. W. Jones et al. [25],
    suggests improving the DSSAT system because it deals with specific crops and it
    does not account for the change in environment, the effect of pests, excess of
    water and many other factors. In the works of J.W. Jones et al. [26], the proposed
    system is not accurate or beneficial for big data. It comprises a DSSAT system
    model to test soil, temperature, individual crop interface and pest models. The
    best of the technologies are employed in the above literature, however, the proposed
    systems are more advanced, intelligent and viable to increase crop yield by monitoring
    and automating the appropriate parameters of the fields. Most of the existing
    studies have used Wi-Fi, GPRS, GSM, 3G, 4G or Zigbee that carries a range up to
    a few meters. Contrarily, the major problem in rural areas is the internet and
    connectivity. Long-range connectivity for communication can resolve this problem
    that has been considered by a limited number of papers. The existing works have
    used LoRa but with very few sensors, making the smart decision-making system less
    beneficial and important. In this study, the monitoring can provide information
    about crop yield and assist in recognizing the cause of the low crop yield production
    in agriculture by using more sensors and much advanced LoRa communication. The
    problem is significant, and the proposed solution provides a system that can easily
    tackle the aforementioned issues. The data are collected from agricultural land
    through sensor nodes interfaced with the hardware on the board. This hardware
    possesses different components, i.e., the ADC converter, LoRa module, and the
    entire interfaced sensor node. This has been enclosed in the plastic casing and
    charged using solar energy. Further, there is a wired broadband connection at
    the paced where available. The receiving node has been incorporated to receive
    the data from the sending sensor node and transmit the data over the internet
    to the cloud. Moreover, the data have been displayed in the android application.
    The major objectives of the study are given below. Development of solar-powered
    GPS based LoRa sensor nodes and transference of real-time data to central server/cloud
    through IoT gateway from the integrated nodes installed in geographically distributed
    locations. Development of an online cloud database to store and process the data
    from multiple installed nodes at various fields. The development of a DSS system
    software that takes into deliberation the available data from sensors and consequently
    provides recommendations, auto-irrigation, suggestions and alarms needed for optimal
    yield for each location. The development of an android application where data
    from the cloud has been received, and real-time data along with projected recommendations
    in the form of notifications are available for each site. The above objectives
    are set in the light of the 2030 objective for SDGs adopted by all UN Member countries
    (in 2015) that provide a blueprint to enhance prosperity and peace for people.
    They opted for 17 SDGs which call for action by all countries through global partnership.
    This work would help by mapping intelligent DSS of SDGs to enhance crop yield
    by automating irrigation and controlled fertilizer. It would help developing countries
    to enhance their economic position by adopting human-friendly technology. 2. Materials
    and Methods The planning of this observing framework is capable of monitoring
    parameters while deployed at different locations on the farm field to give recommendations
    and cautions required for optimum yield. The sensor system, containing soil moisture,
    humidity, NPK, temperature, and pH sensors, transmits the statistics to the cloud
    over the internet. An android application has been developed for users for monitoring
    available real-time information at any place and any time. The monitoring can
    provide data about potato yield and assist in recognizing the cause of the low
    production of potato yield. The data has been collected from agricultural land
    through sensors interfaced with the hardware on the board. The proposed system
    possesses different components, i.e., ESP32, LoRa module, and the entire interfaced
    sensor board that encloses in a PVC casing and charged using solar energy. 2.1.
    The Architecture of the Proposed System In this section, a detailed description
    of hardware and software components given, alongside the specifications of components
    used in this implementation. The hardware has been divided into three different
    layers. Collecting data through sensors Data transmission Data acquisition and
    display of data First, the data has been collected from agricultural land through
    the combination of multiple sensors. The sensors provide soil moisture, pH level,
    GPS location, humidity and temperature from the targeted land. This data is further
    transmitted to the web server using logic through a sensor board and ESP32, where
    all data have been analysed. Data are then displayed through an android application.
    The flow of the data between the components of the proposed system can be seen
    in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows a gathering of data from the field through sensors
    and then the movement of data through LoRaWAN by passing through all attached
    models. Figure 1. The proposed system overview showing flow of sensors data gathering
    and further movement through LoRa. 2.1.1. Hardware Design of the Sensing Layer
    The sensor layer comprises a few gatherings of sensor nodes. The sensor nodes
    and actuator nodes are important for this layer and can be conveyed to various
    territories of agricultural land or several agricultural areas. The fundamental
    contrast between these nodes is that the sensing nodes mostly gather and send
    the information to the sending node, i.e., ESP32 in the sending end layer, while
    the actuator node gets from the sensors and makes the actuators act as needed,
    i.e., to turn on the water pump and so on. Figure 2 proposes the block diagram
    of the designed system. Figure 2. Hierarchical data flow diagram of DSS. A model
    schematic of the proposed sensor node is shown in Figure 3, comprising an MCU,
    LoRa wireless module, and various sensors. The connection of the pins of the components,
    i.e., the sensors section that includes DHT22, MQ135, NEO M6, NPK, soil moisture
    and temperature sensors, can also be seen in the Figure. Similarly, the pinout
    of ESP32 is shows the connections of its pins with other components. ESP32 has
    built-in WIFI and Bluetooth modules and also supports the RS485 communication
    module. It is a low power consuming MCU and also has the benefits of robust action
    that other MCUs lack. Moreover, the LoRa communication section shows the Pout
    and Pin connections for the configuration of the LoRa module. Figure 3. Schematic
    of sensing layer. Based on the proposed schematic of the sending node, the prototype
    is also designed by selecting the suitable components. In Figure 4, the prototype
    of the proposed sending node is designed that comprise all the sensors and ESP32
    MCU. Figure 4. Prototype of sensing layer. Contingent upon the sensor node position,
    a portion of the sensor nodes are furnished with solar panels. A portion of the
    equipment parts of a sensor node is associated using a LoRa remote communication
    protocol as LoRaWAN upholds a sensible information rate with low energy utilization.

    Humidity Sensor Air Quality Sensor Soil Conductivity Sensor Soil pH Sensor 2.1.2.
    Hardware Design of the Data Receiving Layer from Sensing Layer The receiving layer
    is framed by equipment comprising MCU and LoRa modules responsible for accepting
    information from sensor nodes using LoRa, preparing information, and sending the
    handled and compacted information to individual LoRa gateways through LoRaWAN.
    The transitional advance serves to fundamentally lessen the measure of information
    communicated over the LoRa gateways and satisfy the exacting prerequisites of
    LoRa’s obligation cycle. A LoRa gateway principally comprises an inserted board
    with LoRa remote module. These gateways can be outfitted with sensors. These gateways
    are outfitted with Linux since Linux offers numerous benefits, i.e., being allowed
    to utilize, lightweight, upgraded security, customization, dependability and eliteness,
    while Linux doesn’t need outstanding equipment. LoRa gateway offers numerous benefits
    administrations, for example, message pop-up, channel classification and security.
    For example, when a passage identifies irregularities, for instance, equipment
    errors in sensor hubs, the gateway can send a text to end clients, users or agriculturists,
    to advise about the issue. The prospects of information preparing in the sending
    layer range from multi-robot planning [27], to bio-signal examination [28,29].
    It consists of a LoRa module and Node MCU. The MCU processes the data it receives
    from the sending node and further Analog-to-Digital (ADC) conversion has been
    performed. Once the conversion is completed, the data from the sensing layer (node)
    is transmitted over the internet (Google Firebase in this case). The primary function
    of this layer is to transmit data, hence, it is also called the transmission layer.
    The proposed schematic of the receiving node has been shown in Appendix A Figure
    A1. 2.2. Software Design Data Acquisition and Display Layer There are three levels
    in the data acquisition layer. The primary level comprises a discretionary gathering
    of repeaters that principally get the information from the LoRa module and forward
    that to the cloud through the LoRa gateway. The utilization of this level and
    number of repeaters relies upon the distance between the arrangement area, i.e.,
    a far off-field, and the closest LoRa gateway. In the works of Petajajarvi et
    al. [30], around 20 repeaters were needed to keep a stable LoRa correspondence
    connected over a distance of 300 km, close to the signal transmission line. The
    researchers caution that even though LoRa can give long-range transmissions (for
    example, 25 to 30 km), packet loss of data increases significantly (after the
    10–15 km threshold). The second level in the receiving layer comprises a progression
    of interconnected LoRa gateways linked with each other and share data about sensor
    hubs if they are nearby. We have assumed that the LoRa modules are not associated
    through LAN, VPNs or other virtual communication network arrangements and the
    LoRa gateways are situated in regions with stable internet connectivity. Furthermore,
    the LoRa doors are associated with cloud servers using Wi-Fi, Ethernet, 3G or
    4G. The LoRa passages can offer progressed administrations including pop-up messages,
    circulated information stockpiling, security, information combination, and information
    preparation. More itemized data of LoRa benefits has been examined by authors
    of existing literature including [18,31,32,33,34]. Please see Table 1. The third
    level comprises cloud servers and their administrations, i.e., worldwide information
    storage, big data investigation, message pop-up, information handling with complex
    calculations. Contingent upon the application, explicit cloud administration has
    been carried out. The end-client terminal layer comprises android applications
    and internet browsers which are utilized to get constant information, and information
    orders to control sensors in distant agricultural lands. The display layer then
    collects the data from the cloud and transmits it to the android application.
    Moreover, the design, development and working of the application have been discussed
    in (Section 2.4.1) while the decision support system has been illustrated in (Section
    2.4.2). Table 1. Specifications of the Components Used. 2.3. Interfacing of Prototype
    Sensors This section presents the interfacing of sensors used in this work. To
    design the hardware setup, all sensors must be properly interfaced with other
    modules for functionality. All the sensors are interfaced and tested in different
    ways for hardware deployment. The real-time sensing node deployment in the farm
    fields can be seen in Figure 5. Figure 5. On-field deployment of sensing nodes.
    2.4. Software Development for the Proposed System This section presents the design,
    interfacing and integration of hardware and software. We have deployed an IoT
    based smart agriculture framework to take the precision of irrigation and farming
    system with real-time information. As a matter of first importance, agriculturists
    ‘login’ into the application by using a username and password on an android device
    that permits the user to choose yield for the respective season. Further, the
    framework has been carried out in three layers listed below. Sensing. Processing
    and Sending. Receiving and displaying. In Figure 6, the detecting stage detects
    the physical values of various parameters including temperature, NPK portions,
    humidity and moisture, etc. Moreover, each sensor has been further connected to
    the ESP32. All this data is transmitted to the LoRa gateway through the LoRa RA02
    module. At the receiving end, the Node MCU has built-in Wi-Fi to connect the receiving
    node with the internet and upload data on the fire-base cloud. Figure 6. Procedural
    flow of the proposed system. 2.4.1. Android Application Development An android
    application is developed with the help of android studio. The layout of the application
    is displayed below. The layout of the application consists of three parameters
    on the dashboard. These are home alerts and controls. After logging in, the real-time
    data is shown on the home screen. All the recommendations, suggestions and alerts
    are given in the alert screen and the control tab controls, i.e., turning auto-irrigation
    and alerts ON or OFF. Real-Time Data: In this tab, real-time data of all the sensors
    are shown which is fetched from the Firebase database. Alerts: In this tab, three
    types of alerts are shown. The first is about irrigation, giving alerts after
    processing moisture level. The nutrients portion suggests the fertilizers according
    to the values of NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium). The last portion is about
    PH, that suggests the right use of chemicals to control the PH. Control: In the
    control tab, we can control the auto irrigation, and forcefully turn ON or OFF
    the irrigation and android application notifications. 2.4.2. Decision Support
    System The DSS analyses data and makes assessments that contribute to decisions
    about auto-irrigation, pH, and other soil nutrients utilizing real-time acquired
    data. First, the farmer signs into the android application using his ID, such
    as a unique username and passcode. 2.4.3. The Algorithm Used by the Proposed DSS
    System Further, the home screen shows up, and the user is instructed to allow
    notifications and TURN ON the auto-irrigation system. The system is implemented
    in three different phases, i.e., Sensing, Processing and Data Allocation. The
    sensing is the first phase that passes the setting of all environmental parameters,
    i.e., temperature, pH level, soil moisture/temperature, humidity, NPK proportions,
    soil conductivity, and air quality. All these sensors are connected to the ESP32
    MCU board. This board directs the data to the ESP32, which functions as the LoRa
    gateway in the built system as it has the capability to communicate the data to
    the cloud. This communication is performed using the LoRa RA-02 module. The further
    processing phase is performed in the server, i.e., the cloud. The cloud comprises
    a server, a database where the acquired information is retained, and a decision
    algorithm that holds decisions established based on acquired data from sensors.
    In the final phase of data allocation, the output of the decision algorithm has
    been delivered to the android application and next to the IoT gateway. The DSS
    is a simple algorithm built by using “if, else and if-else” statements. It makes
    the code smoother, more efficient, and simpler with better performance as compared
    to the existing complex systems. The end-to-end Algorithm 1 of the smart farming
    system is given below. Algorithm 1 The Algorithm Used by the Proposed DSS System
    Start Continuously acquire sensor data A/D conversion of the sensed data on the
    ESP32 Board – In case of the water or soil moisture level is low: * An alert is
    sent to the cloud to show a notification. * Check if auto irrigation is TURN ON
    · The relay and the water pump are turned ON automatically. Send the data (pH,
    NPK proportions, moisture, air quality) to the cloud through the IoT Gateway.
    If the data is above or below the threshold – Check if notifications are TURN
    ON in mobile application. – If the user selected Turn ON. * In case if pH or any
    other nutrient levels are not up to the mark, a control signal is sent to the
    cloud. * Control signal is then sent to the IoT gateway. * The IoT gateway triggers
    the data and show it as a notification on the android application. – Else if user
    selects turn OFF * A control signal is sent to the cloud * Store the data and
    continuously retrieve it until notifications are allowed. – Endif Else – Continue
    checking for the threshold condition Endif End The algorithm of DSS shown in Figure
    7 has been further explained below. Figure 7 makes it convenient even for a non-specialist
    person to comprehend the system. As discussed earlier, the sensors get data from
    the fields and further send it to the cloud/android application to display the
    values for the user. Moreover, known threshold values of every parameter are stored
    in the designed system, which helps make decisions and give recommendations for
    the fields in which the sensors are incorporated. In this regard, first comes
    the parameter of soil moisture level. As in our case, the normal value is between
    60% and 80%. When the value is in between the statistics, the system does nothing.
    But when the value is less, it checks if the user turns ON the auto-irrigation
    or not. Figure 7. The algorithm used by the proposed DSS system. If yes, it automatically
    turns ON the water pump. If the water supply is high, it shows the notification
    of a high-water level. As the system also comprises the NPK sensor, take the example
    of nitrogen in the soil. The normal value of nitrogen required for a crop is between
    50–70 mg/kg. If the value is in between the statistics, it shows the normal options
    and no warnings. However, if the nitrogen value is below the threshold value of
    50 mg/kg, it divides it into two categories. The first category is a slightly
    ‘low value’ from 49–30 mg/kg and tells the user to use appropriate fertilizers,
    i.e., sodium nitrate etc. If the value is below 30, it is considered deficient
    and recommends strong nitrogenous fertilizers, i.e., urea, ammonium nitrate, etc.
    Similar is the case if some nutrient’s quantity is high. The same goes with other
    nutrients, i.e., phosphorus, potassium. The algorithm for other parameters, i.e.,
    pH, soil conductivity, air temperature and moisture, etc., is also the same. 3.
    Results and Discussion The main objective of this study is to develop GPS based
    LoRaWAN sensor nodes to transfer real-time data to the central server/cloud through
    an IoT gateway. The WSN nodes are deployed in geographically distributed locations
    for different crops. The development of logic-based DSS software at the cloud
    considers available data from sensors, historical trends and the impact of weather
    patterns and accordingly provide suggestions, alarms needed for optimal yield
    for each site. The planning of this observing framework has been done that enables
    the monitoring of crop parameters while deployed in the field at different locations
    on the farm. After deploying the proposed system, the farmers or the landowners
    can easily monitor their farms through a smartphone application. The designed
    application helps to store and retrieve data at any time from any remote location.
    The monitoring can provide information about crop yield and assist in recognising
    the cause of low yield production in agriculture. The problem is significant,
    and the proposed solution provides a system to easily tackle these issues. Moreover,
    the data collected from agricultural land through sensors and tools interfaced
    with the hardware on the board. The sensors are first interfaced with ESP32. The
    data has been sent to the receiving node with the help of the LoRa module, where
    a Node MCU is connected, and then this MCU transmits the data through the internet
    to the cloud. Once the data is transmitted on the web server via LoRa, it can
    be easily displayed on the android application. We have also analysed real-time
    data on the serial monitor and generated the AP (Access Point) mode of the ESP32
    controller that retrieve data from controller to IP address of NodeMCU through
    the internet. It is mandatory to test the precision of the hardware setup. Hence,
    a specific area is decided for testing and implementation of the hardware module
    and values are assigned to specific parameters, i.e., temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, etc. These values are monitored all the time by the hardware module.
    An android application, developed with the help of the android studio, consists
    of a dashboard, which contains main parameters, such as notifications, alarms,
    controls, etc. 3.1. Retrieving the Real-Time Sensor Data Initially, the data has
    been collected from fields, and further processed on the ESP32. After this, the
    data has been sent to the receiving node. The next step is displaying data on
    the serial monitor of NodeMCU. Similarly, coding has helped in this aspect. By
    enabling the IP address of NodeMCU using coding and further connecting the NodeMCU
    with the internet, all the data of NodeMCU has been displayed at the IP address
    of NodeMCU. All the data has been stored in the cloud and can easily be retrieved
    from this cloud storage to the Android Application. 3.2. Uploading Sensor Data
    at Fire-Base Cloud Google fire-base is used as cloud storage. Cloud storage may
    be a package model during which statistics are sustained, processed, stored the
    slightest bit, and formed around the handlers via a network, mostly through the
    Internet. The users characteristically purchase cloud storage according to their
    requirements at a fixed rate. While the per gigabyte value has been radically
    driven down, cloud storage suppliers have additional operating expenses that can
    make the technology further expensive. Cloud security continues to be the priority
    among users, hence, the providers have strained to contend with those uncertainties
    by an edifying security competence. Cloud storage involves transferring a file
    to the web that is available for an associate degree extended amount of your time.
    The simplest variety of cloud storage is uploading one thing to a server and having
    the power to retrieve it when required. The detailed results are displayed on
    the IP Address of NodeMCU. Cloud results play an important role in this data transfer.
    The data are easily gathered using a cloud server, and it is retrieved on the
    android application. 3.3. Sensor Data at Android Application The data are displayed
    on the android application as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. Specifically, Figure
    9 shows the front-end of the android application developed to display the back-end
    functionality in a managed way. The application has four Graphical User Interfaces
    (GUIs): one showing sensors data, a second for notifications, a third for auto
    irrigation and the last for real-time location. The farmers and agriculture experts
    can easily monitor and operate the application by simply logging in by entering
    the username, passcode and node ID (2-factor authentication). Figure 8. Cloud
    Front-end Showing Statistics of Sensors. Figure 9. User Interface of Android Application
    to Observe Sensor Reading. As depicted in Table 2, the proposed study is better
    in comparison with the existing studies for many reasons, as this system comprises
    a Long-Range communication module while the existing systems use the conventional
    modules, i.e., Bluetooth [35] and Wi-Fi [36]. Contrary to the existing studies,
    the proposed system is a complete package of smart agriculture as it comprises
    major parameters of automated farming including auto-irrigation, a group of sensors,
    and also an android application with DSS, while the existing systems, as in the
    works of Jawad et al. [13] and in the study of Gutiérrez et al. [15], only focused
    on limited parameters. Table 2. Comparison of the proposed and existing systems.
    The system presented in [13] has been purely a theoretical system that is designed
    using highly complex algorithms, while the proposed systems used efficient algorithms.
    Moreover, the system given by the authors [15] uses a GPRS module for communication
    that not only consumes much power but also is closed source and paid, while the
    proposed system uses the open-source LoRa communication module. A comprehensive
    comparison between the existing literature and the proposed system has been carried
    out in Table 2. The presented results and comprehensive comparison of the proposed
    system with existing systems validate the implementation design, as it enables
    the farmers to monitor their crops and automatically controls environmental parameters
    without human intervention. It increases the system accuracy while reducing the
    labour cost and ultimately increases the crop yield. It also helps to achieve
    sustainable and resilient infrastructure that ultimately promote inclusive and
    sustainable industrialization in agribusiness and foster innovation. Until now,
    the prototype is compatible in limited areas and cannot extract data from encryption
    sensors. For betterment in the future, a better and more well-developed system
    can be introduced. Therefore, it has been helpful in improving the monitoring
    and testing of large-scale areas. 4. Conclusions This work implements a DSS system
    built using WSN, LoRa based platform, and an android application to automate the
    environmental parameters for optimal crop yields. The presented prototype is proficient
    in monitoring crop parameters while deployed in the field at different locations
    of the farm. We have used a LoRa module communication for an efficient smart agriculture
    technique intended to monitor and regulate ecological components in cultivation.
    The proposed low-cost system unceasingly monitors the precise stats and transmits
    these stats to the farmer through a gateway and an android application. The presented
    results also validate the proposed design as the accessibility of real-time information
    facilitates rapid usage and supervision of all locations of the farm. Additionally,
    the proposed system offers auto-irrigation, and auto-adjustment of environmental
    parameters by carrying the facility of wireless data transmission to the designed
    application. Large-scale deployment of the proposed system would help the farmers
    to improve their financial situation with enhanced crop yield and hence, the SDGs
    may be attained with smart system deployment in agriculture globally. In a future
    perspective, the proposed automated system can be integrated with a drone-assisted
    strategy proposed by Sharma et al. [37]. In addition, a separate thermal imaging
    camera (along with drone technology) can be deployed to supervise the crop farm.
    If a pest is inhabiting crop leaves, a drone equipped with a spray tank can be
    used to spray anti-pest liquid on an affected area of the crop farm. Author Contributions

- analysis: 'The paper describes an integrated solution for smart agriculture that
    focuses on cost-effectiveness, water consumption optimization, and renewable energy
    integration. The system leverages IoT devices for data acquisition and control,
    Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization, and storage, and fuzzy logic
    for irrigation control. The solution has been deployed and tested in a real-world
    Smart Farm testbed, and the results show that it reduces water consumption by
    up to 71.8% compared to traditional irrigation systems.


    The paper is relevant to the point about different data types and their collection
    and use because it provides a detailed description of the data collection and
    processing components of the smart agriculture system. The system collects data
    on soil moisture, temperature, water level, solar energy production, and water
    pump energy consumption. This data is used to make informed decisions about irrigation
    scheduling, water level control, and energy management.


    The paper''s contributions include:


    - A cost-effective and easy-to-deploy general architecture for a Smart Farm testbed
    that the research community can easily adopt and adapt for further testing and
    improvement.

    - A detailed description of how to use open-source software and leverage Cloud

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\\\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field

    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.

    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

- analysis: 'The paper describes the development and deployment of a low-cost and
    open-source weather station (LOCOS) for on-farm monitoring and decision support.
    The LOCOS system is based on an Arduino microcontroller and uses a variety of
    sensors to measure temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar
    radiation. The system is designed to be affordable, easy to use, and accurate,
    and it has the potential to provide farmers with valuable information to help
    them make better decisions about irrigation, pest management, and other farm operations.


    The paper presents the results of two case studies that demonstrate the utility
    of the LOCOS system. In the first case study, four LOCOS systems were deployed
    in a vineyard to measure microclimates and inform disease management decisions.
    The results showed that there was significant variability in microclimates within
    the vineyard, and that the LOCOS systems were able to capture this variability.
    This information could be used to develop more targeted disease management strategies
    that could reduce the need for pesticides.


    In the second case study, five LOCOS systems were deployed in two adjacent fields
    to measure evaporative demand and inform irrigation scheduling decisions. The
    results showed that there was a significant difference in evaporative demand between
    the two fields, and that this difference was related to the type of irrigation
    system that was being used. This information could be used to develop more efficient
    irrigation schedules that could save water and energy.


    Overall, the paper provides evidence that the LOCOS system is a valuable tool
    for on-farm monitoring and decision support. The system is affordable, easy to
    use, and accurate, and it can provide farmers with valuable information to help
    them make better decisions about irrigation, pest management, and other farm operations.'

    1. Introduction Regional weather data are available throughout most of the United
    States, but the information is not widely incorporated into most agricultural
    decision making processes (Blum and Miller, 2019, Haigh et al., 2018, Uccellini
    and Ten Hoeve, 2019). It is unclear if weather information from regional networks
    can accurately represent site-specific conditions. To gather site-specific weather
    information, commercial services and equipment are available that can provide
    on-site weather observations. One constraint with private weather stations is
    that many commercial systems are only compatible with a narrow selection of sensor
    types and use proprietary communication protocols. This limits the farmer’s ability
    to customize designs to fit their farm and practices, which is an important factor
    in the success of on-farm decision-support tools (Mase and Prokopy, 2014). Challenges
    of collecting on-site weather data also include the technical skill and time required
    to maintain sensors and to record data, the resources and knowledge required to
    convert raw data into useful information, and the knowledge of how to select appropriate
    sites. Thus, the quality and value of weather data can be difficult to verify,
    so that uncertainty and lack of trust can prevent adoption of on-farm weather
    systems. It can be advantageous to have multiple on-farm weather stations because
    conditions can vary within and between fields. For example, prevention of damage
    from disease and frost can be improved by using high resolution data that captures
    within field variability (Renehan et al., 2020, Thakur et al., 2019). There are
    many benefits to managing at sub-field spatial scales (Kelley and Pardyjak, 2019,
    Prokopy et al., 2017), with a concomitant requirement for distributed sensor systems
    (Buhrig and Shock, 2015, Carland et al., 2013, Kim and Evans, 2009), and a platform
    to integrate a large amount of data (Kelley et al., 2020, Leroux et al., 2018,
    Lindblom et al., 2017). However, commercial weather stations can be costly. The
    price of sensors alone can be expensive, some costing upwards of $200 per sensor,
    and most on-farm applications require subscription services to transmit and store
    information, which imparts recurring costs. As a result, farmers often choose
    to install a limited number of stations, resulting in a reduced spatial fidelity
    of weather data. Low cost do-it-yourself (DIY) local energy-budget measurement
    stations (LEMS) have performed well compared to higher costs commercial instruments
    for 1/10th of the price (Gunawardena et al., 2018). Others have published similar
    successes in the development of low-cost weather stations using open-source platforms
    and embedded computer systems (Fisher and Gould, 2012, Ibrahim Musa, 2018, Pieters
    et al., 2020). However, the application of low-cost and open-source weather stations
    for use as on-farm decision support tools have not been thoroughly evaluated.
    We developed a low-cost and open-source weather station (LOCOS) specifically designed
    to inform farm management decisions in a commercial agricultural operation. We
    tested how multiple distributed weather stations can be used to provide more spatially
    resolved weather data to augment decision support in two different field studies.
    For the first field study, a vineyard manager was concerned with grape powdery
    mildew (Erysiphe necator). The goal of this application was to use weather data
    from four LOCOS distributed across the vineyard to inform targeted disease management
    and cost-effective spray schedules. For the second field study, we used LOCOS
    to verify the efficiency of upgraded center-pivot irrigation systems. The primary
    objective of this paper is to use data and observations from these two case studies
    to assess the utility of distributed LOCOS to facilitate decision support. Secondly,
    we compare a variety of low-cost sensors to their high-quality counterparts to
    assess the relative accuracy of the LOCOS. Lastly, we identify improvements for
    future iterations of on-farm weather-based decision support tools. 2. Methods
    2.1. Datalogger, power system, and hardware design The LOCOS design consists of
    a datalogger and power system than can integrate with a variety of sensors. An
    Arduino MEGA 2560 microcontroller (Arduino MEGA 2560; Arduino Inc., Ivrea, Italy)
    was paired with an Adafruit data logging shield (PN 1141, Adafruit Industries,
    New York City, NY) to create an embedded computer system for logging sensor data.
    The Arduino MEGA 2560 board was programmed using the open source Arduino IDE software
    (Arduino IDE 1.8.7, Arduino Inc., Ivrea, Italy). The data logging shield is equipped
    with an SD card reader and real time clock (RTC) to synchronize reading and writing
    data. The total cost of the electrical components needed to build and power system
    the datalogger is approximately $144 USD (Table 1). Table 1. Station datalogger

    cost of logger components: $ 144 The embedded system was powered by a 10 W solar
    panel (L02P10-N-1; Eco-Worthy, Los Angeles, CA) with an inline charge controller
    (SunGuard; Morningstar Corp., Newtown, PA) that regulates a 12 V battery (PS-1250;
    Power Sonic Corp., Reno, NV). To reduce power consumption, an external switching
    voltage regulator (TSR-1; Traco Power, Baar, Switzerland) was used to down regulate
    the 12 V battery voltage to 5 V DC instead of the Arduino’s internal voltage regulator,
    which is known to be inefficient (Gjanci and Chowdhury, 2008). A low power library
    (https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power) was used to put the micro-controller
    in a low power sleep mode when not taking a measurement. As a result of these
    modifications, the LOCOS can operate for 6 days with no solar charging, which
    is ample supply in full sunlight and partly cloudy conditions. The embedded computer
    system, battery and charge controller were housed in a water-tight plastic enclosure
    (Fig. 1A). A low-cost radiation shield was modified so that the temperature and
    humidity sensor could be mounted inside and PVC conduit and fittings were used
    to build a custom enclosure for an infrared thermometer (IRT) (Fig. 1B). Download

    The datalogger was compatible with sensors that use inter-integrated circuit (I2C)
    and SDI-12 communication protocols, which adds flexibility in the types of sensors
    that can be used to meet unique applications (Fig. 2). Many low-cost open-source
    sensors use I2C communication, and the SDI-12 bus allows for integration with
    higher quality sensors developed by commercial environmental sensor manufacturers.
    The EnviroDIY Arduino SDI-12 library (https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12)
    was used to communicate with the SDI-12 sensors. Adding the SDI-12 functionality
    required modifying the pin change interrupt (PCINT) assignments in the Arduino’s
    internal software serial protocol and the EnviroDIY SDI-12 library (https://github.com/EnviroDIY/Arduino-SDI-12/issues/8).

    system was used for the irrigation study, with the addition of an SHT-31 sensor
    connected to the I2C bus. The sensors used in the irrigation study were selected
    to measure the parameters necessary to calculate Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration
    (Table 2). With affordability being the primary design constraint in this study,
    low cost sensors including the Melexis MLX90614 (MLX90614; Melexis, Ieper, Belgium)
    infrared thermometer (IRT) and the Sensirion SHT-31 temperature and humidity sensor
    (SHT-31D; Sensirion, ZH, Switzerland) were used. The LOCOS used in the vineyard
    study were equipped with a suite of sensors to capture plant canopy conditions
    associated with grape powdery mildew. The sensors used in this study were moderate-cost
    and higher quality (Table 3). Table 2. LESA Irrigation Study Sensor Suite (*now

    County, Idaho, USA, and both fields were planted to malting barley (Hordeum vulgare).
    One of the center-pivots was equipped with a conventional mid-elevation spray
    application package with sprinkler nozzles suspended two meters above the ground
    surface, and a second center-pivot with a low elevation spray application (LESA)
    sprinkler package, which lowers the sprinkler nozzles to approximately 50 cm from
    the ground surface. The LESA system was designed to increase irrigation efficiency
    by reducing spray drift from wind (Sarwar et al., 2019). However, the actual reduction
    in consumptive water use was unverified. The goal of this study was to use the
    LOCOS to quantify differences in evaporative demand between the conventional and
    LESA fields. Ten years of wind data was obtained from a nearby USBR Agrimet weather
    station (Ashton, ID). Weather data were used to locate two stations according
    to the predicted daytime fetch of the two fields respectively, and a fifth station
    upwind of both fields to provide observations of the non-irrigated weather condition.
    In total, the five LOCOS were installed: one upwind of both fields, one near the
    center of each field, and one downwind of each field (Fig. 3). All stations had
    an SHT-31 mounted at a height of approximately 1 m, and the upwind station (ASH1)
    was equipped with an SP-421 pyranometer (SP-421; Apogee Instruments, Logan, UT,
    USA) to measure down welling shortwave radiation (see Table 4). Download : Download

    and RH (1.65 m) Surface temperature (1.05 m) The five LOCOS were installed after
    the barley emergence on 06 June and removed on 20 August 2019 immediately following
    harvest. The LOCOS recorded sensor data on five-minute intervals (Fig. 1b). Four
    cup and vane anemometers (Vantage Pro2 Anemometer; Davis Instruments, Hayward,
    CA) were installed at 1 and 3 m heights, at two locations upwind and downwind
    of the LESA center pivot (corresponding to day time wind direction). Wind speed
    and direction were logged on five-minute intervals by EC100 dataloggers (EC100;
    Decagon Inc., Pullman, WA). Only the anemometer datalogger at the downwind location
    operated continuously for the entire season, and these data were used in the reference
    evapotranspiration calculation for all stations. The tall reference evapotranspiration
    (ETr) was calculated following the ASCE Standardized Equation (“ASCE Manual 70
    – Second Edition,” 2015). The five separate calculations of ETr upwind, within,
    and downwind of each field were compared to quantify differences in evaporative
    demand between the two fields. Data collection at the individual stations was
    intermittent throughout the season, particularly during the first month of the
    study period until programming issues were resolved. Other reasons for intermittent
    operation included water damage when enclosures were flooded by overhead irrigation.
    In order to interpolate short gaps in records of individual stations (<1 day),
    linear regressions comparing each measured weather parameter for all five individual
    stations and the corresponding data at the Agrimet station were established. These
    linear regressions were then used to interpolate gaps in the individual station
    records. The USBR Agrimet weather station (denoted AHTI) was located 1.5 miles
    (2.4 km) north of the study site. Data was downloaded from the Agrimet online
    data portal for the entire growing season. Fifteen-minute weather records from
    AHTI (solar radiation, wind speed and direction, air temperature and humidity)
    were interpolated to five-minute intervals when comparing to data obtained by
    the LOCOS. Visual inspection and correlation indicated that all solar and wind
    data corresponded closely to the LOCOS solar radiation and wind records obtained
    at the experimental site. Daily reference evapotranspiration (ETr) data from the
    AHTI station was also downloaded. Linear regression was used to establish relationships
    between the calculated daily reference ET at each LOCOS and the daily ETr reported
    at AHTI. For periods when no data was obtained by the LOCOS, these linear regressions
    were used with AHTI daily ETr to interpolate the missing ETr values. These interpolated
    values were used only for computing cumulative seasonal total evaporation. 2.4.
    Vineyard disease study The second field was at a vineyard near Julieata, ID. The
    LOCOS were installed in three different vineyard blocks to study the role of micro-climatic
    effects on powdery mildew disease pressure. The 12-hectare vineyards are spread
    across steep slopes with different solar aspects and different varieties including
    Chardonnay, Riesling and Grenache and Syrah (Fig. 4). The objective of this study
    was to determine if there is variable powdery mildew pressure across the vineyards
    so that the farmer can optimize the timing, location, and intensity of pesticide
    application. Download : Download high-res image (548KB) Download : Download full-size

    and soil moisture characteristics on 5-minute intervals (Table 5). Stations were
    mounted on existing T-posts in the Chardonnay, Riesling, Grenache and Syrah varieties
    and are referred to as S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively (Fig. 5). Table 5. Weather

    The LOCOS stations S1, S2 and S3 collected data for a total of 135 days from 01
    May 2019 to 13 September 2019. S4 was installed on 08 May 2019 and ran for a total
    of 127 days. Some data was lost from technical failures, for example a missing
    pull-up resistor in one unit and lack of solar charge as the vineyard canopy grew
    over the solar panels. For gaps in records of individual stations, linear regression
    equations between individual stations and the other running stations were developed
    for every weather variable. The linear regression equations were weighted by the
    agreement of the time series such that missing data from one station would be
    filled using the station with the best fit data. Lagged correlation was used to
    develop linear regressions for S4 wind data from the other three stations to account
    for the decoupling in time from turbulent transfer across space. These weighted
    linear regression equations were then used to interpolate gaps in the data records.
    The percent of data interpolated due to the issues previously described is 13%,
    21%, 26%, and 9% for S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively. Data from each station was
    used to calculate the UC Davis IPM Powdery Mildew Risk Index (PMRI), which is
    a widely accepted tool used to inform fungicide application in vineyards (Choudhury
    et al., 2018). The PMRI is a weather based index used to estimate the growth rate
    of powdery mildew and provide an indicator of disease pressure (Gubler et al.,
    1999). The PMRI ranges from 0 to 100 and points are added and subtracted based
    on a temperature threshold. The index provides growers with a severity level for
    disease pressure (high, moderate, or low) that is associated with a recommended
    fungicide spray interval. The PMRI was calculated by smoothing the 5-minute data
    into a 6-hour running average using convolution. The primary infection began when
    three consecutive days had at least one 6-hour period of favorable temperatures
    (70–85°F), and the daily index was set to 60 points. Hereinafter, twenty points
    were added to the daily index if there was at least one 6-hour period within the
    favorable temperature range. If a day did not contain a 6-hour period within the
    favorable temperature range, or if temperatures exceeded 95°F for at least fifteen
    minutes, ten points were subtracted from the index. 2.5. Sensor calibration procedure
    A post-season calibration was done for all stations by placing them adjacent to
    a high quality, permanent weather station at the University of Idaho (Moscow,
    Idaho). The temperature and humidity measurements from the SHT-31 and ATMOS-41
    sensors on the LOCOS were compared to measurements from an Elektronic EE181 temperature
    and humidity sensor (Elektronik GmhH Engerwitzdorf, Austria). PWS maintenance
    occurs on a quarterly schedule including annual rotation, calibration, and occasional
    replacement of sensors such as the EE-181. The temperature and humidity readings
    from the EE-181 sensor are calibrated annually against a reference standard. The
    five LOCOS used in the irrigation study were calibrated for one week in September
    (9/17/19–9/24/19). During this period, air temperatures ranged from 4 to 25 °C,
    and relative humidity ranged from 30 to 98%. The four LOCOS used in the vineyard
    disease study were calibrated for one week in October (10/02/19–10/09/19). The
    air temperatures during this period ranged from −3 to 20 °C, and relative humidity
    ranged from 20 to 98%. Linear regressions between the lower cost sensor measurement
    and EE181 measurements were developed, and the regression coefficients were used
    to establish unique calibration equations for each sensor. 3. Results 3.1. Calibration
    results The calibration results from the ATMOS 41 temperature sensor were in near
    perfect agreement with the EE-181, with an average r-square of 0.998 (Table 6).
    The average RMSE of the four sensors was 0.23 °C, which is well within the uncertainty
    specified by the manufacturer (±0.6 °C). The relative humidity measurements from
    the ATMOS-41 were also in good agreement with the humidity measurement from the
    EE-181, with an average r-square of 0.972. However, the ATMOS-41 tended to overestimate
    the relative humidity for values above 70%. The average RMSE was 3.4 %RH, which
    exceeds the specified uncertainty of ±0.1%. Although the range of temperatures
    observed during calibration (−3 °C–20 °C) did not capture the full range of the
    sensor temperature specification (−40 °C–50 °C), it is assumed that the sensor
    performs linearly across the range of temperatures observed during the field experiment
    (−10 °C–45 °C). Table 6. Linear regression coefficients comparing ATMOS-41 and

    of 6–8% RH. The SHT-31 relative humidity measurement had similar calibration results
    as the ATMOS-41 RH measurement, with an average r-square of 0.960 and RMSE of
    3.82% (Table 7). The SHT-31 sensor overestimated air temperature by 16–18% in

    study The irrigation study demonstrated practical differences between evaporative
    demand (reference ET) between the fetch upwind and downwind of the two fields.
    The results show that there was less evaporative demand downwind from the LESA
    system than the conventional center pivot. Fig. 9 shows that the ETr downwind
    from the LESA field was indistinguishable from ETr at the center of the LESA field.
    Where with the conventional field, the ETr downwind was more than that of the
    center of the field. This indicates that there was more advected humidity from
    the LESA system than the conventional. This advective effect can equally be attributed
    to the LESA technology itself or to the actual rate of irrigation applied to this
    field. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Comparison of ETr from ASH stations and daily ETr reported at AHTI.
    Calculated using temperature and humidity data prior to calibration. Prior to
    sensor calibration, ETr calculated at ASH1 (upwind) was in extremely close correspondence
    with that reported at AHTI, summing to within 2% of season total, and a daily
    RMSE of ±0.5 mm (Fig. 9). With uncalibrated sensor data, there was no significant
    difference between ETr measured under the conventional and LESA center pivots,
    and ETr measured downwind of the conventional center pivot was indistinguishable
    from the upwind station. The station downwind of the LESA pivot measured similar
    ETr to the two stations located within the irrigated fields. Post-season calibration
    of the temperature and relative humidity data resulted in different calculated
    values of evaporative demand at the LESA and conventional center pivots (Fig.
    10). Linear regressions between each of the SHT-31 sensors and the corresponding
    sensor on the permanent weather station were used to calibrate the LOCOS sensor
    data and post-process the reference ET calculations (Table 7). Calibration of
    temperature and humidity data significantly altered the station-to-station differences
    observed in calculated ETr (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image
    (266KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Correlation between daily
    ETr calculated from CALIBRATED field weather station data, compared to daily ETr
    reported by nearby Agrimet station AHTI. ETr values at both the upwind station
    (ASH1, black markers) and the station downwind of the conventional pinot (ASH5,
    magenta markers) average 10% lower than ETr reported by Agrimet at AHTI. At the
    two stations within the fields, ETr over the course of the season is 14% (ASH3,
    conventional pivot) and 17% lower (ASH4, LESA pivot) than AHTI. Downwind of the
    LESA pivot ETr values were 18% lower than reported at AHTI. Depression in reference
    ET is primarily related to increased humidity and to a lesser extent depressed
    air temperature; it should be noted that lower reference ET does not indicate
    a lower level of actual evapotranspiration, only a reduction in evaporative demand
    related to the energy available at the land surface. If there is a downwind effect
    resulting from advected humidity, it appears that the LESA pivot is contributing
    more advected humidity to the downwind station than is the conventional pivot,
    contradicting the hypothesized effect that the LESA''s reduced wind drift might
    increase evaporative demand downwind of the pivot. In other words, the station
    of the conventional pivot is more similar to the upwind conditions, and the station
    downwind of the LESA pivot is more similar to the in-field, irrigated condition.
    The daily ETr values for the five stations and AHTI are shown in Fig. 11. Aside
    from AHTI consistently reporting higher ET than the five stations, the evident
    feature is that daily variability in ETr (3–9 mm/day), which is common to all
    stations, exceeds the station-to-station variability. Differences between the
    evaporative demand between irrigated and non-irrigated areas, much less between
    irrigation systems, are an order of magnitude smaller than the total evaporative
    demand in most periods. Download : Download high-res image (330KB) Download :

    was 40 mm greater than the downwind stations. ETr estimated at the center of the

    study results Observations from the LOCOS show three distinct micro-climates with
    S2 being the coolest and windiest, S4 being the hottest and least windy, and S1
    and S3 being somewhere in between with indistinguishable differences. In general,
    differences in temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed between the stations
    were greatest during the day and in the early part of the season, from May 1st
    – June 30th. The most notable differences in weather were observed between S4
    and S2 (Fig. 13). S4 had warmer daytime temperatures than the other three stations,
    and the minimum temperature was more than 5 °C greater than the other three stations
    in the early part of the season, (Fig. 12A). S2 was generally the coolest station.
    These trends did not persist into the later part of the season (July – September).
    After July, all stations appeared to have very similar temperature distributions

    14A). The greatest difference was between S4 and the other three stations, where
    S4 rarely exceeded 83% relative humidity. Station to station comparison show that
    wind speeds at S2 are generally higher than the other stations, and S4 generally
    had much lower wind speeds than the other stations (Fig. 15A). Differences prevailed
    throughout the later part of the season, though not as dramatic (Fig. 15B). Download

    growing season and across the different locations (Fig. 16). In general, the highest
    disease pressure occurred in early May and again in June through July. All stations
    fell below the high disease pressure threshold through-out August. The greatest
    variability in PMRI between stations occurred in June, which is consistent with
    the observed variability in weather data. In July, S1, S2 and S3 consistently
    stayed above the high disease pressure threshold. However, S4 continued to have
    lower disease pressure than the other three stations through-out august which
    is not obvious when looking at the late season weather data alone (Fig. 13B, Fig.
    14B, and Fig. 15B). PMRI results from S4 indicate that a bi-weekly fungicide application
    is recommended in June, weekly in July, and in August a three-week spray schedule
    would suffice. In comparison, a weekly fungicide application schedule is recommended
    for the S2 block starting as early as May, and a 21-day interval is appropriate
    after August (Fig. 17). Download : Download high-res image (214KB) Download :

    support The data collected by the LOCOS in the two different field studies provided
    information on field variability that was relevant to management decisions. In
    the vineyard study, observations from LOCOS showed at least three distinct microclimates
    across the vineyard that have different susceptibility to powdery mildew disease:
    the S1 and S3 block, the S2 block, and the S4 block. These weather data can be
    put into action by use of the PMRI, which provides real-time recommendations on
    the frequency, intensity, and location of fungicide application. The PMRI varied
    significantly between station locations, and throughout the season. This suggests
    that different vineyard blocks could benefit from unique spray schedules rather
    than applying the same disease management strategy to the entire operation. With
    this spatially resolved information, the farm manager can make better educated
    decisions on when and where to commit resources for disease controls. The five
    LOCOS in the irrigation study were able to show differences in evaporative demand
    between the upwind and downwind fetch of the irrigated barley fields. There was
    less evaporative demand downwind from the LESA system than the conventional center
    pivot, which indicates that there was more advected humidity from the LESA system
    than the conventional. This contradicts the expectation that reference ET should
    be higher downwind from the LESA system, resulting from lower humidity and greater
    vapor pressure deficit related to reduction in wind losses. However, if the observation
    is correct, the advection effect is as equally likely to result from the actual
    rate of irrigation applied, than it is related to the LESA technology itself.
    Nonetheless, the LOCOS were robust enough to test scientific hypotheses, and information
    obtained from this study will help water resource managers in Fremont County make
    more informed recommendations on center pivot technologies. 4.2. Sensor comparison
    Results from the sensor calibration show that the sensors on the LOCOS (SHT-31
    and ATMOS-41) were in good agreement with the high-quality meteorology instrument
    (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The ATMOS-41 temperature sensor had a nearly identical response
    as the EE-181 temperature measurement. Due to design constraints the ATMOS-41
    temperature sensor was not contained in a radiation shield as typically required
    for air temperature measurements. The sensor is partially exposed to radiation
    resulting in measurement errors. However, because the ATMOS-41 also measures solar
    radiation and wind speed, the instrument performs a correction using a simple
    energy balance (https://www.metergroup.com/environment/articles/atmos-41-correction-air-temperature-measurements-radiation-exposed-sensor/).
    The positive results of this calibration indicate that this correction is sufficient
    to regain a precise air temperature measurement. The SHT-31 temperature measurement
    also performed well in comparison to the EE-181 sensor, however some sensor bias
    was observed (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). The SHT-31 sensors tended to overestimate the temperature
    and underestimate the relative humidity. The average RMSE of the five sensors
    was 1.08 °C, which is substantially greater than the specified sensor uncertainty
    of ± 0.3 °C. However, the error was disproportionately distributed during daytime
    hours (Fig. 8), suggesting that the sensor bias may not be attributed to the sensor
    itself, but the radiation shield. Gunawardena et al. (2018) came to the same conclusion
    when comparing an SHT 15 temperature and relative humidity sensor (SHT 15; Sensirion,
    ZH, Switzerland) sensor to an HMP 45 (HMP 45; Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    Utah). A study on the effectiveness of low-cost radiation shields found that temperature
    error was greatest during the day, particularly during periods with low wind speed
    and radiation above 600 W/m2 (Tarara and Hoheisel, 2007). This error is attributed
    to lack of convective and radiative heat transfer in lower quality radiation shield
    designs. Although the SHT-31 measurements were not in perfect agreement with the
    EE-181, the inter-sensor agreement of the five SHT-31 sensors was strong with
    an average r-square between sensors of 0.998. This suggests that the sensor bias
    could be corrected in all sensors using a single linear regression equation. Similarly,
    Bakker (2002) showed that one calibration equation was able to provide robust
    accuracy for a batch of 10 CMOS temperature sensors. The results from the irrigation
    study highlight the importance of calibrating low-cost sensors prior to use, and
    a batch calibration would greatly reduce the time commitment associated with sensor
    calibration. A simple and feasible pre- and post-season calibration procedure
    could be prescribed as part of on-farm monitoring programs. Such a procedure could
    be as simple as co-locating batches of sensors for a period of 5–10 days at a
    permanent weather station operated by one of the regional networks. This kind
    of cooperative effort enables extension and research professionals to contribute
    directly to on-farm efforts, and is a good example of co-generation of knowledge
    (Nocco et al., 2020, Prokopy et al., 2017). 4.3. Identify improvements for LOCOS
    design The LOCOS operated 81% of the time in the vineyard study, and 68% of the
    time in the irrigation study. We highlight three primary areas for improvement
    in the LOCOS design: improving datalogger reliability, power system reliability,
    and the ease of use for operators. First, the RTC communication caused errors
    in both field studies. Reliable communication with the RTC is paramount for dependable
    operation of dataloggers. This is especially salient when using the low power
    library, which relies on the RTC to wake the microcontroller up to take a measurement.
    The error was found to be due to a floating pin on the RTC, which can cause intermittent,
    and unpredictable malfunctions in the system. Although this mistake was found
    and solved early in the season by adding a pull-up resistor, it highlights the
    technicality of building, operating, and maintaining these open-source systems.
    Secondly, mid-season data drop-outs during the vineyard study were due to canopy
    growth covering the solar panels. In this case light pruning of the plant canopy
    allowed for sufficient sunlight, though it highlights the sensitivity of solar
    powered systems. Such power failures may contribute to the lack of trust growers
    have in on-farm weather stations, and it should be noted that solar power may
    not be suitable for all operations, locations, and times of year. Lastly, Agricultural
    collaborators found that one of the major challenges when operating the LOCOS
    was that downloading data from the SD card while in the field was inconvenient
    and error prone. As such, a major opportunity for improvement of the LOCOS is
    development of a wireless data transmission feature. It should be noted that remote
    data collection requires higher processing capacity and increases power consumption,
    and as such it may not always be a feasible feature to add to the system. These
    challenges are important to recognize, as the additional time required to troubleshoot
    and re-configure DIY low-cost environmental monitoring systems may inhibit people
    from using these technologies as an option for on-farm decision support. 5. Conclusion
    These case studies of low-cost, distributed weather stations demonstrate benefits
    of site-specific information in decision support and optimization of farm practices.
    By establishing acceptable accuracy and robustness, low-cost systems can play
    a larger role in monitoring a wide array of site conditions. Affordable on-farm
    sensors enable farmers to use rigorous science-based methods that reduce resource
    consumption and costs, prevent and reduce risks to productivity, while maintaining
    or increasing crop yield and quality. Expanding on this work, the LOCOS will be
    deployed in a hazelnut orchard to collect data on near canopy weather and leaf
    temperature, with the goal of using distributed LOCOS to better inform irrigation
    events. As precision agriculture technologies and products become more prevalent,
    site-specific information becomes increasingly useful, and real-time data are
    required to maximize the potential benefits attributed to precision technology.

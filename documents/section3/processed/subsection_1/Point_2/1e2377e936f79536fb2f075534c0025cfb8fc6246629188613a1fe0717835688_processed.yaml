    \ forms a critical activity vital to the survival of \nhumanity for approximately\
    \ many thousands of years [1].This \nrelationship has resulted in the advancement\
    \ of agricultural \nactivities, initially through the time-consuming methods of\
    \ \ntraditional agriculture [2]. The current recent rapid increase in \nin the\
    \ global population (predicted to rise to 8.9 billion by \n2050) has now led to\
    \ an urgent need to balance demand and \nsupply through the use of new technologies\
    \ [3] to increase food \nproduction [4, 5]. This development places pressure on\
    \ natural \nresources, with agriculture now consuming 70% of the world‟s \nfresh\
    \ water supply for the purposes of irrigation. Limited \nresources and the impact\
    \ of climate change will therefore lead \nto considerable challenges in producing\
    \ sufficient high quality \nfood to support the population [6]. Smart Agricultural\
    \ is a \nglobal initiative to preserve resources and maintain sustainable \nagriculture\
    \ [7]. Recently, researchers have adopted the Internet \nof Things (IoT) [8, 9],\
    \ with a number of studies emphasizing \nthe adoption and implementation of IoT\
    \ in agriculture, \nfarming, and irrigation [10]. Around the globe, many private\
    \ \ncompanies and organizations are now focusing on investigating \nnew technologies\
    \ to create a smarter agriculture environment. \nThese include mechanical and\
    \ economic aspects, engineering, \nfood retailers and computing. However, agricultural\
    \ processes \nare fragmented, resulting in a number of issues, i.e. difficulties\
    \ \nin operating and managing smart machines, data sharing and \nmanagement, data\
    \ analysis and storage [11, 12]. It is therefore \nimportant to facilitate cooperation\
    \ when developing standards \nfor smart agriculture, while also enhancing interoperability\
    \ \namong different stakeholders, systems and technologies [13]. \nThe use of\
    \ IoT and AI technologies has the potential to \nresult in a positive transformation\
    \ of traditional agriculture [3], \nincluding: (a) improved use of data collected\
    \ from smart \nagriculture sensors; (b) managing and governing the internal \n\
    processes within the smart agriculture environment (including \nthe management\
    \ of the harvesting and storage of crops); (c) \nwaste reduction and cost saving;\
    \ (d) increasing business \nefficiency by means of automating traditional processes;\
    \ and \n(e) improving the quality and volume of products [14]. A major \nchallenge\
    \ is to provide farmers with the required information in \na rapid manner [15].\
    \ AI therefore has significant potential to \naddress the urgent challenges faced\
    \ by traditional agriculture. \nThere has, over previous decades, been considerable\
    \ research \nand application of AI, including in: (a) smart agriculture; (b) \n\
    robotics; (c) agricultural optimization management; (d) \nautomation; (e) agricultural\
    \ expert systems; (f) agricultural \nknowledge-based systems; and (g) decision\
    \ support systems \n[16]. \nThere remains a lack of research and development in\
    \ \nrelation to Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied \nby complex\
    \ obstacles arising from the fragmentation of \nagricultural processes, i.e. the\
    \ control and operation of IoT/AI \nmachines; data sharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and \nlarge amounts of generated data analysis and storage. \nTherefore, this\
    \ study firstly, explores existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies adopted for SSA and secondly,\
    \ establishes an \nIoT/AI technical architecture to underpin SSA platforms, in\
    \ \norder to tackle fragmentation in traditional agriculture \nprocesses and enrich\
    \ the research and development of future \nsmart agriculture worldwide via establishment\
    \ of a Smart, \nSustainable Agriculture platform as a solution. \nThere now follows\
    \ an outline of the methodology \nunderpinning this research, supported by related\
    \ work \nhighlighting the history of smart agriculture, smart and \nadvanced computing\
    \ technologies and examples of IoT/AI \ntechnologies in current agricultural practices.\

    \ \nby an in-depth discussion of Smart Agriculture and IoT/AI \nSSA technical\
    \ architecture, along with the most significant \noutcomes from this study. The\
    \ paper finishes with concluding \nremarks and plans for future work. \nII. BACKGROUND\
    \ \nDue to the lack of literature concerning the development of \nIoT frameworks\
    \ for SSA, this study focuses on: (a) the history \nof smart agriculture, its\
    \ potential and challenges; (b) smart and \nadvanced computing technologies; and\
    \ (c) existing smart, \nsustainable agricultural frameworks. \nA. Smart Sustainable\
    \ Agriculture \nThere has recently been considerable research into SSA, \nemploying\
    \ various different terms, including Precision \nFarming, Smart Irrigation and\
    \ Smart Greenhouse. This paper \ncommences with an examination of these concepts\
    \ to \ndetermine the definition of SSA used in this study. \nPrecision Farming\
    \ refers to a method of managing farms \nand conserving resources through the\
    \ use of IoT and \nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT). It \nobtains\
    \ real-time data concerning the condition of farm \nelements, (i.e. crops, soil\
    \ and air) to protect the environment \nwhile ensuring profits and sustainability\
    \ [15]. Smart Irrigation \nis a method of improving the efficiency of irrigation\
    \ processes \nand reducing water losses, while conserving existing water \nresources\
    \ using IoT-based smart irrigation systems [16]. \nDrones are employed in many\
    \ agricultural applications, \nincluding monitoring field crops and livestock,\
    \ and scanning \nlarge areas, while sensors on the ground collect a huge range\
    \ of \ninformation [13]. Smart greenhouses promote the cultivation of \ncrops\
    \ with the least degree of human intervention possible, \nthrough use of continuously\
    \ monitored climatic conditions (i.e. \nhumidity, \ntemperature, luminosity \n\
    and \nsoil \nmoisture), \ntriggering automated actions based on the evaluated\
    \ changes \nand implementing corrective action to maintain the most \nbeneficial\
    \ conditions for growth [17]. \nFarm Management Systems (FMS) can assist farmers\
    \ with \na variety of collected information, by managing and controlling \nvarious\
    \ \ntracking \ndevices \nand \nsensors. \nThe \ncollected \ninformation is analysed\
    \ for the undertaking of complex \ndecision-making tasks before being placed in\
    \ a storage \nmedium. This enables the use of the most effective agricultural\
    \ \ndata analysis practices [18]. Soil Monitoring Systems help to \ntrack and\
    \ improve the quality of soil through the monitoring of \nits physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological properties. Livestock \nmonitoring systems provide real-time\
    \ assessment of the \nproductivity, health and welfare of livestock, to promote\
    \ the \nhealth of animals [19]. The IoT/AI SSA platform Cloud offers \nreal-time\
    \ information to farmers to facilitate decision-making \nand reduce operational\
    \ costs, while at the same time enhancing \nproductivity. Following a review of\
    \ a considerable amount of \nresearch, we define SSA as the utilization process\
    \ of IoT/AI \ntechnologies to establish, monitor, manage, process and \nanalyse\
    \ data generated from various agricultural resources, \nsuch as field, crops,\
    \ livestock and others to ensure the \nsustainability and quality of agricultural\
    \ products and further \nenrich decision-making taken by stakeholders. \nB. Smart\
    \ and Advanced Computing Technologies \nThis section provides an overview of appropriate\
    \ \ntechnologies \nunderpinning \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nsmart, \nsustainable\
    \ agriculture platforms, including: IoT; Big Data \nAnalytics (BDA); Cloud Computing\
    \ (CC); Mobile Computing \n(MC); and Artificial Intelligence (AI): \n1) Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT): IoT is a technology aimed at \nconnecting all intelligent objects\
    \ within a single network, i.e. \nthe Internet. It involves all kinds of computer\
    \ technologies, \nboth (a) hardware (i.e. intelligent boards and sensors) and\
    \ \n(b) software (i.e. advanced operating systems and AI \nalgorithms). Its primary\
    \ target is the establishment of \napplications for devices, in order to enable\
    \ the monitoring and \ncontrol of a specific domain. It has been widely adopted\
    \ in \nmany areas, i.e. industrial business processes; home machines; \nhealth\
    \ applications; and smart homes and cities. IoT \nconnectivity encompasses people,\
    \ machines, tools and \nlocations, aiming to achieve different intelligent functions\
    \ from \ndata sharing and information exchange [17]. However, it is \nprimarily\
    \ used in agriculture for management of agricultural \nproducts \nwithin \ngathered\
    \ \nreal-time \ndata, \nalongside: \n(1) searching; (2) tracking; (3) monitoring;\
    \ (4) control; (5) \nmanaging; (6) evaluating; and (7) operations within a supply\
    \ \nchain [1, 9]. \n2) Big Data Analytics (BDA): BDA refers to the large \nvolume\
    \ of data gathered from different datasets sources over a \nlong period of time,\
    \ i.e. sensor, Internet and business data. The \ndatasets used in this technology\
    \ surpass the computational and \nanalytical capabilities of typical software\
    \ applications and \nstandard database infrastructure. Its primary task is to\
    \ capture, \nstore, analyze and search for data, as well as seeking to identify\
    \ \nconcealed patterns in the gathered data. Thus, BDA involved \nthe utilization\
    \ of: (a) tools, (i.e. classification and clustering); \n(b) techniques, (i.e.\
    \ data mining, machine learning and \nstatistical analysis); and (c) technologies\
    \ (i.e. Hadoop and \nspark). These go beyond traditional data analytical approaches,\
    \ \nbeing employed to extract beneficial knowledge from a \nconsiderable amount\
    \ of data, in order to facilitate timely and \naccurate decision–making [17].\
    \ However, the use of BDA in \nagriculture focusses on management of the supply\
    \ chain of \nagricultural products, in order to enhance decision-making and \n\
    minimize the cost of production cost. It is also employed for \nthe analysis of\
    \ the properties of different types of soil for \nclassification and further enhancement.\
    \ Furthermore, it is \nuseful for the improved prediction and production of crops.\
    \ \n3) Cloud Computing (CC): CC has is a recent and rapidly \ngrowing phenomenon\
    \ within IT [18]. The Cloud is not \nrestricted to a particular business domain,\
    \ but has been \nimplemented to underpin and support various software \napplications\
    \ and platforms [19]. It offers easy access to the \nCloud provider‟s high-performance\
    \ and storage infrastructure \nover the Internet, with one of its main benefits\
    \ being to conceal \nfrom users the complexity of IT infrastructure management\
    \ \n[20] [21]. NIST [22] defined CC as “a model for enabling \nconvenient, on-demand\
    \ network access to a shared pool of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n95 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nconfigurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers,\
    \ \nstorage, applications and services) that can be rapidly \nprovisioned and\
    \ released with minimal management effort or \nservice provider interaction”.\
    \ The Cloud can be seen as high \nvirtualization method for datacenter infrastructure\
    \ distributed \nover a wide geographical area, linked by means of high \nbandwidth\
    \ network cables providing a variety of virtualized \nservices. These include\
    \ entire infrastructures, as well as small \nsoftware applications and different\
    \ types of services, i.e. high-\nperformance computing and large scalable storage\
    \ services \nbased on a pay-per-use model. CC can be divided into four \nmain\
    \ layers: (1) hardware; (2) infrastructure; (3) platform; and \n(4) application\
    \ [23]. The delivery of Cloud services can \ngenerally be divided into three different\
    \ models: (1) \nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS); (2) Platform-as-a-Service\
    \ \n(PaaS); and (3) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) [24, 25]. CC is \nconsidered\
    \ the most effective method of storing agricultural \ndata, along with IoT [1].\
    \ \n4) Mobile Computing (MC): MC refers to infrastructure in \nwhich data processing\
    \ and data storage take place externally to \nthe mobile device [26]. MC applications\
    \ transfer computing \npower, processing and data storage from mobile devices\
    \ in the \nCloud [27, 28]. MC has had a considerable impact on modern \ndaily\
    \ life, due to the availability and low cost of purchasing and \ncommunication.\
    \ It is now widely used in every field, including \nthe agricultural sector [29],\
    \ in which MC systems collect and \nsend daily data to farmers, informing them\
    \ of both the \nproduction status and weather conditions [29]. It is crucial to\
    \ \nuse automatic Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) efficient \ntraceability\
    \ systems to store and access data on electronic data \nchips in a more rapid\
    \ and accurate manner. It has been \nprimarily applied to the logistics of industrial\
    \ products, for the \npurposes of identification and to check delivery processes\
    \ [30]. \n5) Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI has been employed in \nsmart systems\
    \ over a long period of time[31], being the science \nof creating intelligent\
    \ machines to facilitate everyday life [32]. \nAI covers many areas, including\
    \ computer vision, data mining, \ndeep learning, image processing and neural networks\
    \ [16, 33]. \nAI technologies are now emerging to assist and improve \nefficiency\
    \ and tackle many of the challenges facing the \nagricultural industry, including\
    \ soil health, crop yield and \nherbicide-resistance. According to Sennaar [34],\
    \ agricultural \nAI Cloud applications fall into three main categories, as \n\
    discussed below. \na) Robots: these are developed and programmed to \nhandle fundamental\
    \ agricultural tasks (i.e. harvesting crops) \nmore rapidly and with a higher\
    \ capacity than human workers. \nExamples of robotic applications include: (a)\
    \ See and Spray \n(i.e. a weed control robot) and (b) Harvest CROO (i.e. a crop\
    \ \nharvesting robot). Agricultural robots have the potential to \nbecome valuable\
    \ AI applications, i.e. milking robots. \nb) Monitoring Crop and Soil: this employs\
    \ computer \nvision and deep-learning algorithms for processing captured \ndata\
    \ by sensors monitoring crop and soil health, i.e. the PEAT \nmachine for diagnosing\
    \ pests and soil defects, based on deep \nlearning application known as Plantix\
    \ that identifies potential \ndefects and nutrient deficiencies in the soil. A\
    \ further example \nis Trace Genomics, a machine learning based service for \n\
    diagnosing soil defects and providing soil analysis services to \nfarmers. This\
    \ uses machine learning to provide farmers with a \nsense of both the strengths\
    \ and weaknesses of their soil, with \nthe emphasis being on the prevention of\
    \ poor crops and \noptimizing the potential for healthy crop production. A \n\
    SkySquirrel technology is an example of the use of drones and \ncomputer vision\
    \ for crop analysis. \nc) Predictive Analytics: This analysis captured data, \n\
    based on machine learning models capable of tracking and \npredicting various\
    \ environmental impacts on crop harvest, i.e. \nchanges in weather. Examples of\
    \ such AI technologies include \n(a) aWhere (i.e. prediction of weather and crop\
    \ sustainability) \nand (b) Farmshots (i.e. monitoring of crop health and \nsustainability).\
    \ Crop and soil monitoring technologies are \nimportant applications for addressing\
    \ issues related to climate \nchange. IoT/AI technologies (such as drone and satellite)\
    \ that \ngenerate a large amount of data on a daily basis have the \npotential\
    \ to enable agricultural production to forecast changes \nand detect opportunities.\
    \ It is predicted that, over the coming \nyears, IoT and AI applications will\
    \ attract a considerable \ndegree of interest from large industrial agricultural\
    \ enterprises \n[34]. \nThe benefits and advantages of the agricultural use of\
    \ IoT \nare as follows: (a) efficiency of input; (b) cost reduction; \n(c) profitability;\
    \ (d) sustainability; (e) food safety and \nenvironmental protection [35]. However,\
    \ Ferrández-Pastor, et \nal. [36] considered SSA to contain a number of barriers\
    \ \npotentially hindering its adoption: (a) initial expectations and \nadvantages\
    \ remaining unfulfilled; (b) complexity of technology \nand incompatibility of\
    \ components; (c) a lack of products; and \n(d) the high cost involved in the\
    \ establishment and \nmaintenance of such facilities. To ensure the adoption and\
    \ \nimprovement of smart technologies in the agriculture sector, it \nis vital\
    \ for farmers to be trained and given up-to-date \nknowledge of IoT/AI technologies.\
    \ Furthermore, it is crucial to \ntest and validate IoT/AI applications, due to\
    \ the high risk \ninvolved in the adoption of these technologies in a critical\
    \ \nsector, along with the influence of environmental factors. \nC. Examples of\
    \ IoT/AI Technologies in Current Agriculture \nPractices \nThere are many types\
    \ of IoT and AI sensors and \napplications in current agricultural studies and\
    \ development. \nTable 1 provides an overview of the most commonly employed \n\
    IoT/AI platforms/technologies found in smart agriculture. \nD. Examples of an\
    \ Existing AI/IoT Research in Smart \nAgriculture \nThere are a number of specific\
    \ challenges that need to be \nconsidered before investing in smart agriculture,\
    \ primarily \nthose falling into the following categories: (1) hardware; \n(2)\
    \ data analysis; (3) maintenance; (4) mobility; and \n(5) infrastructure [56].\
    \ Nonetheless, there are many research \nefforts in the field of IoT/AI to support\
    \ the creation and \nestablishment of SSA, as shown in Table 2. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \nTABLE II. \nIOT/AI RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SMART SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE\
    \ \nResearcher/s \nYear \nSummary \nRay [57] \n2017 \nThe researchers undertook\
    \ a review of various potential IoT applications, including the specific issues\
    \ and challenges associated \nwith IoT deployment to improve farming. They comprehensively\
    \ analyzed the specific requirements the devices and wireless \ncommunication\
    \ technologies associated with agricultural IoT applications. They presented different\
    \ case studies to explore existing \nIoT based solutions operated by various organizations\
    \ and individuals, followed by categorizing them based on their deployment \n\
    parameters. Furthermore, they identified a number of factors for the improvement\
    \ and future road map of work using IoT. \nMekala and \nViswanathan [58] \n2017\
    \ \nThe researchers surveyed a number of conventional applications of Agricultural\
    \ IoT Sensor Monitoring Network technologies \nutilizing CC. Their study aimed\
    \ at understanding the diverse technologies to build smart, sustainable agriculture.\
    \ They addressed a \nsimple IoT agriculture model with a wireless network. \n\
    Kamilaris, et al. \n[59] \n2017 \nThe researchers reviewed work in agriculture\
    \ employing the practice of big data analysis to solve various different problems.\
    \ \nTheir review emphasized the opportunities provided by big data analysis for\
    \ the development of smarter agriculture, the availability of \nhardware and software,\
    \ as well as the techniques and methods for big data analysis. \nRajeswari, et\
    \ al. \n[29] \n2017 \nThe researchers investigated a number of different features,\
    \ i.e. humidity, temperature sensing, server-based remote monitoring \nsystem\
    \ detection and soil moisture sensing. They used sensor networks to measure temperature,\
    \ moisture and humidity in place of \nmanual checking. They deployed several sensors\
    \ in different locations within farms, using a single controller. Their major\
    \ objective \nwas to collect real-time data of the agriculture production environment\
    \ to establish an easy access agricultural advice, in order to \nidentify weather\
    \ or crops patterns. \nAntonacci, et al. \n[5] \n2018 \nThe researchers attempted\
    \ to provide nanotechnology-based (bio) sensors to support farmers in delivering\
    \ an analysis that is \naccurate, fast, cost-effective, and useful in the field\
    \ to identify water and soil nutrients/pesticides, soil humidity, and plant pathogens.\
    \ \nCadavid, et al. \n[60] \n2018 \nThe researchers proposed an extension to a\
    \ popular open-source IoT platform, known as „Thingsboard‟. This formed the core\
    \ of a \nCloud-based Smart Farming platform and deliberate sensors, a decision\
    \ support system, and a configuration of remotely autonomous \nand controlled\
    \ machines (e.g. water dispensers, rovers or drones). \nSoto-Romero, et \nal.\
    \ [61] \n2019 \nThe researchers designed an easily insertable cylindrical sensor\
    \ with internal electronics to offer a low power electronic \narchitecture to\
    \ measure and communicate wirelessly with a LoRa, Sigfox network or mobile phones.\
    \ \nNóbrega, et al. \n[62] \n2019 \nThe researchers reviewed the proposed stack\
    \ and details of the recent developments within smart agriculture, focusing on\
    \ \nIoT/Machine-2-Machine interaction. They described the design and deployment\
    \ of a gateway addressing the requirements of the \nSheepIT service, evaluating\
    \ this gateway using real scenarios in terms of performance, thus demonstrating\
    \ its feasibility and \nscalability. \nIII. METHODOLOGY \nAs well as undertaking\
    \ the literature review, the current \nresearcher enhanced this study by informally\
    \ interviewing \nexperienced farmers. The study aims to establish an IoT/AI \n\
    SSA architecture, as well as exploring the potential of the use \nof IoT and AI\
    \ as a backbone to establish an SSA platform. A \nreview was employed to identify,\
    \ analyze and study key books, \njournals, reports, and white papers, in order\
    \ to achieve the \nabove-noted aim. The lack of existing studies in this area\
    \ \nensures that this current research also contributes to the body of \nknowledge\
    \ by establishing an IoT/AI framework for the \nadoption of smart technologies,\
    \ in order to establish smart \nsustainable \nagricultural \npractices. \nFig.\
    \ \n1 \nshows \nthe \nmethodology adopted for this study. \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\
    \ \nBased on the research aim outlined in the Methodology, \nthis section is divided\
    \ into (A) Domains of Smart Sustainable \nagricultural model; (B) B. Proposed\
    \ IOT/AI SSA platform as a \nsolution; and (C) Proposed IoT/AI technical architecture\
    \ for \nSSA platform. \nA. Domains of Smart Sustainable Agricultural Model \n\
    The results from the literature review revealed that several \ndomains need to\
    \ be considered when adopting the smart \nagricultural model. Fig. 2 demonstrates\
    \ the interrelation and \ncomplexity of data flow between different Smart, Sustainable\
    \ \nAgriculture domains. \n \nFig. 1. IoT/SSA Research Methodology. \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\

    \ Data Flow and Interrelation of SSA Domains. \nThese domains are discussed individually,\
    \ as follows: \n Human resources: This refers to people, policies and \npractices\
    \ within the agricultural environment, which are \nas important as in any other\
    \ domain, as are weather and \ntechnology. Human resources receive careful attention,\
    \ \ndue to their significant impact on production, as well as \nfinancial and\
    \ marketing decisions. Whatever its size, an \nagricultural concern requires effective\
    \ human resources \nmanagement and planning, including hiring and \nkeeping employees\
    \ who are engaged, high-performing \nand effective communicators. Providing up-to-date\
    \ \nknowledge potentially opens the means to adopt smart \ntechnologies in an\
    \ agricultural environment. \n Crops: This refers to a plant that can be grown\
    \ and \nharvested extensively for subsistence or profit: (1) food \ncrops (i.e.\
    \ for human consumption); (2) feed crops (i.e. \nfor livestock consumption); (3)\
    \ fibre crops (i.e. for \ncordage and textiles); and (4) oil crops (i.e. for \n\
    consumption or industrial uses). \n Weather: This plays a major role in determining\
    \ the \nsuccess of agricultural processes. Most field crops and \nlivestock are\
    \ solely dependent on climactic conditions \nto provide life-sustaining water\
    \ and energy. Adverse \nweather can cause losses in agricultural products, \n\
    particularly during critical stages of growth. The \nelements of weather (solar\
    \ radiation, temperature, \nprecipitation, humidity and wind) influence the \n\
    physiology and production of agricultural plants and \nanimals. Severe weather\
    \ (i.e. tornadoes, drought, \nflooding, hail and wind storms) can cause considerable\
    \ \ndamage and destruction to fields and livestock. \n Soil: This forms a critical\
    \ aspect of successful \nagriculture, being the source of nutrients used to grow\
    \ \ncrops, which are subsequently passed into plants and \nthen to humans and\
    \ animals. Healthy soils produce \nhealthy and rich food supplies; however the\
    \ health of \nsoil tends to decline over time, forcing farmers to move \nto new\
    \ fields. Soil health depends on regional \nconditions and climates, with soil\
    \ nutrients more likely \nto deteriorate in dry climates, particularly if irrigated,\
    \ \nwhich, if not managed carefully, can result in \nsalinization, i.e. a build-up\
    \ in the level of salts and \nchemicals contained in water. Healthy and rich soil\
    \ can \nbe achieved through the use of IoT sensors to monitor \nits chemical status,\
    \ using specific sensors (e.g. moisture \nsensors), whose data readings are transferred\
    \ to the data \nmanagement and analysis layer for analysis, assisting \ndecisions\
    \ concerning the need for fertilizer. \n Pests: These consist of any living creature\
    \ that is \ninvasive, or damaging to crops, livestock or human \nstructures. Pests\
    \ often occur in high quantities, to the \ndetriment of agricultural products.\
    \ It is vital to control \nand monitor these creatures by means of IoT/AI \ntechnologies,\
    \ to avoid serious diseases, including \nplague and malaria, as well as plant\
    \ and livestock \ndiseases. \n Fertilization: Soils naturally contain many nutrients,\
    \ \ni.e. nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium and potassium. \nCrops are unable to function\
    \ effectively and produce \nhigh quality food when their nutrient level is low.\
    \ The \nnatural levels of nutrients in the soil need to be \nenhanced by the addition\
    \ of nutrients once crops have \nbeen harvested. Fertilizers have been used since\
    \ the \nbeginning of agriculture, but it is now recognized that \ntheir extensive\
    \ use can, if not correctly controlled, harm \nthe environment. Therefore, farmers\
    \ use IoT sensors to \nread and test soil samples for baseline testing to enable\
    \ \nthem to add fertilizers using correct and appropriate \nmeasurements. Fertilization\
    \ is an important method of \nmaintaining \nsustainable \nagricultural \nproduction\
    \ \nsystems. \n Agricultural Products: These are derived from \ncultivating crops\
    \ or livestock to sustain or enhance \nhuman life. Human beings also use a wide\
    \ collection of \nagricultural products on a daily basis, i.e. food and \nclothing.\
    \ Agricultural products fall into the following \ngroups: (a) grains; (b) foods;\
    \ (c) fuels; (d) fibres; \n(e) livestock; and (f) raw materials. Food is the most\
    \ \nextensively produced agricultural product. \n Irrigation/Water: Water demand\
    \ in agriculture is now \nrising globally and particularly in Mediterranean \n\
    countries, increasing the pressure to preserve available \nfreshwater resources.\
    \ Smart, sustainable agriculture \nprocesses should therefore focus on new and\
    \ efficient \ntechniques to improve agricultural productivity, which \npromote\
    \ considerable savings in terms of food \nconsumption and wasted water. \n Livestock:\
    \ These are animals raised in a domesticated \nagricultural environment, for the\
    \ purposes of labour and \nto produce commodities such as eggs, meat, milk, fur,\
    \ \nwool and leather. Animal husbandry is a component of \ncurrent agriculture\
    \ and refers to the breeding, \nmaintenance and slaughter of livestock. \n Machines:\
    \ Agricultural equipment is any kind of \nmachinery used to assist with farming.\
    \ Such machines \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n99 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \ncan be light or heavy, i.e. tractors. Modern farm \nmachinery is seen as the\
    \ important driver for increased \nagricultural \nsustainability, \nefficiency\
    \ \nand \ncompetitiveness. Smart technologies can reduce the \nimpact of farming\
    \ practices within global agriculture. \nThe current development of agricultural\
    \ machinery \naddresses environmental challenges, while increasing \nproductivity\
    \ and bringing economic benefits. These \nsmart agricultural machines should be:\
    \ (a) fast, \naccurate, versatile and intelligent; (b) produce less CO2 \nemissions\
    \ and (c) make use of bioenergy. \n Fields: This refers to an area of land used\
    \ for \nagricultural purposes, i.e. crops, cultivation or for \nlivestock. Many\
    \ fields have borders composed of a strip \nof bushes used to provide both food\
    \ and cover, in order \nto ensure the survival of wildlife. Monitoring field \n\
    activities using IoT devices can have a significantly \npositive impact on controlling\
    \ objects within the field. \nB. Proposed IOT/AI SSA Platform as a Solution \n\
    This platform would prove a valuable medium to facilitate \ndata flow and sharing\
    \ among SSA domains. Many researchers \nhave developed IoT architectures, but\
    \ their efforts have tended \nto target specific areas of IoT/AI, i.e. sensors\
    \ or weather \nmonitoring systems [58, 60, 61]. This current paper is \nproposing\
    \ a holistic IoT/AI platform to cover all areas within a \nSSA environment, performing\
    \ the following tasks: (a) manage \nand govern data flow between SSA domains;\
    \ (b) facilitate the \nintegration of the different components of SSA architecture;\
    \ \n(c) tackle interoperability issues caused by the utilization of \ndifferent\
    \ tools and software; (d) provide easy-to-use interfaces \nfor interaction; (e)\
    \ provide an ability to generate reports based \non real-time data and keep it\
    \ updated; (f) store generated data \nin sustainable storage place (i.e. the Cloud),\
    \ to enable it to \npermanently recorded for future reuse; (g) isolate different\
    \ \nlayers to improve the development process in the future; and \n(h) the platform\
    \ should consist of several nodes, so that, in the \ncase of any failure, other\
    \ nodes can keep the system up and \nrunning. Fig. 3 shows how the SSA-IoT/AI\
    \ platform would be \nused at the center of the SSA domain to facilitate business\
    \ \nprocess and data flow and to share within a smart, sustainable \nagricultural\
    \ environment. \n \nFig. 3. Proposed SSA-IoT/AI Platform. \nC. Proposed IoT/AI\
    \ Technical Architecture for SSA Platform \nFig. 4 shows the overall AI/IoT technical\
    \ architecture for \nSSA. It consists of two main components: (a) the first \n\
    component: SSA Layers and AI/IoT technologies; and (b) the \nsecond component:\
    \ data lifecycle within SSA architecture and \ndata process location. In order\
    \ to provide additional detail \nconcerning the framework, the following description\
    \ gives \nfurther details about each component: \n1) The First component: Smart\
    \ Sustainable Agriculture \n(SSA) layers and (SSA) AI/IoT technologies \nThe first\
    \ component of smart, sustainable agriculture \n(SSA), AI/IOT framework, consists\
    \ of the following layers: \n(a) Physical Hardware and Storage layer; (b) AI and\
    \ Data \nManagement layer, and Governance layer; (c) Network layer; \n(d) Security\
    \ layer; (e) Application layer; (f) IoT and sensing \nlayer; and (g) SSA domain\
    \ layer. Fig. 4 demonstrates the \nfollowing description of each layer, highlighting\
    \ its primary \nrole: \n Physical hardware and Storage layer: This layer \nconsists\
    \ of powerful hardware to host virtualized \nmachines, as well as dedicated traditional\
    \ storage \nmedium, cloud storage solutions or hybrid storage \nsolutions. It\
    \ contains the supporting hardware for IoT \ndevices that exist in Internet of\
    \ Thins and Sensing layer. \n Artificial Intelligence and Data Management Layer:\
    \ \nThis layer is responsible for managing processes and \ncontrolling the business\
    \ logic, focussing on three main \nactivities: (i) data analysis and processing,\
    \ using data \nmining and intelligence statistical analysis on generated \ndata;\
    \ (ii) data classification and transformation, using \nontologies, and machine\
    \ learning to classify and \ntransform analysed data; and (iii) data interpretation,\
    \ \nrepresenting the transformed data into knowledge to \nmake machines smarter.\
    \ \n Network Layer: This layer contains all the different \ntypes of network\
    \ connections exist, with this cloud \nconsisting \nof \nwired \nor \nwireless\
    \ \nnetwork \nconnections/devices. It is important that this layer uses \nthe\
    \ latest networking technologies to keep up with the \nmost recent developments\
    \ in other sectors. Its main job \nis to facilitate the transaction of all data\
    \ to and from \ndifferent \nlayers \nwithin \nthe \narchitecture. \nThe \ntechnologies\
    \ of IoT in this layer include Internet, WIFI \nand GSM/CMDA. It is responsible\
    \ for data accessibility \nand availability throughout other layers. Further,\
    \ it \nmanages data and its flow within between all layers. \n Security Layer:\
    \ This layer is responsible for data \nsecurity transferred among different layers\
    \ and should \nbe the means of addressing any security concerns and \nvulnerabilities\
    \ within all other IoT/SSA layers, i.e. \nmalware, spyware and viruses. It should\
    \ employ up-to-\ndate security solutions and AI algorithms to block and \nquarantine\
    \ any threat to the platform. \n Applications Layers: This layer gathers different\
    \ \napplications related to smart sustainable agriculture. It \nis built based\
    \ on AI and data management layers. Many \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n100 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nsmart, sustainable agricultural applications could be\
    \ \ndeveloped and integrated into this layer, i.e. crop \nmonitoring \napplications\
    \ \nand \ndrone-controlled \napplications. This layer focuses on the supervision\
    \ \naspect of the data flow and migration between all layers \nand can provide\
    \ an authorized institution with full or \npartial governance on data migration,\
    \ transactions and \naccess. \n Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensing Layer: This\
    \ \nforms the first interaction layer with SSA domains. It \nuses and hosts various\
    \ types of IoT devices (e.g. \nsensors), capable of collecting data from real-world\
    \ \nobjects, sharing it to provide real-time data. Many \nsensors in the Cloud\
    \ are hosted and integrated within \nthis layer, i.e. humidity sensors, moisture\
    \ sensors and \nweather monitoring systems. Furthermore, this layer is \nresponsible\
    \ for operating robotic and drone actuators to \nassist in the mobility of intelligent\
    \ machines within the \nagricultural area. It thus allows intelligent machines\
    \ to \nmove between locations, in order to cover a wide area. \n SSA Domain Layer:\
    \ This layer hosts various different \nSmart Sustainable Architectural domains\
    \ and forms the \nmain source for data generated from various \nagricultural domains,\
    \ including: fields; machines; \nhuman resources; and crops. It forms the basis\
    \ for \nIOT/AI SSA platforms, as it contains various raw data \nformats without\
    \ interference. \n2) The Second component: data lifecycle within SSA \nArchitecture\
    \ and its process location: \nFig. 5 demonstrates that data lifecycle remains\
    \ in line with \nSSA Architecture layers. This commences with the original \n\
    data source, i.e. SSA domain layers. The acquisition and \ncapturing of data is\
    \ undertaken at the layer containing sensors \nand actuators. These captured data\
    \ are then passed to the \napplication layer for business logic and control, following\
    \ \nwhich, the data must be checked for security issues before \nmoving to data\
    \ analysis and processing. This is followed by \ndata classification and transformation\
    \ of the analyzed and \nprocessed data before it moves to data interpretation\
    \ and the \nresulting building decisions. The final stage is to store the data\
    \ \nfor future retrieval. \nThere are two locations for sharing and processing\
    \ of \ngenerated data. Firstly, on-site. Here, the generated data is \nmore likely\
    \ to be shared and processed within the location of \nthe agricultural field,\
    \ covering the four architecture layers: \n(1) SSA; (2) the domain layer; (3)\
    \ the IoT layer; and (4) the \napplication layer. Secondly, off-site: here the\
    \ sharing and \nprocessing of the generated data must be outsourced to the \n\
    physical location „data centre‟, in which data is processed and \nanalyzed away\
    \ from the field. It can cover the four architecture \nlayers: (1) network; (2)\
    \ AI and data management; (3) physical; \nand (4) storage. It is also important\
    \ to highlight that the \nSecurity layer forms a common layer between on-site\
    \ and off-\nsite processing locations. \n \nFig. 4. Overall AI/IoT Platform Technical\
    \ Architecture for SSA. \n \nFig. 5. IoT/AI Data Lifecycle. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis paper has established\
    \ the importance of employing \nrecent and advanced computing technologies in\
    \ the agricultural \nsector, in particularly AI and IoT. Agriculture is considered\
    \ \ncentral to the survival of human beings. Supporting the current \npractices\
    \ of traditional agriculture with recent IoT/AI \ntechnologies can improve the\
    \ performance, quality and volume \nof production. This study has reviewed the\
    \ existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies discussed within the main research journals in\
    \ the \narea of agricultural. Furthermore, it categorized the main \ndomains of\
    \ smart, sustainable agriculture, i.e. human resources; \ncrops; weather; soil;\
    \ pests; fertilization; farming products; \nirrigation/water; livestock; machines;\
    \ and fields. The major \ncontribution of this paper concerns the AI/IoT technical\
    \ \narchitecture for SSA, leading to an emphasis on the research \nand development\
    \ of a unified AI/IoT platform for SSA, to \npositively resolve issues resulting\
    \ from the fragmentary nature \nof the agricultural process. Future work will\
    \ include \ninvestigation of the process of implementing AI/IoT \ntechnologies\
    \ for SSA by applying the proposed AI/IoT \ntechnical architecture in the form\
    \ of the prototype of a unified \nplatform on real test cases. This will identify\
    \ the relevant \nstrengthens and weaknesses for further improvement and \nenhancement.\

  analysis: 'The authors propose a system for smart irrigation of tomatoes that leverages
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices and modules for data collection, transmission,
    and automated action. The system uses soil moisture sensors to monitor the water
    content in the soil, and an automated drip irrigation system to deliver water
    to the plants as needed. A mobile application is also provided for farmers to
    monitor the system and control the irrigation process remotely.


    The paper presents the results of a large-scale field experiment conducted to
    evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results demonstrate that
    the system significantly improves tomato yield compared to traditional irrigation
    methods, and also reduces water consumption. The authors attribute these improvements
    to the system''s ability to accurately monitor soil moisture and deliver water
    precisely to the plants.


    The proposed system represents a significant advancement in the field of smart
    irrigation, and has the potential to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability.
    The system''s use of IoT devices and modules enables real-time monitoring and
    control of the irrigation process, which is essential for optimizing water use
    and maximizing crop yields. The system''s scalability and cost-effectiveness make
    it a viable solution for farmers of all sizes, and its ease of use makes it accessible
    to even those with limited technical expertise.


    In summary, the proposed system provides a comprehensive and effective solution
    for smart irrigation of tomatoes. The system''s use of IoT devices and modules,
    combined with its ability to accurately monitor soil moisture and deliver water
    precisely to the plants, enables significant improvements in tomato yield and
    water consumption. The system''s scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of
    use make it a viable and accessible solution for farmers of all sizes.'

    DOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, no other invention\
    \ has generated as much\nexcitement in the computing world as the Internet. Because\
    \ of its\ntremendous strength and breadth of uses, it is virtually ubiquitous\n\
    in every sector of human endeavor (Kumar et al., 2017; Poyen et al.,\n2020; Terence\
    \ and Purushothaman, 2020). People and\norganizations have connected with amazing\
    \ agility and\nconvenience in recent years, thanks to a vast 5G network of\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs), healthcare services, cellphones,\nand various sorts\
    \ of pervasive real-time monitoring systems\n(Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju, 2019;\
    \ Hassan et al., 2021). The\nhuman population is expanding at an alarming rate,\
    \ but at the same\ntime, pollution is slowly depleting the earth’s water and land\n\
    supplies. Smart agriculture is seen as playing a crucial role in\nresponding to\
    \ these issues. Smart agriculture has the potential to\nvastly enhance both the\
    \ agroecological setting and the yield and\nquality of agricultural products while\
    \ simultaneously decreasing the\nneed for harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ (Zhang et al.,\n2022). The use of ICTs to automate and intelligently manage\n\
    agricultural cultivation and production is central to the concept\nof “smart agriculture.”\
    \ In particular, wireless communications play\na signiﬁcant role in the growth\
    \ of agriculture, and each new\ngeneration of wireless communication technology\
    \ propels farming\ntoward a higher level of intelligence.\nPeople and objects\
    \ may connect in real-time thanks to the 5G\nnetwork-based Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), which provides important\nservices and value to millions of people across\
    \ the world (Guevara\net al., 2020; Biswal et al., 2021). 5G network-based IoT\
    \ has\ndeveloped organically into a gigantic technology platform. South\nAmerica\
    \ has initiated a yearly warm-season tomato yield that\nbelongs to the Solanaceae\
    \ family (Van Eck et al., 2019; Kumar\net al., 2022).\nDespite requiring high\
    \ amounts of fertilizer, tomato is a\npopular or demanding plant due to its health\
    \ signiﬁcance to the\nwhole world, with high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoid,\n\
    lycopene, and vitamins C and A and phenolic compounds, which\nprovide a wide range\
    \ of health advantages for the consumers\n(Campestrini et al., 2019; Samanta et\
    \ al., 2020; Chen P. et al.,\n2021). Tshiala and Olwoch reported that tomatoes\
    \ have been used\nin food preparation throughout the world as fresh vegetables\
    \ or as\nspices. It has a vital role in the Ethiopian marketing of vegetables\n\
    (Guodaar et al., 2020; Biswas et al., 2021). The production of\ntomatoes was used\
    \ as a job opportunity and as an income source\nfor producers.\nNutrient and water\
    \ supplies have a signiﬁcant impact on tomato\nquality, and their highest water\
    \ demand is quoted in an unpublished\npaper. Some poisonous elements and inorganic\
    \ substances that are\ndangerous to people can demonstrate water quality (Sanjuan-Delm´\n\
    as et al., 2020; Chen P. et al., 2021). This may be a problem for\nirrigation\
    \ using municipal wastewater. Although municipal\nwastewaters have been applied\
    \ as much as possible to irrigation,\nthey contain comparatively maximum sodium\
    \ quantities that can\nbe accumulated with this wastewater and have toxic effects\
    \ on plant\nsoils during optimized irrigation (Jayalakshmi and Gomathi, 2019;\n\
    Leuther et al., 2019; Casadei et al., 2021). The various types of crop\ngrowth\
    \ models are extremely useful in optimizing irrigation\npractices which are based\
    \ on physical or semi-empirical equations\nfor simpliﬁcation of the complex mechanism\
    \ and also having many\nparameters in the process (Sanjuan-Delm´as et al., 2020).\
    \ Because\nof its balance of simplicity, accuracy, and robustness, the AquaCrop\n\
    model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\nhas provided a\
    \ method for calculating crop yields and optimal\nirrigation scheduling for various\
    \ crops in different climates. In the\ncurrent real-time model, parameters like\
    \ soil moisture (SM), crop\ncultivation, leaf area index (LAI), or canopy cover\
    \ (CC) are\ncollected using various remote sensing devices. As a result, this\n\
    real-time cultivation process is an upgraded and fully dynamic\nversion of the\
    \ traditional models (Leuther et al., 2019; Chen P.\net al., 2021).\nA fast and\
    \ dependable Internet connection is necessary for\nagricultural IoT devices to\
    \ function. The current generation of\nmobile networks is failing due to insufﬁcient\
    \ connectivity in rural\nareas, and even in areas with high-speed access, failure\
    \ occurs due to\nmassive demand. According to a recent survey, nearly 80% of rural\n\
    areas, even in the United Kingdom, are outside of the 4G range. The\ncurrent degree\
    \ of network access in rural areas is insufﬁcient in most\nnations (Tang et al.,\
    \ 2021). In addition, in some developed\ncountries, there are multiple farms with\
    \ a large number of IoT\ndevices and machines that require a constant reliable\
    \ high-speed\nInternet connection to exchange a large amount of data, and the\n\
    technologies of the current generation of mobile networks cannot\ncope with these\
    \ demands (Singh et al., 2022). To fulﬁll these goals,\nmany promising technologies,\
    \ such as massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO), network slicing, and\
    \ smaller cells, are\nneeded to provide reliable connectivity over a larger distance.\n\
    Therefore, the smart mobile network is well suited to support\nsmart farming by\
    \ enabling wide coverage, low-energy\nconsumption, low-cost devices, and high\
    \ spectrum efﬁciency.\nUnfortunately, the IoT-based network’s usage of microwaves\n\
    (MWs) as carriers limits its ability to cover wide areas. The\nintroduction of\
    \ small base stations spaced at roughly 250 m\nintervals over coverage regions\
    \ that can be extended to any size\nallows for continuous connectivity, thanks\
    \ to the small cell\nconcept. In order to link the bigger areas, the related small\n\
    towers can be placed everywhere (on lamp posts, in trees, on\nroofs, on tops of\
    \ vehicles, etc.). Similar to 4G, this implementation\nmakes use of the massive\
    \ MIMO approach by equipping nodes\nwith many antennas for sending and receiving\
    \ data in order to\nincrease the network’s capacity. On the other hand, huge MIMO\n\
    makes signal interference more likely. Beamforming is used to\nincrease the throughput\
    \ of transmitted data and thereby solve this\nissue. Beamforming refers to an\
    \ antenna’s capability of directing\nfocused beams of radio waves at speciﬁc targets.\
    \ An advanced\nInternet connection provides very high (MW) operating\nfrequencies,\
    \ and the accompanying high bandwidth makes it\npossible for larger and more rapid\

    \ the cognitive radio\napproach used by the smart network allows for device-speciﬁc\n\

    \ Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nIn 2017, for the ﬁrst time, the 5G RuralFirst\
    \ project successfully\nplanted and harvested a crop using autonomous tractors\
    \ to sow\nseeds, drones to monitor crops, and machines to apply water,\nfertilizer,\
    \ and pesticides. The entire procedure was carried out\nwithout the need for any\
    \ laborers. Another initiative, Hands Free\nHectare, claimed a successful harvest\
    \ in 2018 (Al-Ghobari and\nMohammad, 2011). With greater technological breakthroughs,\
    \ 5G\nis projected to promote precision farming. As IoT-based network\ncoverage\
    \ grows, agricultural sector producers will beneﬁt greatly,\nallowing them to\
    \ manage farms, animals, and other assets from the\ncomfort of their own homes,\
    \ thanks to their big capacity, fast data\nspeed, and low latency. Smart technology\
    \ will help to advance IoT\nsensor connectivity to the next level, paving the\
    \ way for\nunprecedented innovation in smart farming components.\nImplementing\
    \ technology to automate, track, and monitor\nagricultural processes is a wise\
    \ solution to the irrigation problem.\nThe traditional irrigation method is fully\
    \ automated by using IoT\nintegration modules. However, with an advanced network\
    \ on the\nhorizon, smart agriculture will take off with lightning-fast\ndata transfer.\n\
    To improve farm produce quality, smart farming combines\ntraditional agronomic\
    \ practices with the IoT. The application of\nnew technology in agriculture can\
    \ assist farmers in reducing labor\nand costs while increasing crop yield and\
    \ production. To facilitate\nall of these agricultural beneﬁts, the IoT includes\
    \ a wide range of\ncomponents under digital and automated technologies. So, IoT-\n\
    based connectivity will vastly increase the impact due to low latency,\nhigh bandwidth,\
    \ and support for many sensors communicating at\nthe same time.\nThe IoT technology\
    \ platform already helps to increase\nproductivity and ensure proper resource\
    \ utilization through\nprecision agriculture. The implementation of IoT, on the\
    \ other\nhand, will help to accelerate the entire process with machine-to-\nmachine\
    \ services. The real-time data transfer capabilities of the IoT\nmodule can aid\
    \ in the rapid operation of these solutions, making\ndecision-making quick, robust,\
    \ data-oriented, and real-time. With\nan IoT-based network, these devices can\
    \ send real-time data about\nthe need for optimal irrigation, spoilt crops, and\
    \ their location to\nfollow-up machinery. Farmers can save time and money by\n\
    harvesting crops quickly and effectively with automated irrigation\nfor tomato\
    \ crop cultivation.\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n•\n\
    An efﬁcient IoT-based framework is proposed for tomato\ncultivation.\n•\nMoisture\
    \ levels in the soil are predicted with the help of IoT\nmodules to optimize the\
    \ irrigation system.\n•\nA mobile application is also developed that can help\
    \ farmers\nby providing useful information.\nThe remaining parts of the paper\
    \ are arranged as follows. Section\n2 discusses the literature review. Section\
    \ 3 explains the things used\nfor designing smart farming solutions. Section 4\
    \ details the proposed\nsystem and the methodology. The simulation setup and results\n\
    analyses are described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2 Literature\
    \ review\nChen et al. (2019) discussed the proper utilization of water for\nthe\
    \ growth of tomatoes by using the fuzzy neural network with a\ngenetic algorithm\
    \ (GA). It predicted the volume of irrigation based\non the effect of greenhouse\
    \ and the growth of crops (Guha et al.,\n2021). Rodrı́guez et al (Rodr´ıguez-Ortega\
    \ et al., 2019). developed a\nsoilless technique to yield tomato crops through\
    \ the treatment of\nsalinity. Here, the salinity treatment was speciﬁcally used\
    \ to\nimprove the production of vegetables and nutritional imbalance\n(psychological\
    \ of plants) for crops. Zhai et al. (2015) proposed an\nidea for the cultivation\
    \ of tomatoes using saline water and the\nblossom-end rot technique. Implementing\
    \ these two yield methods\nenhanced the level of production.\nIn the study of\
    \ Shao et al. (2014), two levels of irrigation\ntechniques were designed for heavy\
    \ rain shelters and drainage\ntreatments for improving the productivity of crops.\
    \ An optimum\nirrigation management technique was designed for yielding quality\n\
    tomatoes through the proper arrangement of rain shelters (Keswani\net al., 2020;\
    \ Maroli et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2021). In the study of\nGil et al. (2019),\
    \ the smart grid system monitored the precision for\nirrigation of water on demand\
    \ using IoT. The authors added\ndesalination and solar energy processes in the\
    \ agricultural system\nfor efﬁcient cultivation.\nKrishna et al. (2017) designed\
    \ a smart farming method for\nintelligent water-saving irrigation using the Raspberry\
    \ Pi module\nand sensors. So, it automated the yielding of crops in a higher range\n\
    that regulates through IoT modules. Qiu et al. (2020) implemented\nan in-depth\
    \ process to collect phenotypic parameters for measuring\nthe growth of tomatoes.\
    \ This system precisely calculated the\ndeﬁciency of water level and fertilizer\
    \ with the help of a neural\nnetwork algorithm for the growth cycle of tomato\
    \ (Khamparia et al.,\n2020; Biswal et al., 2021). An intelligent irrigation system\
    \ was\ndeﬁned as the water requirement for the yielding of tomatoes\nduring a\
    \ various range of climate states by Mason et al. (2019). In\nthis study, smart\
    \ irrigation was used in an adverse situation through\nproper integration of the\
    \ IoT module, sensors, and connectionless\nenvironments (Chen M. et al., 2021).\n\
    In the agriculture industry, 4G/3G/NB-IoT wireless network\ntechnology is used\
    \ to connect IoT-based smart devices for the\npurposes of data sharing, precise\
    \ assessment, accurate calculation,\netc (Dell’Uomo and Scarrone, 2002). Although\
    \ the 3G/4G\nnetworking paradigm has shown much promise, there are still\nseveral\
    \ obstacles that may prevent it from being used to its full\npotential in the\
    \ agriculture sector. One of the main restraints is the\navailable working space.\
    \ Existing wireless networks do not reach out\nto rural areas or dense urban neighborhoods.\
    \ Channel\ncircumstances, resource allocation, ﬂuctuating data rates, and\nhandoff\
    \ problems between diverse networks all make it difﬁcult to\nfacilitate quality\
    \ of service (QoS) in 4G networks (Payaswini and\nManjaiah, 2014; Payero et al.,\
    \ 2017). Mobile devices in this network\nhave a short lifespan due to the utilization\
    \ of many antennas and\ntransmitters. Many modern agricultural sectors rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered technologies like drones and robots, but these have limited\n\
    usefulness in far-ﬂung crop ﬁelds. The number of IoT devices used\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n03\nin\
    \ smart farming, as well as the amount of research done on these\ndevices, is\
    \ growing rapidly, necessitating greater intelligence, speed,\nscalability, secure\
    \ communication capabilities, and processing\npower to handle the numerous complex\
    \ computational tasks and\nheavily utilized services. Having ultralow latency\
    \ in addition to high\nconnection is necessary for IoT devices to achieve quick\n\
    performance and low costs.\nThe current 4G networks (LTE) are limited in their\
    \ ability to\nenable such functionalities because they only permit connectivity\n\
    through IP-based packet switching (Zhaogan et al., 2007). The shift\nto 5G cellular\
    \ networks will eliminate these problems caused by\nprevious generations of wireless\
    \ technology. Due to advancements\nin 5G connectivity, farmers now have the option\
    \ of remotely\npiloting a drone over extensive distances, either manually or via\n\
    predetermined checkpoints (Faraci et al., 2018; Sinha and\nDhanalakshmi, 2022).\
    \ A farmer can get high-deﬁnition video\nstreams and other critical sensory data\
    \ and telemetry from drones\nin real time over the 5G cellular network, which\
    \ is more efﬁcient\nand reliable than previous-generation mobile networks\n(Bhattacharya\
    \ and De, 2021). Due to 5G technology, drones will\nnot need to carry a lot of\
    \ computing power and instead can upload\ntheir data to the cloud, where it will\
    \ be processed more quickly.\nTo demonstrate the importance of smart agriculture,\n\
    Thilakarathne et al. (2023) show a cloud-enabled, low-cost\nsensorized Internet\
    \ of Things platform for monitoring and\nautomating processes related to a tomato\
    \ plantation in a\ncontrolled indoor setting. We hope that the information gleaned\n\
    from this study will be used as a foundation for advancing smart\nagriculture\
    \ solutions that boost productivity and quality and pave\nthe way for a more sustainable\
    \ future.\nUsman et al. (2022) present a 6G use case for plant health\nmonitoring\
    \ using a terahertz (THz)-signal-based integrated\nsensor and communication system.\
    \ Precision agriculture is best\nunderstood as a smart management system with\
    \ the capacity to\ntrack and regulate plant health and water levels on both a\n\
    microscopic and a macro scale. The objective is to maximize\noutput while minimizing\
    \ waste of scarce resources. THz-based\nsensing technology, which can evaluate\
    \ plant health on a cellular\nlevel, combined with wireless sensor networks installed\
    \ within\ncrops to monitor multiple variables while making intelligent\ndecisions,\
    \ could have signiﬁcant implications for agriculture. A\nsustainable communication\
    \ infrastructure that takes into account\nthe needs of dispersed and adaptable\
    \ agricultural settings is\nnecessary for the integration and operation of such\
    \ a macro–\nnano-sensor system.\n3 Materials and methods\nThe growth and productivity\
    \ of plants depend mainly on how\nmuch water is formed during the seedling phase.\
    \ During this time,\nwater demand has an important effect on crops, which have\
    \ many\nenvironmental aspects like temperature, quality of soil, etc. The\napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture is limitless, which provides various\nintelligent devices\
    \ to improve yielding performance and proﬁt\n(Gomathy et al., 2020; Sivakumar\
    \ et al., 2020). However, there are\nvarious issues with investing in smart cultivation\
    \ and also difﬁculty\nin the development of agriculture-related IoT apps (Kamienski\n\
    et al., 2019; Conesa et al., 2021).\na) Hardware unit:\nThe information will inﬂuence\
    \ the development of IoT\nsolutions for farming, and there is a need to select\
    \ sensors to\ncreate the custom device that will collect data for the proposed\n\
    solution (Althar and Samanta, 2021; Guha and Samanta, 2021;\nZhang et al., 2021).\
    \ However, the quality of the sensors has a crucial\npart in production which\
    \ depends on the exactness of the collected\ndata and its consistency.\nb) Brain\
    \ unit:\nSmart agriculture should be used as data analytics for a design\nsolution\
    \ that will be helpful if yeomen cannot make sense of it, so\nthere is a need\
    \ to use powerful data analytics techniques and relate\npredictive algorithms\
    \ and machine learning methods for\ncollecting data.\nc) Maintenance unit:\nHardware\
    \ maintenance is a signiﬁcant challenge for IoT-based\nagriculture, while the\
    \ sensors are commonly used in the crop ﬁeld.\nThere are more chances for damaged\
    \ sensors, which needs to be\naddressed by making a smart device that is robust\
    \ and easy to\nsustain. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced with another sensor.\n\
    d) Mobility stage:\nSmart farming applications can be remotely monitored through\n\
    a smartphone or desktop computer for transmitting related yielding\ninformation\
    \ to the owner (Maheswari et al., 2021; Mekala et al.,\n2021). The integration\
    \ of devices should be autonomous and also\ncover enough wireless range to communicate\
    \ and send data to the\ncentral server.\ne) Infrastructure unit:\nA solid and\
    \ robust internal infrastructure needs to ensure that\nthe intelligent cropping\
    \ process performs well and securely handles\nthe data load in it.\nIf the process\
    \ disables the security, someone easily breaks the\nentire system and steals related\
    \ data or controls intelligent devices.\n3.1 Agricultural/crop production system\n\
    The cultivation model can be used to monitor or calculate the\namount of native\
    \ agricultural products, depending upon the\ncultivated area and supported by\
    \ the decision support system\n(Nagarajan and Minu, 2018). Figure 1 shows the\
    \ agricultural/crop\nproduction prediction factors.\nThe number of exports and\
    \ imports of agricultural products can\nbe derived from the prediction model of\
    \ the National Statistical\nOfﬁce’s (NSO) statistics database as depicted in this\
    \ section. The\nagricultural product crop and yielded area models are worked under\n\
    the production of the smart agricultural prediction model, which\nevaluates the\
    \ updated method as well as the predecessor observation\nmethod to reinterpret\
    \ it.\nlnAx,t = a0 + a1lnRPx,t−1 + a2lnRPy,t + a3lnAx,t−1\n(1)\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n04\nwhere\
    \ Ax,t is seeding in x yield design at t year, Ax,t−1 is seeding\nin x yield design\
    \ at t−1 year, RPx,t−1 is the marketplace value in x\nyield design at t−1 year,\
    \ and RPy,t is the market place value in y yield\ndesign at t year.\nY Dx,t =\
    \ b0 + b1WT1\nx,t + b2WT2\nx,t\n(2)\nwhere Y Dx,t is the crop in x yield design\
    \ at t year, WTx,t\n1 is the\nweather (temperature) in x yield design at t year,\
    \ and WTx,t\n2 is the\nclimate (amount of rainfall) in x yield design at t year.\n\
    The quantity of domestic products is the summation of\nagricultural products of\
    \ all individual yield areas and each\nfunctional value of it (Gurunath et al.,\
    \ 2018; Mohanty et al., 2019;\nBenyezza et al., 2021). The agricultural product\
    \ amount is the\nmultiplication of the ﬁeld with the crop model.\nThe demand method\
    \ of the crop is the multiplication of the\ndemand method per method in addition\
    \ to the demands of the\nwhole community. The resource purposes of agricultural\
    \ products\ndepend on export and import scenarios and other supporting\nfactors,\
    \ as depicted in Figure 1. The above equations must follow\n“Nerlove’s partial\
    \ adjustment model,” and the regional weather\ninformation can help concede the\
    \ prediction although there are\nsome missing values (El-Zawily et al., 2019).\n\
    3.2 Challenges in the purpose system\nDespite the many advantages that the 3G/4G\
    \ networking\nparadigm offers, there are still several obstacles that prevent\
    \ it\nfrom being used to its full potential in the agriculture industry.\nSpace\
    \ constraints pose serious problems. Current wireless networks\nare unable to\
    \ reach more remote places or crowded metropolitan\nneighborhoods. Supporting\
    \ the quality of service (QoS) in 4G\nnetworks is difﬁcult due to channel conditions,\
    \ resource\nallocation, varying data rates, and handoff problems between\nheterogeneous\
    \ networks. Due to the heavy use of antennae and\ntransmitters in this network,\
    \ the lifespan of mobile devices is short.\nIn order for Internet of Things devices\
    \ to deliver quick performance\nat low prices, ultralow latency must be paired\
    \ with a strong\nconnection. Due to the limitations of IP-based packet switching\n\
    connectivity on the existing 4G network (LTE), such features are\nnow unavailable.\
    \ These issues, which have plagued earlier\ngenerations of cellular networks,\
    \ will be eradicated with the\ntransition to IoT-based networks.\nDue to its massive\
    \ data capacity and speeds greater than 10 Gbps,\nIoT-based connection will be\
    \ able to link billions of devices. For both\ndownload and upload speeds, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to be up to 100\ntimes faster than their 4G and 4G LTE predecessors.\
    \ 5G can connect\nbillions of devices due to its increased bandwidth, in addition\
    \ to its large\ndata capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. The download and\
    \ upload\nspeeds of IoT-based networks will be up to 100 times faster than those\
    \ of\n4G and 4G LTE networks. Consequently, a 2-h movie that would take 6\nmin\
    \ to download on 4G would take less than 4 s to download on an\nadvanced network.\
    \ Technical speciﬁcations for 5G are being developed\nby the International Telecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU). The uplink peak\ndata rate is 10 Gbps, and the downlink peak data\
    \ rate is 20 Gbps per\nmobile station. Therefore, an IoT-enabled network is used\
    \ for the\nInternet of Things-based smart irrigation system, which allows for\n\
    remote monitoring of soil moisture and watering.\n3.3 Mobile application\nA mobile\
    \ application is accessed by farmers on farms. Using this\napplication, we can\
    \ make predictions utilizing insight data and the\ncollected cultivation insights\
    \ data (Dhanush et al., 2017; Hota et al.,\n2020; Maheswari et al., 2021). The\
    \ mobile application will provide\ncrop-relevant information like crop health\
    \ alerts, pest control, and\nwarehouse inventory managing warnings as shown below.\
    \ The key\nfeatures of mobile applications are as follows:\n•\nobserving yield\
    \ health facts (nutrient levels, pH levels, etc.)\nthrough the functionality of\
    \ yield inspection (Ahmadi et al.,\n2019),\n•\nthe application of organizing fertilizer\
    \ and insecticides for\nthe farm (Kiryushin, 2019),\n•\nautomating the irrigation\
    \ system and controlling water\nlevels as well as soil health over the farm (Al-Ali\
    \ et al.,\n2019; Li et al., 2020), and\n•\ntracing yield records and checking\
    \ warehouse details (bin\ninventories) (Quitaleg and Ortiz, 2020).\nFIGURE 1\n\

    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\n3.4 Impact of water quality on\
    \ tomato yield\nTomato yield is a broad view that encompasses the interactions\n\
    of various single-quality attributes. Irrigation water salinity\nenhanced tomato\
    \ amounts, fruit thickness, soluble solids, total\nacid, vitamin C, and the sugar–acid\
    \ ratio (Magán et al., 2008).\nFresh tomato yield, canopy diameter, fruit water\
    \ content,\ntomato ﬁrmness, and calcium and nitrogen concentrations\ndecreased\
    \ as water salinity levels increased, whereas increasing\nsalinity levels increased\
    \ texture strength (Shao et al., 2014). In\naddition, saline water irrigation\
    \ increased tomato fruit’s total\nsoluble solids and acidity (pH) by 11.1% and\
    \ 6.9%, respectively.\n3.5 Role of the contactless IR sensors for\ntomato crop\
    \ growth measurement\nThe contactless IR sensors are used to produce infrared\n\
    radiation to measure the plant’s growth from its stem, whereas\nthe radiation\
    \ is converted into some amount of electricity and is less\nthan 10 cm from the\
    \ target. In the proposed system, sensors are\nplaced more than 10 cm from the\
    \ plant, which will measure growth\nby using a method based on the speculation\
    \ of infrared energy. The\nIR sensors are ﬁtted with infrared ﬁlters to avoid\
    \ outside disturbing\nlight. IR sensors are ﬁtted to measure the thickness growth\
    \ of\ntomato crops through the analog output voltage. The energy\nradiations of\
    \ infrared sensors are transformed into distance data,\nwhich is not directly\
    \ propositional to distance data.\n4 Proposed system and methods\nThe evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) crop is described as the amount of\nwater necessary for the perfect growth\
    \ of various crops in\nconnection with the lack of water by evapotranspiration\
    \ which is\ndiscussed in this system. The demand for yielding waters refers to\n\
    an optimally developed harvest, so that a consistent, disease-free\ncrop is actively\
    \ cultivated and completely sheltered. An advanced\nnetwork can connect billions\
    \ of devices due to its increased\nbandwidth, in addition to its large data capacity\
    \ and speeds faster\nthan 10 Gbps. The download and upload speeds of smart networks\n\
    will be up to 100 times faster than those of 4G and 4G LTE\nnetworks. So, this\
    \ method is advantageous in addition to IoT\nmodules, which gives a perfect way\
    \ to produce tomatoes in the\nseasonal and non-seasonal periods. The cultivation\
    \ process is\nmainly inﬂuenced by the following situations like weather, yield\n\
    type, and development stage of the harvest, which is depicted in\nFigures 2, 3.\n\
    The proposed system is integrated with the following\ncomponents which are described\
    \ below:\ni. Arduino Uno microcontroller:\nIt is an open-source microcontroller\
    \ that can be programmed\nby writing C or C++ code to control the overall system\
    \ automation.\nAfter installing and programming the Arduino, it is ready to collect\n\
    the number of inputs from IR moisture soil sensors and also provide\na remote\
    \ command to control the irrigation system. However, this\nmicrocontroller remotely\
    \ controls the overall execution process.\nii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:\nSoil\
    \ moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil\nproperty that plays\
    \ a vital role in a variety of farming activities,\nhydrological processes, and\
    \ environmental concerns. A near-\ninfrared (NIR) reﬂectance sensor is created\
    \ for the calculation of\nmoisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting\n\
    diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of\n1,945 nm and\
    \ a strong water absorption band and the other with a\nwavelength of 1,850 nm\
    \ and a weak water absorption band. It is\nlinked to an Arduino controller to\
    \ record the moisture level of the\nsoil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to\
    \ the water controller for\nirrigation in the tomato cultivation land.\niii. Pinolex\
    \ drip automatic water controller:\nThe smart ﬂower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to manage\nand control tomato crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation\n\
    or anywhere, an automatic water timer is set by the Arduino\nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which is useful for watering tomato cultivation.\nIt ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm)\
    \ thread tap. It can water the plants\nregularly, even when no one is at home,\
    \ and thus improve their\nsurvival rate.\niv. Wi-Fi access point:\nFIGURE 2\n\
    The proposed system for the smart irrigation of tomato yields.\nSingh et al.\n\

    \ high-speed Ethernet wire links a router to an access point,\nwhich transforms\
    \ a connection-oriented signal into a\nconnectionless signal. Connectionless connectivity\
    \ is typically the\nonly available option for base stations, which use Wi-Fi to\
    \ establish\nlinks with destination devices. As a result, the Wi-Fi service is\
    \ linked\nto the 5G Internet, and it then provides a direct link with the end\n\
    user to remotely monitor and control automatic irrigation as well as\ntomato crop\
    \ cultivation.\n4.1 Working principle of the model\nThe purpose model generally\
    \ performs the operation in the\nfollowing steps:\nStep 1:\nFirst of all, the\
    \ NIR contactless sensor observes the moisture\nlevel of the soil. As a result,\
    \ it is connected near the tomato plant to\ncollect soil moisture. A ﬁeld’s soil\
    \ moisture status is critical for\nmaking planting, fertilizer application, and\
    \ irrigation decisions.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, the moisture levels are observed through\
    \ the Arduino\nUno module, which is also linked with a Wi-Fi access point to send\n\
    all the data to the mobile applications with the help of 5G\ntechnology. The 5G\
    \ network helps to gather the moisture levels\nthrough the cloud service and automatically\
    \ regulates the\nirrigation system.\nStep 3:\nWhen the moisture level is monitored\
    \ through the mobile app,\nthen the drip irrigation system is smartly controlled\
    \ through the\n5G-enabled IoT module (Arduino Uno microcontroller).\n4.2 Evaporation\
    \ and\ntranspiration processes\nEvaporation and transpiration happen at the same\
    \ time, and\nthere is no way to talk about them separately. The fraction of solar\n\
    radiation that reaches the cropped soil surface is used to calculate\nevaporation.\
    \ However, once the crop has matured to the point that\nit completely covers the\
    \ soil surface, transpiration becomes the ﬁrst\nprocess. IoT module sensors properly\
    \ calculate the moisture level of\nthe soil with the help of the calculation process\
    \ of ET.\nEvapotranspiration is commonly deﬁned in mm/time, and\nwater quantity\
    \ lost from a cropped plane is deﬁned in water\ndepth units. Because 2 hectares\
    \ has an area of 20,000 m2 and 2\nmm equals 0.002 m, a loss of 2 mm of water corresponds\
    \ to a loss of\n10 m3 of water per hectare. Finally, 2 mm day−1 corresponds to\
    \ 10\nm3 ha−1 day−l.\nThe quantity of energy received per unit area can also be\
    \ used to\ncharacterize water depths, with energy referring to the amount of\n\
    heat or energy required to evaporate free water. The latent heat of\nevaporation\
    \ (l) varies with the temperature of water. At 21°C, for\nexample, l is approximately\
    \ 2.50 MJ kg−1. To put it another way,\n2.50 MJ is required to evaporate 2 kg\
    \ or 0.002 m3 of water.\n4.3 Impact of weather on the yielding\nwater requires\
    \ reference crop\nevapotranspiration ETo\nThe main impact of weather information\

    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nThe reference crop evapotranspiration\
    \ deﬁnes the evaporation energy\nof the atmosphere (ETo). Reference crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ also\nknown as reference evapotranspiration, is the evapotranspiration\nrate\
    \ from a reference surface that is not deﬁcient in water and is\nexpressed as\
    \ ETo.\nETo values measured in distinct locations or climates are\nequivalent\
    \ because they indicate identical reference surfaces.\nThese variables inﬂuencing\
    \ ETo can be parameters for climate,\nwhich can be measured using climate information.\
    \ ETo intimates at\na given location, the evaporating energy of the atmosphere.\n\
    In this research domain, different techniques are available for\ncalculating ETo.\
    \ It is tested either by an evapotranspiration pan or\ntheoretically by using\
    \ calculated weather information.\n4.3.1 Saucepan (pan) evaporation technique\n\
    The saucepan evaporation technique allows an environment to\nmonitor the combined\
    \ inﬂuence of temperature, moisture, wind\nspeed, and sunlight on the reference\
    \ yield evapotranspiration ETo.\nThe various evaporation pans are class A evaporation\
    \ pan and\nSunken Colorado pan. The evaporation saucepan is used in the\nfollowing\
    \ equation:\nETo = Kpan \x01 Epan\n(3)\nwhere Kpan is the pan coefﬁcient, Epan\
    \ is the pan evaporation,\nand ETo is the reference yield evapotranspiration.\n\
    4.3.2 Blaney–Criddle technique\nThe Blaney–Criddle method is a theoretical technique\
    \ to\ndetermine the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo, and more\nliterary\
    \ techniques have been used, but many of them were locally\ncalculated. If the\
    \ process is accessed locally, if it is available or if\nlocal procedures are\
    \ not available, then the theoretical method is\nused for the calculation.\nETo\
    \ = P(0:46Tmean + 8)\n(4)\nTmax = omonth(max)\nNdays=month\nTmin = omonth(min)\n\
    Ndays=month\nTmean = Tmax+Tmin\n2\n(5)\nWhere ETo = 1 month of average period,\n\
    Tmean = regular temperature, and\nP = regular proportion of yearly day time periods.\n\
    4.4 Impact of yield type on yield water\nrequires Kc\nThe single crop coefﬁcient\
    \ Kc plays a signiﬁcant role in crop\ncharacteristics as well as the averaged\
    \ effects of soil evaporation.\nAverage crop coefﬁcients are more relevant and\
    \ convenient than Kc\ncomputed on a daily time step using a separate crop and\
    \ soil\ncoefﬁcient for normal irrigation planning and management,\ndevelopment\
    \ of basic irrigation schedules, and most hydrologic\nwater balance studies (Farg\
    \ et al., 2012). The impact of yield type on\nthe yielding water requires dealing\
    \ with the yield type and the\ndevelopment yield stage on water needs. The ﬁeld\
    \ is harvested\nbetween the relationship of reference grown yield and grown yield.\n\
    ETY ield = ETo \x01 Kc\n(6)\nwhere ETYield = yield evapotranspiration process\
    \ (month/day),\nKc = yield inﬂuence, and ETo = reference evapotranspiration. Here,\n\
    ETYield and ETo are stated in equal units in month/day.\n4.4.1 Manipulation of\
    \ the overall growing stage\nFrom the beginning of transplantation to the last\
    \ day, the\noverall growing stage of the crop is determined. It is primarily\n\
    inﬂuenced by the following:\n•\nthe various harvest and its multiplicity,\n•\n\
    the condition of the weather, and\n•\nthe different stages of planting on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\n4.4.2 Manipulation of growth stages\nThe manipulation of the overall\
    \ growing stages of yield is\ndivided into four stages:\n•\nthe analysis of the\
    \ yield ﬁrst stage,\n•\nthe observation of the yield development stage in a ﬁeld,\n\
    •\nthe mid-time cultivation stage, and\n•\nthe late-time growth stage of the crop.\n\

    \ the complete growing\ntime of tomato crop, which is 638 mm.\n5 Simulation setup\
    \ and results analysis\nIn the proposed system, the related experimental data\
    \ are received\nthrough the installed soil moisture and humidity sensor from the\n\
    tomato crop ﬁeld. The NIR REES52 Soil Sensor is used to collect the\npercentage\
    \ of moisture in the soil. Based on this,an irrigation process is\nautomated with\
    \ a developed mobile application which is depicted in\nFigure 4. By using this\
    \ app, the status of soil moisture and the growth of\nplants can be dynamically\
    \ observed, and the irrigation method can also\nbe controlled. Similarly, the\
    \ plant growth parameters like maximum\nheight, width, and diameter of the stem\
    \ of the tomato plant are\nmeasured using an infrared sensor. This is tested in\
    \ a regional area\n28 m in length and 7 m in width, but the experimental site\
    \ is portioned\ninto two rows, and tomatoes are planted 4 m in length and 1.2\
    \ m in\nwidth zone. On the other hand, 50-cm-high PVC plates are applied for\n\
    separation from communities, and a 50-cm row spacing is followed for\nthe plantation\
    \ of tomatoes. Data are captured continuously from the\nﬁeld of cultivation. The\
    \ fog nodes are implemented for sensing data in\nthe area of cultivation. The\
    \ overall implementation of the proposed\nwork is depicted in Figure 5.\nThe cultivation\
    \ time to the collection period is from 1\nNovember 2020 to 18 April 2021, as\
    \ depicted in Figure 6, but it is\ndrawn from the above data (Table 4), which\
    \ is deﬁned in step 5. The\ncultivation of the tomato growth period is evaluated\
    \ as the crop\nsowing period to seedling period (November 1 to December 5), the\n\
    development stage of the crop period (December 6 to January 15),\nthe mid-time\
    \ stage (ﬂowering) of the growth period (January 16 to\nFebruary 5), and the late-time\
    \ stage of growth (fruiting and mature\npicking) period (February 6 to March 30).\
    \ The analysis of irrigation\ndata for tomato cropping depends on the relevant\
    \ factor of the soil\nmoisture sensor at 22 cm depth. This measure predicts the\
    \ volume\nof irrigation.\nBy the observation of moisture level from the above,\
    \ Table 5\nshows a dynamic way of the automatic required level of irrigation\n\
    for tomato cultivation (Figure 7).\nTable 6 shows a feature-wise comparison of\
    \ this paper with the\nexisting literature. The existing work has been mostly\
    \ considered\nunder normal cultivation methods. However, in the proposed work,\n\
    it is found that 5G technology is integrated with the IoT module. As\na result,\
    \ the irrigation system is working intelligently for\nthe cultivation.\nIn Table\
    \ 7, we can see how the 5G network stacks up against\nother existing network generations.\
    \ High-deﬁnition video streaming\nand telephony were made possible on the road\
    \ by 4G networks, an\nimprovement above 3G. As network trafﬁc has increased, the\n\
    theoretical maximum for 4G speeds has been reached. According\nto the ITU, the\
    \ most recent 5G use cases fall into one of three\ncategories: ultrareliable low\
    \ latency communications (URLLC),\nmassive machine type communications (mMTC),\
    \ and enhanced\nmobile broadband (eMBB).\nTable 8 shows that Odisha is in the\
    \ ﬁfth position all over India.\nThis table shows only the seasonal production\
    \ of tomatoes in India.\nIf the display of tomatoes is required to produce in\
    \ non-seasonal\nduration (August to October), then the state Odisha is considered\
    \ in\nthe third position. The implementation of the intelligent cultivation\n\
    method improves the situation in the production table.\nTable 9 shows the exportation\
    \ of tomatoes from India to other\ncountries. The export is done in the seasonal\
    \ duration of\nproduction, but it is required to export in a non-seasonal period\n\
    through intelligent irrigation techniques. Table 10 shows the\nimportation of\
    \ tomatoes to India in the case of seasonal duration.\nThe IoT-based intelligent\
    \ irrigation method provides a technique to\ncultivate tomatoes in the non-seasonal\
    \ period, so that there is no\nneed to import from outside of the country, which\
    \ gives better\nperformance than the traditional cultivation process.\n6 Conclusion\
    \ with future work\nIn this approach, traditional ﬁelds such as agriculture require\n\
    technology (here, smart farming) to achieve higher crop yields with\nless human\
    \ intervention in a limited time frame. Smart farming, on\nthe other hand, necessitates\
    \ signiﬁcant investment, improved\ncoverage and connectivity, and more bandwidth\

  title: 'Smart high-yield tomato cultivation: precision irrigation system using the
    Internet of Things'
  verbatim_quote1: 'The proposed system is integrated with the following components
    which are described below:

    i. Arduino Uno microcontroller:

    It is an open-source microcontroller that can be programmed by writing C or C++
    code to control the overall system automation. After installing and programming
    the Arduino, it is ready to collect the number of inputs from IR moisture soil
    sensors and also provide a remote command to control the irrigation system. However,
    this microcontroller remotely controls the overall execution process.'
  verbatim_quote2: 'ii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:

    Soil moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil property that
    plays a vital role in a variety of farming activities, hydrological processes,
    and environmental concerns. A near-infrared (NIR) reflectance sensor is created
    for the calculation of moisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting
    diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of 1,945 nm and
    a strong water absorption band and the other with a wavelength of 1,850 nm and
    a weak water absorption band. It is linked to an Arduino controller to record
    the moisture level of the soil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to the water
    controller for irrigation in the tomato cultivation land.'
  verbatim_quote3: 'iii. Pinolex drip automatic water controller:

    The smart flower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient way to manage and control tomato
    crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation or anywhere, an automatic water
    timer is set by the Arduino microcontroller, which is useful for watering tomato
    cultivation. It ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm) thread tap. It can water the plants regularly,
    even when no one is at home, and thus improve their survival rate.'

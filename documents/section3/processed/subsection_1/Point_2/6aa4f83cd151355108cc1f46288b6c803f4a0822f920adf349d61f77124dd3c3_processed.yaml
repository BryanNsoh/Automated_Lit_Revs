  analysis: "The paper presents an automated, real-time IoT-driven irrigation management\
    \ system. It provides an end-to-end solution by integrating IoT, machine learning,\
    \ and wireless sensor networks for data collection, transmission, analysis, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Notably, it addresses key aspects of the point in the\
    \ literature review: \n\n1. Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy\
    \ temperature, weather) and their collection and use: The system employs an array\
    \ of sensors to capture various soil and weather parameters such as soil moisture,\
    \ soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction.\
    \ These data are wirelessly transmitted to a weather station for monitoring and\
    \ storage. \n\n2. IoT-connected weather station: The weather station serves as\
    \ a central unit between the IoT cloud and soil sensor nodes. It collects data\
    \ from the sensor nodes and local weather conditions. The collected data are uploaded\
    \ to the IoT cloud for storage and visualization. \n\n3. Machine learning for\
    \ irrigation prediction: The paper employs six different machine learning algorithms\
    \ (LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, SVM) to analyze the collected data and predict irrigation\
    \ needs. The LDA algorithm exhibits the highest accuracy (91.25%) in irrigation\
    \ prediction. \n\nThe paper's main contributions include:\n\n1. Long-range soil\
    \ condition monitoring system using an array of sensors with long-range wireless\
    \ communication modules.\n2. Low-cost IoT-enabled weather station for weather\
    \ condition monitoring.\n3. Utilization of the best machine learning algorithm\
    \ (LDA) to accurately predict irrigation requirements.\n4. IoT-based data storage\
    \ and remote monitoring of soil and weather conditions.\n\nDespite its strengths,\
    \ the paper has limitations: \n\n1. Limited evaluation: The system is tested with\
    \ only two soil sensor nodes and one weather station. A more comprehensive evaluation\
    \ with a larger number of sensors and field deployment would strengthen the findings.\n\
    2. No discussion on data security: The paper does not address data security measures\
    \ for the collected and transmitted data. Providing details on data encryption\
    \ and privacy protection would enhance the system's credibility.\n3. Lack of consideration\
    \ for specific crop requirements: The paper does not delve into the specific irrigation\
    \ needs of different crops. Incorporating crop-specific parameters into the machine\
    \ learning model would improve the system's effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the paper\
    \ presents a valuable framework for automated irrigation management, addressing\
    \ critical aspects of data collection, transmission, and machine learning-based\
    \ irrigation prediction. However, further research and development are recommended\
    \ to enhance the system's robustness, security, and crop-specificity."

    Agriculture is the major portion of GDP in both developing\nand developed countries.\
    \ It has been estimated that the\nworld population will be about 10 billion by\
    \ 2050. To feed\nthe growing population always, food production requires to\n\
    be increased minimum by 70%. Sustainable agriculture\npractices are required in\
    \ agriculture and are keys to ensure\nfood security for growing population. Sustainable\
    \ agricul-\nture aims to enhance the overall agriculture productivity\ntowards\
    \ reducing the negative impact on environment due\nto less eﬃcient agriculture\
    \ practices. Smart agriculture\npractices tend to lack behind in research and\
    \ call for much\nresearch and development (R&D) to achieve goal of sus-\ntainable\
    \ agriculture. One of the areas in agriculture, which\nneeds much attention, is\
    \ irrigation. Extensive irrigation\nmakes use of 70% of the available freshwater\
    \ resources.\nInternet of 'ings (IoT) and machine learning (ML)-based\nsolution\
    \ may help in eﬃcient monitoring, controlling, and\nirrigation scheduling for\
    \ agriculture ﬁelds [1–7].\nMany IoT and ML-based irrigation systems have been\n\
    developed for monitoring and control application. One ir-\nrigation system developed\
    \ integrates sensors and energy\nmodule on the top of sprinkler. Another implementation\n\
    connects soil moisture sensor to Internet for monitoring soil\nmoisture [8], yet\
    \ another system designed for irrigation uses\nair temperature, humidity, and\
    \ air quality for irrigation\nscheduling and ML for data processing [6].\nGround\
    \ water is the main source of socio-economic\ndevelopment, but agriculture is\
    \ using major portion of\nHindawi\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nVolume\

    ground water for irrigation purpose. Since last two decades,\nboth artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) and ML are registering their\npresence in many application areas including\
    \ agriculture.\nML has been used for predicting river ﬂow and water quality\n\
    [9].\nWater management is of paramount importance due to\nits scarcity, and this\
    \ also aﬀects agriculture as major portion\nof fresh water is used for irrigation.\
    \ 'e various methods of\nirrigation as identiﬁed are drip irrigation, spray irrigation,\n\
    nebulizer irrigation, and most used form of irrigation in\nIndia, that is, ﬂood\
    \ irrigation. Soil moisture, humidity, and\ntemperature are some of the some of\
    \ the most observed\nagriculture parameters for irrigation planning. Mainly open-\n\
    source platforms, speciﬁcally Arduino, are utilized as main\nboard in various\
    \ systems developed for irrigation man-\nagement [10].\n'ere is a need of sustainable\
    \ agriculture with minimal\nimpact on environment and maximum productivity, to\
    \ feed\never growing population and monitor eﬃcient utilization of\navailable\
    \ limited fresh water in agriculture for irrigation.\nConventional less eﬃcient\
    \ irrigation practices, which focus\nof past research mainly on monitoring of\
    \ closed greenhouse\nenvironment with low-range technology, high initial cost\
    \ of\nweather monitoring systems, and negligible use of intelligent\nalgorithm\
    \ in irrigation management, has motivated authors\nto propose the present automated\
    \ irrigation systems. Recent\ndevelopments in IoT, wireless sensor networks (WSN),\n\
    information and communication technology (ICT), and ML\nhave further opened new\
    \ opportunities to researchers to-\nwards agriculture. Proper irrigation planning\
    \ aﬀects both\nquality and quantity of agriculture product. IoT and ML\nalong\
    \ with sensor network can facilitate farmers in proper\nirrigation planning and\
    \ eﬃcient utilization of irrigation\nwater.\nIn the present article, a low-cost\
    \ long-range irrigation\nsystem is proposed. 'e proposed system uses ML to predict\n\
    the irrigation requirement by crop. 'e main contributions\nof the present article\
    \ are as follows:\n(1) Long-range soil condition monitoring system. It\nconstitutes\
    \ as array of sensor with long-range\nwireless communication module to communicate\n\
    the soil conditions to weather station.\n(2) Low-cost IoT enables weather station\
    \ for weather\ncondition monitoring. Weather station collects the\nsoil conditions\
    \ from various soil sensor nodes and\ncollects the weather information from sensor\
    \ in-\nstalled on weather station.\n(3) Best ML algorithm for predicting when\
    \ to start\nirrigation.\n(4) IoT-based data storage and remote monitoring of\n\
    soil and weather conditions. Weather station with\nsoil and weather data sends\
    \ the data to IoT cloud for\nstorage and monitoring.\n'e system proposed identiﬁed\
    \ the various communi-\ncation technologies for their communication capabilities,\n\
    scalability and power consumption, and the suitable\nmember s selected for the\
    \ present proposed system. For\nmaking the system intelligent, ML is used, and\
    \ various al-\ngorithms employed in agricultural application are reviewed.\n'e\
    \ review of ML in agriculture provided the most deployed\nalgorithms for agricultural\
    \ application, and based on their\nperformance, the system used linear discriminant\
    \ analysis\n(LDA) for irrigation requirement for decision-making. 'e\nirrigation\
    \ requirement is aﬀected by the weather and soil\nparameters carefully selected\
    \ through extensive literature\nreview. 'e selected soil and weather parameters\
    \ are sensed\nthrough various sensors and are communications to cloud\nfor monitoring.\n\
    'e present article is divided into diﬀerent sections and\nsubsections to present\
    \ the concept and proposed system.\nSection 2 presents the state-of-the-art study,\
    \ identiﬁes the\npresent work on ML, and uses of ML in agriculture, pre-\ncision\
    \ irrigation, and the challenges with the past automated\nirrigation systems.\
    \ Section 3 presents the design of the\nproposed irrigation system and provides\
    \ the testing result\nand data captured by the developed system and thereafter.\n\
    Section 4 provides the ML algorithm with for irrigation\nprediction. In the end,\
    \ Section 5 concludes the ﬁndings of\nthe proposed work.\n'e present study is\
    \ important as the proposed system\nutilizes both soil and weather conditions\
    \ for irrigation\nplanning to come up with eﬃcient irrigation water utili-\nzation\
    \ strategy in agriculture. Other than farmland irrigation\nplanning, the study\
    \ also contributes towards improving the\neconomic condition of farmers by reducing\
    \ higher manual\nsupervision cost and minimizing the negative impact on\nenvironment\
    \ such as freshwater resource pollution and\nchange in soil properties due to\
    \ less eﬃcient irrigation\npractices. IoTand long-range, low-power WSN are the\
    \ most\nadvance technologies in the proposed system and use of ML\nalgorithm that\
    \ makes the system much eﬀective with pre-\ndictive irrigation scheduling.\n2.\
    \ Literature Survey\n'is section presents the status of research in automated\n\
    irrigation\nsystems\nand\nuse\nof\nmachine\nlearning\nin\nagriculture.\n2.1. Machine\
    \ Learning. In ML, data-driven prediction is\ndone by programming the system.\
    \ ML computers are\nequipped with human learning capabilities to learn from\n\
    experience, acquire new knowledge, and improve system\nperformance. Basic elements\
    \ of ML system are raw data, data\npreprocessing, ML algorithms, generalization,\
    \ and decision-\nmaking [11, 12].\nOne of the important applications of ML is\
    \ data mining.\n'e article [13] discussed the supervised learning algorithms\n\
    in ML, and decision tree, neural networks, and instance-\nbased learning are some\
    \ of the important supervised\nlearning algorithms. ML learning is faster in making\
    \ deci-\nsion as compared to humans. 'e various methods of\nlearning as described\
    \ in article are role learning, analog\nlearning, and knowledge discovery. Various\
    \ applications of\n2\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nRETRACTED\nML are ﬁnance,\
    \ telecommunication, marketing, and analysis\nof network [14].\nML is a subbranch\
    \ of AI and gives machines the ca-\npability to learn from experience. ML is quite\
    \ diﬀerent from\nstatistic method, which is based on likelihood, whereas the\n\
    ML provides solution based on certain set of rules. Machine\nlearning gains knowledge\
    \ in the form of experience gathered\nfrom historical data. ML techniques are\
    \ mainly categorized\nin three categories, namely, supervised, unsupervised, and\n\
    reinforcement learning. Classiﬁcation and regression falls\nunder supervised learning,\
    \ while cluster, anomaly detection,\nand dimensionality reduction are the applications\
    \ of un-\nsupervised learning [15, 16].\n2.2. Machine Learning in Precision Agriculture.\
    \ PA also\ncalled digital farming is the technology-driven farm man-\nagement\
    \ system. PA focused on reducing the production\ncost and eﬀect on environment\
    \ while increasing the proﬁt of\nfarmers. ML and IoT are the essential element\
    \ of future\nfarming. Deploying ML in agriculture helps in controlling,\noptimizing\
    \ farm practices, and predicting the weather and\nrainfall. 'e various areas exploiting\
    \ ML are predicting\nweather conditions, soil properties, and crop yield [12].\n\
    In agriculture and other applications, ML oﬀers com-\nputational and analytical\
    \ solutions to diﬀerent types of\ndatasets. Deploying ML for agriculture is quite\
    \ tedious due\nto unavailability of data collecting equipment and un-\navailability\
    \ of trained manpower to handle the collected\ndata. Agriculture yield gets aﬀected\
    \ by many parameters,\nand some of the important parameters are fertility of soil,\n\
    climatic conditions, water availability, pests, and crop dis-\nease. Rainfall,\
    \ wind speed, solar radiations, heat ﬂux,\nevapotranspiration, and temperature\
    \ are few of the major\nfactors aﬀecting the crop yield [15].\nIoT, WSN, and ICT\
    \ have potential to take care of the\nvarious challenges posed to agriculture.\
    \ AI has been\ndeployed for weather, water usage monitoring, energy, and\nsoil\
    \ health analysis. AI can be helpful in training robots for\nharvesting and other\
    \ similar kinds of labour-intensive ag-\nricultural activities. ML is a branch\
    \ of AI and, along with\nICT, is used for smarter data analysis. ML has been used\
    \ in\ncrop management, livestock management, soil management,\nand water management.\
    \ ML does help in predicting crop\nyield, weed detection, and phenotype classiﬁcation.\
    \ 'e use\nof AI, IoT, robotics, and WSN is on upswing in agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Recent advances in IoT, WSN, and ICT have\nfurther triggered their deployment\
    \ in agriculture. With AI,\nweather conditions, water usage, and soil condition\
    \ can be\nanalysed by farmers for better decision [16].\n'e various agricultural\
    \ practices where technology is\nplaying an important role are animal welfare,\
    \ livestock\nmanagement, yield prediction, disease detection, weed de-\ntection,\
    \ crop quality, species recognition, water manage-\nment, and soil management.\
    \ Only 10% of the research has\nfocus on water management, and more than 61% of\
    \ the\nresearch has been focused on crop management. Moreover,\nwater management,\
    \ that is, water quality and irrigation,\nplays an important role in crop management.\
    \ 'e various\nagricultural areas getting beneﬁtted from ML are crop yield\nprediction,\
    \ crop disease detection, crop weed detection,\nlivestock welfare, and many more\
    \ as summarized in Figure 1.\nSupport vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour\n\
    (KNN), and Gaussian naive Bayes (NB) are some of the ML\nalgorithms, which are\
    \ used in majority of the agriculture\npractices [17].\nRemote sensing such as\
    \ satellite and photography is also\nused to build better decisive system in precision\
    \ agriculture.\n'e aim of the precision agriculture is to reduce the pro-\nduction\
    \ cost and impact on environment. Weather condi-\ntions, soil properties, irrigation,\
    \ and fertilization are some of\nthe parameters aﬀecting the crop yield. Much\
    \ attention is\ngiven to ML as being able to process data from various\nsources\
    \ and can work with nonlinear data. ML needs\nminimal or no human intervention\
    \ and incorporates better\nknowledge-based system. ML has been used for detecting\n\
    biotic stress of crop, disease detection in crops, determining\nphysiological\
    \ and structural properties of plant, and sug-\ngesting automatic irrigation.\
    \ SVM and KNN are the two ML\nalgorithms used extensively in various agriculture\
    \ applica-\ntions [18].\n2.3. Precision Irrigation Models and Challenges. Traditional\n\
    irrigation practices result in excessive application of water\nresulting in ﬁeld\
    \ runoﬀ and pollution in freshwater re-\nsources. A ML-based algorithm is built\
    \ with the gathered\ndataset to predict the allowable time for irrigation. Five\n\
    diﬀerent ML algorithms were compared based on mean\nsquare error. Ridge regression\
    \ oﬀers the least mean square\nerror and has been selected as the best match for\
    \ irrigation\nprediction [19].\nAgriculture sector particularly for irrigation\
    \ consumes\nmajority of the fresh water. Scarcity of fresh water and use of\n\
    traditional less eﬃcient irrigation practices in agriculture has\nignited the\
    \ use of advanced and intelligent technologies for\nirrigation monitoring, controlling,\
    \ and scheduling. IoT and\nML are oﬀering the better techniques in developing\
    \ intel-\nligent solutions for irrigation. An intelligent irrigation\nsystem is\
    \ developed using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Soil\ntemperature, humidity, UV radiations,\
    \ and air temperature\nare the parameters observed for the developed irrigation\n\
    monitoring and control system. For communicating the\nmeasured parameters, short-range\
    \ communication tech-\nnology ZigBee has been deployed. HTTP-based web server\n\
    and IoT-controlled water pump are the other elements of the\ndeveloped intelligent\
    \ system. Soil moisture and need of\nirrigation are predicted by applying SVM\
    \ and KNN ML\nalgorithms to soil temperature, humidity, UV radiations,\nand air\
    \ temperature, which measured through sensors with\nweather forecast information\
    \ [20].\nIoT along with WSN, mobile computing, and intelligent\nagricultural machinery\
    \ has succoured farmers to adopt\nvarious PA practices. An irrigation control\
    \ system is de-\nveloped using data from twenty-two soil sensors for a period\n\
    of two years to develop ML algorithm. Various regression\nand classiﬁcation methods\
    \ were applied to the dataset. Out\nof the ML algorithms selected, Gradient Boost\
    \ Regression\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n3\nRETRACTED\ngave 93% of accuracy\
    \ in prediction and the best performance\nwas given by Boosted Tree Classiﬁer\
    \ with 95% of accuracy in\npredicting the irrigation requirement. Evapotranspiration,\n\
    the indirect method for estimating the crop’s water need,\nwas used to estimate\
    \ the irrigation requirement using wind\nspeed, humidity, and solar radiations\
    \ to measure through\nsensors [21].\nEighty-ﬁve percentage (85%) of fresh water\
    \ is utilized by\nagriculture particularly for irrigation [22]. For the eﬃcient\n\
    use of fresh water in agriculture, intelligent IoT-based ir-\nrigation systems\
    \ are required for monitoring, controlling,\nand scheduling of irrigation. Based\
    \ on short-range com-\nmunication technology, AI, ML, and remote sensing, dif-\n\
    ferent intelligent irrigation models have been developed.\nFew of the developed\
    \ smart solutions of irrigation are\nsummarized in Table 1. In Table 1, the last\
    \ column also\nprovides the challenges in the developed system, which\nneeds to\
    \ be addressed to develop a better solution for in-\ntelligent irrigation system.\n\
    3. System Design and Testing\nAs mentioned in Table 1, the challenges faced with\
    \ present\nautomated irrigation systems are short range, complex de-\nsign, limited\
    \ use of knowledge-based ML techniques, and\nﬁltering out of certain important\
    \ agriculture parameters. 'e\nsystem proposed in the present article focuses to\
    \ address\nmajority of the challenges. 'e proposed intelligent irriga-\ntion system\
    \ comprises soil monitoring sensor nodes, IoT-\nconnected weather station, IoT\
    \ cloud for data storage and\nmonitoring, and ML algorithms for the prediction\
    \ of irri-\ngation need. 'e agriculture parameters observed, as\nidentiﬁed from\
    \ literature survey section, for proposed ir-\nrigation decision support system,\
    \ which are soil tempera-\nture, soil moisture, air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ wind\nspeed, and wind direction.\nPutting together Internet of 'ings (IoT) which\
    \ is\nscalable long-range, low-power wireless communication,\nand machine learning\
    \ algorithm in the proposed system\nmake it more advanced and reliable. System\
    \ uses multiple\nsoil sensor nodes for farmland monitoring. Soil sensor nodes\n\
    are equipped with soil moisture sensor, soil temperature\nsensor, and LoRa wireless\
    \ communicating module. With the\nLoRa technology, soil sensor nodes can be installed\
    \ upto a\nrange of 1 km to 1.5 km [28–30], although the module\ndeployed claims\
    \ range upto 8 km and enables to monitor the\nlarger farmland.\nWeather station\
    \ other than capturing the local weather\nconditions also acts as a central unit\
    \ between IoT cloud and\nsoil sensor nodes. Weather station observes air temperature,\n\
    relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Weather\nand soil conditions\
    \ (from soil sensor nodes) are sent to IoT\ncloud for storage and monitoring.\
    \ 'ingSpeak IoT cloud is\nused being available with no cost for upto 8 channels\
    \ and\nprovides good data visualization in graphical form. Figure 2\ngives the\
    \ block diagram of the proposed system.\n'e system is tested with two soil sensor\
    \ nodes, as shown\nin Figure 3, and weather station, as shown in Figure 4.\n'e\
    \ weather station uploads the soil and weather con-\ndition data to 'ingSpeak\
    \ IoT cloud. 'ingSpeak IoT cloud\nprovides data visualization in graphical form,\
    \ and data\nuploaded can be downloaded in “.csv” form for analysis. 'e\nmobile\
    \ interface for data visualization is shown in Figure 5.\n'e captured weather\
    \ station data are compared with the\nweather data from https://www.worldweatheronline.com\
    \ as\nshown in Tables 2 and 3.\nFrom the three days of observation, maximum diﬀerence\n\
    in temperature from the two sources of data was 1.4°C. For\nhumidity, the diﬀerence\
    \ between the two sources of data was\nmeasured as 2% and wind speed diﬀers by\
    \ maximum of\n1 kmph. 'e developed system performs satisfactorily, as the\nobserved\
    \ data in within the limits of sensors [10].\n4. Machine Learning Modelling for\n\

    \ world\npopulation needs modernization of agriculture. For food\nsecurity to\
    \ increased population, reducing impact on en-\nvironment and eﬃcient utilization\
    \ of irrigation water ag-\nriculture needs to adapt modern technologies. IoT,\
    \ ICT,\nWSN, and ML provide intelligent solutions to agriculture\npractices including\
    \ irrigation. Many irrigation models have\nbeen developed, but they neglect one\
    \ or the other important\naspects of either technology or agriculture. An advanced\n\
    knowledge-based long-range scalable irrigation decision\nsupport system is proposed\
    \ in the present paper. 'e pro-\nposed design tries to address some, or all the\
    \ challenges faced\nin present automated irrigation systems and providing the\n\
    cost-eﬀective solution. 'e cost comparison of developed\nweather station with\
    \ some of the available commercial\nweather stations is provided in Table 5. Weather\
    \ stations\nwith the cost of eve as high as Rs 32500/- are not supported\nwith\
    \ IoT. 'e weather station developed for the proposed\nsystem cost 50%–60% less\
    \ than as mentioned weather sta-\ntions in Table 5.\nWeather and soil conditions\
    \ are observed for the\nproposed irrigation support system. 'e use of scalable\n\
    long-range, low-power communication technology in\nsoil sensor nodes gives systems\
    \ the ability to monitor\nlarger ﬁelds with more accuracy. IoT cloud is used for\n\
    weather and soil data visualization eliminating the re-\nquirement of local storage\
    \ and display. Knowledge-based\nML technique is used for making decision regarding\n\
    irrigation. Six diﬀerent linear and nonlinear ML algo-\nrithms are used with the\
    \ observed dataset, and their\naccuracy in predicting irrigation is calculated.\
    \ 'e best\neﬃciency of 91.25% was observed with LDA algorithm.\nAfter selecting\
    \ the eﬃcient ML algorithm, the selected\nalgorithm is tested for the diﬀerent\
    \ soil and weather\nconditions for decision-making. 'e intelligent irrigation\n\
    decisive support system was successfully able to monitor\nsoil and weather condition\
    \ of farmland using IoT and\nmakes correct decision regarding irrigation.\nData\

  limitations: '1. Limited evaluation: The system is tested with only two soil sensor
    nodes and one weather station. A more comprehensive evaluation with a larger number
    of sensors and field deployment would strengthen the findings.

    2. No discussion on data security: The paper does not address data security measures
    for the collected and transmitted data. Providing details on data encryption and
    privacy protection would enhance the system''s credibility.

    3. Lack of consideration for specific crop requirements: The paper does not delve

    PDF TOOLS SHARE ABSTRACT This work is aimed at presenting the water saving potentialities
    of a scalable smart irrigation system applied to precision agriculture. A fuzzy
    logic strategy is integrated in a distributed monitoring system based on the wireless
    sensor network technology. The optimal irrigation schedule is adaptively estimated
    according to the real-time measurement of the soil status and the weather conditions.
    The objective of the system is to optimize the water content in the soil to (i)
    maximize the health status of the plants, (ii) improve the quality of the products,
    and (iii) reduce the waste of water. The proposed system has been prototyped and
    experimentally validated in an apple orchard, close to the city of Trento, in
    the north of Italy. The performances of the proposed system are compared with
    those of a standard irrigation scheduler to point out the amount of saved water
    as well as the improved stability of the soil moisture level. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,
    Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 58:2186–2189, 2016 1 INTRODUCTION The irrigation
    in agriculture considerably impacts on the global water consumption (up to 80–90%
    in the developed countries), and the water withdrawal is expected to increase
    by 20% before 2050 1. A more efficient exploitation of water resources is mandatory
    to guarantee the sustainable food production for the fast growing world population
    2. The information and communication technologies have been recognized as fundamental
    tools to support the technological advancements in the management of the agricultural
    processes. In this framework, the wireless sensor network (WSN) technology 3 has
    been applied to enable the distributed monitoring of different physical parameters.
    The WSN properties such as the scalability, low-cost, self-configurability, and
    multi-sensing have stimulated the diffusion of small and low-power wireless sensors
    to implement the so-called “precision agriculture” 4-6. However, even if the sensing
    technologies and their integration in embedded wireless devices are available
    in the state-of-the-art (also commercial products exist nowadays), advanced methodologies
    for the sensor data processing and for the adaptive control of the irrigation
    systems have been less investigated. To the best of the author''s knowledge, the
    actuation strategies are limited to preliminary studies or to proprietary and
    customized management software, often calibrated for specific irrigation modalities
    and equipment. The dissemination of research results as well as their critical
    analysis and comparison with the performance of standard irrigation methods is
    only partially documented. In this paper, an actuation strategy based on the fuzzy
    logic 7 for the unsupervised estimation of the optimal irrigation schedule is
    proposed. The heuristically defined rules have been defined starting from the
    empirical knowledge of expert farmers in order to adaptively apply the human experience
    to the time-varying conditions of the monitored field. The real-time and distributed
    acquisition of the soil parameters is performed by the wireless nodes of a WSN-based
    measurement system, while the irrigation is managed by a set of wireless actuator
    nodes, which control the valves according to the output of the fuzzy logic. The
    system prototype has been deployed in an apple orchard for experimental validation.
    A selected set of experimental results are reported and discussed to show the
    improved quality of the irrigation obtained with the proposed approach, which
    has led to a better soil condition in comparison to the one achieved by a standard
    irrigation method based on a fixed daily schedule. 2 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
    Let us consider a set of K = N + M wireless nodes, N and M being the sensing (Fig.
    1) and actuation (Fig. 2) nodes, respectively, deployed in known and fixed positions
    rk, k =1,…,K, within the monitored area Ω. Each sensing node is equipped with
    multiple sensors for the acquisition of the soil temperature τ(n), n = 1,…,N,
    and the soil humidity h(n) (dp), where dp, p = 1,…,P, are the depths of the buried
    sensors. The wireless nodes are interconnected by means of radio-frequency links
    (f being the working frequency of the IEEE802.15.4 transceivers) to enable the
    collection of the sensor data towards the control unit, and the transmission of
    the irrigation commands to the actuation nodes. Each actuation node is interconnected
    to an irrigation valve, which controls the sprinklers installed in different spatial
    sub-domains Ωm, m = 1,…,M. The irrigation commands sent to each actuation node
    are independent and evaluated according to the status of the culture within the
    different sub-domains. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sensing device—Smart
    wireless sensor with multiple soil probes. [Color figure can be viewed in the
    online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] Figure 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Actuation device—Irrigation valve controlled by the WSN
    actuator node. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The default status of the irrigation valves is “closed”
    and changes to “open” for the irrigation time α(m) (t), m = 1,…,M, computed by
    the fuzzy logic at the time instant t. The computation of the irrigation time
    is iteratively repeated at the discrete time instants tz =t0 +zΔt, z = 0,…,Z −
    1, where Δt is the time interval. Each irrigation time α(m) (t) is evaluated as
    (1) where Sm, m = 1,…,M, are the subset of nodes located in rn ∊Ωm, m = 1,…,M,
    n = 1,…,N. The proposed fuzzy logic strategy is implemented following the block
    scheme shown in Figure 3. First, the humidity measured ad different depths are
    averaged to obtain a single representative value of the soil moisture in rn, n
    = 1,…,N. Successively, such a value is compared with the desired humidity threshold
    hth. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Block scheme of the proposed fuzzy
    logic strategy. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The differential value Δh(n) together with the soil
    temperature τ(n) are used as inputs of the fuzzy logic system, which operates
    according to a set of predefined rules, composed by Γi, i = 1,…,I antecedents
    and Λ j, j = 1,…,J relative consequences, as described in Ref. 8. Gaussian membership
    functions ψ(·) are associated to the input samples and the fuzzifier process is
    applied to evaluate the degree of similarity with the antecedents. Finally, the
    output of the defuzzifier provides the irrigation time α(n) evaluated as the center
    of the activated areas of the consequences. 3 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION A set of
    K = 30 (N= 27 and M = 3) nodes have been manufactured and deployed in a real test
    field within an apple orchard of size 5000 [m2]. The irrigation system has been
    divided in three sub-domains Ωm, m = 1,…,M, M = 3, in order to compare the proposed
    fuzzy logic strategy applied in the zone Ω1, with the standard irrigation schedule
    (zone Ω2) and the absence of irrigation in zone Ω3. Each sensing node has P =
    3 humidity sensors, buried at the depths d1 =0.2[m], d2 = 0.5 [m], and d3 = 0.8[m],
    and one soil temperature sensor. The data acquisition and transmission (the working
    frequency of the IEEE802.15.4-compliant transceivers is f = 868 [MHz]) is iterated
    with time interval Δt = 600 [s]. The humidity threshold is set to hth =30 [%].
    Besides the WSN infrastructure, a weather station equipped with a rain gauge has
    been installed in the proximity of the test field to take in consideration the
    effects of the rain level ρ on the soil humidity. Concerning the fuzzy logic,
    a customized combination of I = 6 triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian antecedents
    Γi (Δh,τ) (Δh ranging from Extremely Dry to DUmp [Fig. 4(a)], and τ from Very
    Cold to WArm [Fig. 4(b)]) and J = 5 triangular consequences Λj(Δh, τ) (α (n) from
    Null to Long [Fig. 4(c)]) have been configured according to the suggestions of
    the expert farmers involved in the irrigation management. Figure 4 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Fuzzy logic rules—Antecedents for humidity (a) and temperature
    (b), and consequences (c). [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which
    is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The measurement campaign has been performed
    both in autumn and in summer periods. For the sake of brevity, a representative
    week (Z = 1152 acquisitions) during the summer period has been selected to analyse
    the daily performance of the system in presence of time-varying weather conditions.
    Figure 5 shows the soil status in the three sub-domains of the apple orchard,
    where the three different irrigation strategies have been applied: r20 (no irrigation),
    r14 (standard irrigation), and r5 (fuzzy logic strategy). Three rain events happened
    during the selected days and the soil moisture level changed accordingly, as clearly
    shown in Figure 55a). The absence of irrigation in highlighted the very high correlation
    between the soil humidity and the rain. The humidity rapidly increased from low
    values ( ) up to short and isolated peaks ( ), and decreased according to the
    soil evapotranspiration. Concerning the effects of the standard irrigation schedule,
    a higher soil humidity has been measured in r14 [Fig. 5(b)], as expected. In the
    sub-domain Ω2, the valve of the actuator m = 2 has been opened every day for a
    fixed time slot and provided a constant irrigation time αstd, regardless the weather
    and soil conditions. Figure 5(b) clearly points out that the humidity is higher
    than the desired threshold, especially during the rain events, since any adaptive
    calibration of the irrigation time has been considered. Figure 5 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Experimental validation without irrigation (a), with standard
    irrigation schedule (b), and with the proposed fuzzy logic strategy (c). [Color
    figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]
    In order to assess the performance of the proposed fuzzy-based irrigation strategy,
    the indicator has been defined as (2) where 0 ≤ α (tz) ≤ α std. Lower values of
    σ(n) indicate that a more stable soil humidity is obtained with a lower quantity
    of water, and this reflects in a higher irrigation efficiency. Such an indicator
    has been evaluated for the standard and fuzzy-based irrigation approaches, the
    value σ(14) =0.56 has been obtained with the standard irrigation, while the proposed
    fuzzy logic strategy reached a lower value σ(5) =0.15. As shown in Figure 5(c),
    the adaptive control of the irrigation time has guaranteed a higher stability
    of soil humidity, which is closer to the reference value hth even in presence
    of time-varying weather conditions. 4 CONCLUSION In this letter, a wireless system
    for the advanced management of the irrigation in smart farming applications has
    been presented. A customized methodology based on a fuzzy logic strategy has been
    integrated in a WSN-based sensing and actuation system for the adaptive evaluation
    of the best irrigation time. The proposed solution has been experimentally validated
    in an apple orchard and the irrigation efficiency has been improved more than
    40 [%] respect to the standard irrigation approach. The obtained results pointed
    out a more accurate exploitation of the irrigation water with positive effects
    on the stability of the soil moisture level, which reflects on the health status
    of the crops and the quality of the products. REFERENCES Citing Literature Volume58,

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been highly developed
    which can be used in agriculture to enable optimal irrigation scheduling. Since
    there is an absence of widely used available methods to support effective agriculture
    practice in different weather conditions, WSN technology can be used to optimise
    irrigation in the crop fields. This paper presents architecture of an irrigation
    system by incorporating interoperable IP based WSN, which uses the protocol stacks
    and standard of the Internet of Things paradigm. The performance of fundamental
    issues of this network is emulated in Tmote Sky for 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4
    radio link using the Contiki OS and the Cooja simulator. The simulated results
    of the performance of the WSN architecture presents the Round Trip Time (RTT)
    as well as the packet loss of different packet size. In addition, the average
    power consumption and the radio duty cyde of the sensors are studied. This will
    facilitate the deployment of a scalable and interoperable multi hop WSN, positioning
    of border router and to manage power consumption of the sensors. Notes: This article

    Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction Shortage of fresh water is a common
    problem in the world. The demand for water supplies is expected to increase due
    to population growth; food demand needs, and changes in water availability. Irrigation
    is a primary user of freshwater, with the Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO, 2014) reporting that 70% of freshwater in the world is
    used for irrigation purposes. Irrigation is expected to be much more crucial for
    the food production in the near future, as most probable climate change scenarios
    predict large water deficits in certain areas in the world. Irrigation holds the
    most promise for increasing food productivity and security, provided it is managed
    efficiently. Also irrigation consumes large quantities of energy, which is a crucial
    constraint for development. To better manage the competing demands for water,
    agricultural policies will have to make water efficiency a priority. Hence the
    scientific and technology based irrigation scheduling of water is one of the ways
    to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the use of water and energy consumption.
    The incorporation of sensors in the context of agricultural production for water
    management and conservation has concerned an increasing interest for establishing
    irrigation management strategies. The use of water for agricultural production
    in water scarcity regions requires innovative and sustainable research and an
    appropriate transfer of technologies. Moreover, food security is an important
    issue since systems aiming at ensuring optimal production of crops form a vital
    part of any country''s overall security system. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing
    are key technologies significantly contributing to the advent of IoT. They bring
    computation capability to physical objects, which can communicate, in the Internet
    by producing, consuming, and computing information. WSNs are a prevalent instance
    of ubiquitous computing that enables small things to connect to the Internet.
    Sensor networks today are sensing and computing environmental phenomena and thus
    such a WSN can be used in real time application like irrigation scheduling. In
    reality these types of networks are heterogeneous by nature, arises from the fact
    that there are different types of WSN devices that do not use the same standards.
    The migration of WSN communication towards an all-IP mode, eliminate most of the
    heterogeneity. The Internet is smoothly migrating from an Internet of people towards
    an Internet of Things (IoT). Such a migration induces a strong level of complexity
    when handling interoperability between the heterogeneous IoT and also these types
    of networks are low power and lossy network. To support the connectivity, interoperability
    ad compatibility of heterogeneous WSN, IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area
    Network (6LoWPAN) was proposed by the IETF working group. Therefore the system
    proposed in this paper uses the wireless sensor networks and the architecture
    of Internet of things, allowing the users to analyze the moisture level of the
    field obtained by the array of sensors from any smart device in efficient way
    to take the decision of irrigation scheduling. This paper presents a multi hop
    WSN for smart irrigation scheduling that relies on 6LoWPAN, RPL and IEEE 802.15.4g
    protocols along with the performance evaluation of the WSN in terms of round trip
    time, packet loss and radio duty cycles of the sensors. The remainder of this
    paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 covers related work, whereas
    Section 3 presents our proposed system architecture. Section 4 includes details
    on our prototype design, while Section 5 conveys information about the simulations
    performed. Section 6 presents our results and the analysis performed, while Section
    7 finally concludes the paper and indicates future work. SECTION II. Related Work
    In GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) based automated irrigation control
    using rain gun [1] irrigation will take place only when there will be intense
    requirement of water that save a large quantity of water. This system is not affordable
    economically due to coverage range of agriculture land. Siuli Roy et al. [2] proposed
    a Zigbee based wireless sensor network with the help of IEEE 802.15.4 link layer
    protocol. This work focuses to monitor agricultural parameter remotely and to
    control irrigation and fertilization. Evapotranspiration (ET) is affected by solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and crop factors, such as stage
    of growth, variety and plant density, management elements, soil properties, pest,
    and disease control [3]. Systems based on ET have been developed that agree to
    water savings of up to 42% on time-based irrigation program [4]. To monitor the
    agricultural system a microcontroller based system developed by Zeldi [5], where
    the real time values of atmospheric condition displayed by the microcontroller
    by sensing of different parameters of agriculture like soil moisture, humidity
    and temperature. An electromagnetic moisture sensor was the basis for developing
    an irrigation system at a savings of 53% of water compared with irrigation by
    sprinklers in an area of 1000 m2 of territory [6]. By using soil sensor and an
    evaporimeter [7], to adjust the irrigation in different weather conditions, a
    scheduling system was developed to reduce the water consumption. However no performance
    analysis was made to look after the power consumption and fundamental issues of
    6LoWPAN protocol stack in these studies. These issues made us to decide to study
    the performances of irrigation system through Cooja Simulator. Since 6LoWPAN is
    an immerging technology and is suitable for constraint environment, smart irrigation
    based on this stack can be a new application area. The purpose of this research
    is to develop a smart irrigation system using 6LoWPAN wireless sensor network
    [8]–[13] and analyze the performances of the WSN. The system will be integrated
    with wireless sensor network technology where solar energy can be used to overcome
    the power crisis along with optimizing the irrigation management based on the
    6LWAN standard. Our own previous work includes performance analysis of an IP based
    protocol stack for WSNs [14] [15]. SECTION III. System Architecture Fig. 1 depicts
    the systems architecture to implement real time irrigation scheduling in a crop
    field. Fig. 1. Proposed system architecture Show All The architecture consists
    of a LoWPAN wireless sensor network, an IoT gateway for Internet connectivity,
    a web server to store sensor data, application software implementing our decision
    support system to provide irrigation scheduling, and a control system for interfacing
    and controlling the irrigation pumps. A LoWPAN is the collection of 6LoWPAN Nodes,
    which share a common IPv6 address, prefix. LoWPAN are connected to other IP networks
    through edge routers or border router. The edge router plays an important role
    as it routes traffic in and out of the LoWPAN, while handling 6LoWPAN compression
    and neighbor discovery for the LoWPAN. Multiple edge routers can be supported
    in the same LoWPAN if they share a common backbone link. Each LoWPAN node is identified
    by a unique IPv6 address, and is capable of sending and receiving IPv6 packets.
    Typically LoWPAN Nodes support ICMPv6 traffic such as ping and use the user datagram
    protocol (UDP) as a transport protocol. In the WSN, the upper leftmost sensor
    node acts as edge router as well as sink node and also the root of directed acyclic
    graph formed by the network topology. The rest of the nodes act as source nodes
    and send their sensing data to the sink node, which then forwards to the destination
    server through the gateway. To connect the WSN with the Internet backbone, a gateway
    is deployed between edge router and the LoWPAN. The gateway enables the connectivity
    of the LoWPAN to the Internet. Hence sensor data from the radio network can be
    transmitted to the server located anywhere in the Internet. The server in the
    architecture is used to collect and store the sensors data. The sensors sense
    moisture level of the crop field and forward the data to the server through the
    gateway. We can implement the server as a cloud from where the farmer, user or
    client retrieves sensor data to analysis for making decision such as moisture
    level, to make irrigation scheduling. The web based decision support system (DSS)
    analyzes the real time moisture level of the crop field and provides users with
    an irrigation schedule for crops during different phases of phonological development
    based on moisture level. If the DSS recommends for irrigation, then the user send
    a positive flag to the control system which then switches on the relay driver
    to turn on the irrigation pump. A relay is an electromagnetic switch operated
    by a relatively small electric current that can switch a much larger electric
    device. The LED in the microcontroller indicates the ON and OFF states of the
    relay circuit. Here we propose the source of energy for the pump is solar renewable
    energy due to power crisis of Bangladesh and remote location of the crop field.
    SECTION IV. Prototype Desgin We have implemented a prototype of smart irrigation
    system. A moisture sensor is used to detect the moisture. An Arduino Uno board
    is used to control whole system. The Arduino module compares the moisture level
    of the field with the threshold moisture level. Arduino will instruct the pump
    to be activated if the moisture of the field is smaller than the set threshold.
    When the moisture level is more than the threshold, the irrigation will be stopped
    by the Arduino. A solar system is used to provide the power need for this system.
    Fig. 2 presents the prototype implementation of our proposed system. Fig. 2. Prototype
    implementation of smart irrigation system Show All SECTION V. Simulation Scenario
    To closely reflect real deployments, nodes run Contiki OS with the whole protocol
    stack. We have compiled Contiki for the Tmote Sky platform based on MSP430 microcontroller
    with 10 KB of RAM and an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio. By using the MSP430 hardware
    emulator, Cooja thus takes into account all the hardware constraints of the devices.
    The simulation scenario is presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. WSN topology and radio
    environment in cooja. The green disk represents the transmission range and the
    gray disk represents the interference range of the sensor. The yellow nodes are
    source nodes while the blue node is the sink node. Show All The propagation model
    used in the simulations is COOJA''s Unit Disk Graph Medium (UDGM) with constant
    loss. This model uses two concentric disks of different radius. Any node within
    the transmission range receives transmitted packets with a probability of 100%
    (default value). Any node within the interference range but outside of the transmission
    range is not able to receive any packets but see its own transmissions affected.
    Finally nodes outside of the interference range are not able to receive packets
    and are not affected by transmitted packets. The border router or edge router
    is typically a device sitting at the edge of our network, which allows us to talk
    to outside networks using its built-in network interfaces, such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet,
    Serial, etc. In Contiki the current and most used border router application implements
    a serial based interface called SLIP, it allows to connect a given mote to a host
    using scripts like tunslip6 over the serial port, creating a tunneled network
    interface, which can be given an IPv6 prefix to set the network global IPv6 addresses.
    Node 1 corresponds to the border router, which has only one neighbor in its wireless
    coverage area the sensors are deployed to establish multi hops network from the
    border router. The simulation parameters including the protocol stack used are
    shown below in Table 1. For capturing data collected from sensors we use Collect
    view visualization tool provided by the Contiki OS. Table 1. Simulation parameters
    SECTION VI. Results and Analysis To illustrate the performance of the proposed
    WSN scenario we evaluate three important parameters named round trip time as delay,
    packet loss and energy consumption (radio duty cycle and average power consumption.
    This evaluation also tests the RPL routing protocol used in 6LoWPAN, as the scenario
    features nodes with 1 to 4 hops to the router. A. Round Trip Time (RTT) The RTT
    is an important parameter of concern as it is an indicator of the network congestion
    as well as the processing delays. It is computed as function of time by the ping
    request as the time difference between the time of successful response for a request
    and the time instant at which the request is sent. In our simulation, payload
    size is varied from 8 bytes to 56 bytes. Twenty ICMP messages are sent to each
    source node in the WSN through the border router from Contiki client and the statistics
    of round trip time are recorded and plotted in Matlab simulation software. The
    plots below illustrate minimum RTT, maximum RTT, median RTT and deviations of
    RTT for different packet size and multi hop scenarios. It can be seen from Fig.
    4 and Fig. 5 that packets moving further away from the sink experience higher
    RTT, as expected and with the higher payload, the RTT is also higher especially
    in multi hop cases. Fig. 7 presents cumulative distribution function (CDF) as
    a function of deviation of RTT for different hop counts, while Fig. 8 shows packet
    loss for different hop. Fig. 4. Minimum RTT Show All Fig. 5. Maximum RTT Show
    All Fig. 6. Median of RTT Show All Fig. 7. CDF of deviation of RTT for different
    hops Show All Fig. 8. Packet loss for different hop Show All Fig. 9. Average power
    consumption of the source nodes Show All Fig. 10. Average power consumption of
    the source nodes Show All B. Packet Loss The ping ICMP request sent by the client
    computer in the simulation scenario, which are not acknowledges within the specific
    waiting time determines the packet loss. Packet loss occurs in wsn networks due
    to noise, interference and collisions. The scenario is simulated in Cooja by considering
    TX with 100% and RX with 90%. The statistics of packet loss is obtained from the
    reply of ping ICMP packets. Fig. 2 illustrates the packet loss for the scenario.
    It is seen that the packet loss increase as the packet size and hop increases.
    C. Energy Consumption In this section, we look at the energy consumption of nodes
    under the ContikiMAC protocols. We use the duty cycle as an estimator of the energy
    consumption. The lower the duty cycle, the longer the nodes batteries should last.
    ContikiMAC is a suitable and energy efficient radio duty cycle mechanism (RDC)
    for sensor networks running Contiki. Contiki has a power efficient wake-up mechanism
    and uses a fast sleep optimization to allow receivers to quickly detect false
    positive wake-ups. It also uses a transmission optimization to allow run time
    optimization of the energy efficiency of transmission. The ContikiMAC implementation
    in Contiki 2.5 uses the Contiki real-time timers (rtimer) to schedule its periodic
    wake ups. The ContikiMAC wake-up mechanism runs a protothread, which performs
    the periodic wake, ups and implements the fast sleep optimization. The phase-lock
    mechanism is implemented as a separate module from ContikiMAC, which maintains
    a list of neighbors and their wake-up phases. The neighbor is evicted from the
    list after a fixed number of failed transmissions or having no link layer ack
    within a fixed time. In our experiments, the default parameters of ContikiMAC
    have been used. Due to the fast sleep optimization the duty-cycle of ContikiMAC
    is dynamic. The most important contribution to the ContikiMAC reduction in duty-cycle
    is the fast sleep optimization at the heart of the wake-up procedure. The Duty
    Cycle provides information regarding the energy consumption of a node by evaluating
    the time spent by a node in the following states: listen, RX, TX. The Duty Cycle
    is expressed as the ratio between the time spent by a node in those three states
    and the wake-up interval. The Duty Cycle value is computed via the Cooja Power
    tracker tool. The visualizations of radio duty cycle and average power consumption
    have been collected using the Cooja collect view tool and are presented in Fig.
    9 and Fig. 10. From Fig. 8 we observe that the node 5 and 9 experience less duty
    cycle than other nodes in the network as these are not intermediate node and generate
    less traffic. Consequently the average power consumption is also less in these
    two nodes for the same. SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The purpose of
    this paper is to apply the functionality of Internet of things in the field of
    agriculture such as smart irrigation to provide optimum use of fresh water and
    better crops production. The main components of the paper are the system architecture
    for irrigation control system, the analysis of the performance of the 6LoWPAN
    protocol stack, Contiki OS and RPL routing protocol in terms of round trip time,
    packet loss and energy consumption, also investigation of the interoperability
    between heterogeneous network. Based on simulation we observe that the RTT and
    percentage of packet loss will increase as the hop and the payload size become
    larger due to environmental noise such as interference, collision and link quality.
    Radio Duty Cycle is a lifetime indicator of the sensors. It is observed from the
    result that less power consumption means less RDC and hence more lifetime of the
    sensors. ContikiMAC use a RDC protocol that is responsible for power saving mechanism.
    The stack simulated in this work is interoperable as it can be connected to different
    motes platform and does not require gateway to connect to the Internet. Cooja
    enables emulator with real hardware motes, which make the network simple and reusable.
    In addition to it, we browse the contents of the sensors from Mozilla browser
    using Copper plug-in, which implement the CoAP protocol. In a nutshell, one can
    decide the scalability of WSN in terms of multi hops, positioning of border router,
    desired latency and data uncertainty in terms of packet loss for real time application
    of IoT like smart irrigation systems. In the future we intend to implement this
    system in a real field scenario so that performance can be analyzed along with
    the development of web based DSS. There is also an opportunity to analyze the
    real time data streaming where a lot of data will be transmitted by sensors. We
    also plan to study how to handle anomalies of data from sensors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
    We would like to extend our gratitude to the Swedish Research Council (under grant
    2014-4251) for the funding and the provision of resources to conduct this research.

    Abstract: As the global population soars from today''s 7.3 billion to an estimated
    10 billion by 2050, the demand for Food, Energy and Water (FEW) is expected to
    more than double. Such an increase in population and consequently, in the demand
    for FEW resources will undoubtedly be a great challenge for humankind. A challenge
    that will be exacerbated by the need for humankind to meet the greater demand
    for resources with a smaller ecological footprint. This paper is proposing a system
    developed to optimize the use of water, energy, fertilizers for agricultural crops
    as a solution to this great challenge. It is an automated smart irrigation system
    that uses real time data from wireless sensor networks to schedule an irrigation.
    The test-bed consists of a wireless network monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    solar radiation, humidity, and fertilizer sensors embedded in the root area of
    the crops and around the test-bed. Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition
    is managed by an Access Point (AP) using ZigBee protocol. An algorithm was established
    based on threshold values of temperature and soil moisture automated into a programmable
    micro-controller to control irrigation time. The system''s energy demand is completely
    supplied by a solar Photo-voltaic (PV) panel supplemented with an energy storage
    unit. The experimental data obtained from this prototype will be modeled and optimized
    to investigate food production profile as a function of energy and water consumption.
    It will also attempt to understand the effect of extreme weather conditions on
    food production. This holistic approach will explore the nexus between water and
    energy resources, and crop yield for several essential crops in an attempt to
    design a more sustainable method to meet the forecasted surge in demand. Published

    IEEE Conference Location: San Jose, CA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Currently,
    almost 70% of the global fresh water is being used for agriculture [1]. The demand
    for water is expected to increase to 55% by 2050 [2]. Similarly, 30% of total
    global energy consumption is spent on producing, transporting and distributing
    food as well as in the application of pumping, extracting, treating and transporting
    water [3], [4]. Global energy consumption is projected to increase to 80% by 2050
    [2], [4], [5]. As the demand for food soars to 60% by 2050, food security along
    with water and energy supply pose key issues in the availability, accessibility
    and utilization of these resources. Increased population growth, economic development
    and urbanization are the driving factors in the demand for food, energy and water
    resources more than ever [6]. The solution to solve the food requirement has to
    be more innovative. Fig. 1: Drivers of smart farming technology Show All Smart
    agriculture or precision farming is a recent concept that came out of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications [7]. The growing IoT landscape can almost be applied
    to different sectors and the agriculture field has been the recent one [8]. The
    combination of IoT along with predictive data analytics in agriculture can equip
    farmers with critical information on soil and environmental parameters to take
    actions. The driving factor behind smart agriculture has been the demand for more
    food production to increase yields, optimize interdependent resources of energy,
    water and land and impact of urbanization [3], [6]. With advances in technology,
    there is more push by global stakeholders like the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) for farmers to use innovative tools and digital technologies [1], [3], [5].
    The agricultural sector is faced with challenges connected to limited availability
    of arable land, water and energy, global climate change, and labor supply [6].
    The IoT framework can be used to understand the interdependency of energy, water
    and food resources through wireless sensor networks (WSN) for each sub-systems
    [9]. With realtime data, farmers can predict their yield, optimize water utilization
    through smart irrigation control and precisely know when to harvest thereby reducing
    energy and labor input. Although, smart agriculture is a recent phenomena with
    the saturation of digital technologies, there is a great body of work in IoT enabled
    farming [10]–[19]. Several works have been done in smart irrigation as part of
    smart farming model to optimize water utilization. The design and implantation
    of novel wireless mobile robot is demonstrated in [7] to monitor environmental
    parameters suitable for optimal crop yield. The use of distributed WSN of soil-moisture
    and temperature to automate irrigation system has been implemented in [10], [11].
    Remote sensing and the use of distributed WSN for a site-specific irrigation scheme
    is implemented in [12] based on soil property map. The key components in smart
    agriculture; data sensing, communications, storage and processing are integral
    in achieving robust predictive capabilities [16]. Once data has been collected,
    it has to be analyzed using different algorithms to get predictive capabilities.
    In [17] prediction models based on linear regression, neural networks and Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) are proposed from WSN data. Machine learning algorithms
    like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are often used in the data analytics to manage
    the bid data [18] side of smart farming [19]. The objective of this paper is to
    design and deploy a WSN for monitoring energy, water and crop development to further
    develop a nexus model based on real-time data. The scope of this paper is to describe
    the overall system description and deployment outlining the future proposed work.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents background work and major
    industry players in the IoT application of smart farming system. Section III describes
    the overall system design and implementation. Section IV presents the future work.
    SECTION II. Smart Farm Test Bed The smart farm test bed hereby reported consists
    of distributed WSN, off-grid PV panel, smart irrigation and data infrastructure.
    The purpose of the project is to develop an optimized smart solar-powered farm
    systems that maximize vegetation yield, minimize energy consumption, environmental
    effect through real-time monitoring from sensor data. The design requirements
    are to optimize input of fertilizers and pesticides, energy consumption using
    an off-grid PV and battery backup system and water consumption. The optimization
    function for this problem statement will be further investigated in the future
    work. The end goal is to build a circular system where energy, water, weather,
    and crop data will be collected to develop a nexus computational model. The conventional
    way of thinking about the challenges of FEW systems had focused on “peace-meal
    approach” where decisions are made in one of the nexus areas without making an
    allowance for the consequences on the other areas [6]. The nexus approach provide
    decision makers with better information through optimization of synergies and
    trade-offs. One of the objectives of the nexus is the development of modeling
    tools to support integrated decision making. Big, precise and reliable data from
    all the three systems is required to address the computational challenge for FEW
    nexus. This creates the primary reason for designing intelligent agriculture infrastructure.
    SECTION III. System Design and Implementation The design of the smart farm prototype
    included field preparation which incorporated crop-line accommodation and soil
    preparation, along with solar panel footing foundation and pole placement. The
    farm consists of three 4×25 ft raised beds as shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2: Field preparation
    Show All A. Electrical System Units The system''s energy demand is completely
    supplied by a PV panel supplemented with an energy storage unit. A 320W at peak
    power with V mpp of 37.2V PV panel with 16.3% module efficiency is used. The tilt
    angle is fixed at 26° same as the latitude of the location. The default tilt angle
    for a PV panel is set to the latitude of the location which will maximize annual
    energy production [20]. The PV panel is connected to a 20A 12V DC Maximum Power
    Point Tracking (MPPT) solar charge controller to prevent overcharging of the batteries.
    The MPPT charge controllers vary from the traditional PWM charge controller by
    allowing the solar panels to function at their optimum power output voltage thereby
    increasing their performance. The charge controller is installed between the PV
    and the batteries to automatically maintain the charge on the batteries using
    the bulk, acceptance and float charge cycles. In addition, the load for the system
    which comes mainly from the water pump is controlled by the MPPT. Two 12V, 250
    Ah are connected in series to the MPPT. Power meters with RS485 serial communication
    capability from the generation and load side are connected. They have an RS485
    serial communication capability for energy data acquisition. Energy data is acquired
    from the power meter through RS485 serial communication to Arduino and then sent
    to gateway through Zigbee protocol. Fig. 3: Electrical system unit Show All B.
    Wireless Sensor Unit WSU are equipped with different types of sensors with the
    capability of measurement, acquisition and synchronization of data. The WSU used
    for this project is an Arduino based node with various radio options for connectivity.
    It has two main component boards consisting of the sensor board and main functionality
    module board. Environmental and agriculture parameters are measured by the sensor
    board. Ambient temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, pluviometer, anemometer,
    solar radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture and leaf wetness data are collected
    every hour interval. The WSU device has been programmed to sense and transmit
    these data to a gateway router using XBee-Pro S2 module. All functionality such
    as sensing, data collection, communication and power is programmed in open source
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE). As part of the power saving mechanism,
    the micro-controller has real time clock (RTC) module that can be programmed to
    only wake the device at the time of measurement. The device is programmed to operate
    in deep sleep mode and wakes up every hour to collect and transmit sensor data.
    The device is powered by 6600 mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery. The charge
    on the battery is maintained by a 7 V-500mA solar panel for full energy autonomy.

    for irrigation scheme. Drip-irrigation is a method to water crops by dripping
    near plant roots through a network of pipes. It is the best option for irrigating
    crops by reducing water usage, improving productivity and is relatively cheaper.
    In addition, it requires low operating pressure thus reducing overall energy consumption.
    The system is fully automated that uses real time data from the WSU to schedule
    irrigation events. The control system integrates a switch regulator, 24 V DC water
    pump, 24 V DC solenoid valves, relays and Arduino. Soil moisture and temperature
    sensors are connected to the Arduino and the relays activate the solenoid valves
    and the pump at threshold value. Fig. 6: Flow chart for control system algorithm

    IV. Data Infrastructure Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition is managed
    by IoT gateway router designed to connect to the WSN. The router can work as an
    RF-XBee interface, local and external database for WSU. For this project the WSU
    sends sensor data to gateway via ZigBee protocol. The gateway automatically stores
    the data on its local storage with an additional capability to synchronize to
    an external database or connect to a cloud platform. At the time of reception
    in the router, sensor data are timestamped, parsed and stored in local or synchronized
    to an external database. Energy data infrastructure is connected similar to the
    wireless sensor nodes. The protocol uses Max485 for serial communication between
    an Arduino Mega and the power meters. Arduino sends voltage, current and power
    data in frames to router with ZigBee protocol as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION V. Future
    Work The experimental data obtained from this prototype will be modeled and optimized
    to investigate food production profile as a function of energy and water consumption.
    It will also attempt to understand the effect of extreme weather conditions on
    food production. Instead of the peace-meal approach, a holistic approach will
    be developed and explore the nexus between water and energy resources, and crop
    yield for several essential crops in an attempt to design a more sustainable method
    to meet forecasted surge in demand. The conventional way of thinking about these
    intertwined problems focus on “peace-meal approach” where decisions are made in
    one of the nexus areas of water, energy and food without making an allowance for
    the consequences on the other areas. In the future work, data collection from
    this smart farm will be crucial in analyzing the gap between the water, energy
    and crop data will be used to model the interdependency of these systems. SECTION
    VI. Conclusion The abundance of vast amount of data and the ability of analyzing
    data to make decisions have quickly become part of any sector with the advent
    of IoT technologies. Agriculture is one of the sectors with smart farming that
    relies on machine to machine communication to get precise and reliable data. This
    paper presents the design and implementation of smart farm prototype to further
    investigate and model the energy, water and food nexus in the future. In this
    paper, the overall system design, implementation and functionality is explained.
    The test-bed consists of distributed WSN that monitors different agricultural
    and environmental parameters. Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition
    is managed by IoT gateway router through ZigBee protocol. An algorithm was established
    based on threshold values of temperature and soil moisture to automated into a
    programmable micro-controller to control irrigation time. Authors Figures References

    with enhanced water conservation, using weather forecast and concept of wireless
    sensor networks. Each node consisting of soil moisture, smoke and temperature
    sensors communicates with the coordinator, using ZigBee protocol, which then sends
    updates to the farmer via SMS using GSM protocol. Hargreaves equation for reference
    evapotranspiration has been used for the determination of water requirements of
    the crop. Based upon the calculated crop evapotranspiration from the equation
    and rainfall forecast obtained from the internet, irrigation cycle of the crop
    has been modified. An experimental test bed has been developed to implement the
    proposed idea which can be easily and effectively extended to actual crop fields.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Mathura, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is the key to survival of life on this planet. Over the years, there has been
    increased stress over this essential resource, leading to its scarcity. There
    is an alarming need to develop conservation mechanisms so as to achieve effective
    and efficient use of water. One of the major requirements of water is in the field
    of agriculture for irrigational purposes. For conventional irrigation methods
    used today, the crop yield is not up to the mark in many regions. There is a need
    to develop optimum techniques for the effective water management, so as to reduce
    wastage of water as well as to enhance the crop yields. This can be done by development
    of an automated system that takes into account several factors including current
    soil moisture levels, temperature and rainfall prediction for the area, and the
    actual water requirement of crop, which can help in optimal use of water. If water
    is considered to be the lifeline of the crops, there are certain factors which
    are responsible for damaging the crop, fire being one of the major factors among
    all, ruining all the hard work of a farmer. For example, in north India, fire
    destroys hectares of crops, mainly wheat. If not taken care of in time, fire spreads
    and leads to more damage. So, if an accurate and efficient system is made to detect
    and alert the concerned about those fires, a huge amount of loss may be prevented.
    In this paper, we have presented an efficient technique for water management along
    with prevention of the fields from fire hazards, by using a network of sensors
    communicating via ZigBee protocol, Hargreaves equation and weather forecast available
    from internet. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Technical background
    is presented is Section II, the proposed solution in Section III, implementation
    in Section IV, result in Section V and conclusion in Section VI. SECTION I. Technical
    Background The present day automated irrigation systems make use of a network
    of sensors to get the data from the field [1]–[3]. The farmer receives the information
    on his mobile phone in the form of a SMS. Another method includes use of webpage
    to deliver the information to the farmer where a person can manually access the
    internet to check the data available on that webpage [4]. These kind of systems
    require a separate web server that continuously needs to keep an eye on the data
    being received [5]. Based on the different data received and its interpretation,
    the motor used for irrigation is automatically turned ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ [6]. Furthermore,
    there are separate systems that make use of sensors to detect fires in the field
    and notify the farmer about the same. A continuous monitoring by the farmer is
    required in all the previously proposed systems. Moreover, these systems are not
    able to judge the weather conditions in time and vary the irrigation scheme accordingly.
    So there is a need for a system that will collectively utilize the benefits of
    existing systems and eliminate the shortcomings, by employing weather forecast
    and Hargreaves equation as supplements. SECTION II. Proposed Solution This paper
    presents an enhanced water conservation using weather forecast, which collects
    data from a webpage about the rain prediction and then accordingly adjusts and
    delays the irrigation cycle. Consider a case when the farm is just irrigated and
    suddenly rain occurs, it is the case of water logging which can damage the crop.
    Moreover, the rain water which could have been used to irrigate the field is wasted.
    So, using the rainfall prediction can help save water to a great extent. Also,
    by using the optimum value of moisture for a particular crop in given soil, its
    yield increases, hence we calculate the water requirement of a crop (expressed
    in mm/day, mm/month or mm/season) [7]. Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for the
    water lost due to evaporation plus transpiration through plants. The crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for different crops is calculated as the ratio crop evapotranspiration
    to reference crop evapotranspiration. ET c (crop evapotranspiration) is calculated
    from climatic data by directly integrating the effect of crop characteristics
    into ET0 as given in the following equation [8]: E T c =E T ∗ 0 K c (1) View Source
    Where, ET c = Crop evapotranspiration (mm/day); ET 0 = Reference crop evapotranspiration
    (mm/day); K c = Crop coefficient. Several methods have been developed to calculate
    the value of ET 0 [9]. In our system, we have used a temperature-based method
    given by the Hargreaves-Samani equation expressed as [10]: E T 0 = 0.0023 ∗ (
    T mean +17.8)∗( T max − T min ) 0.5 ∗ R a (2) View Source Where, ET 0 = reference
    grass evapotranspiration (mm per day); where T max = daily maximum temperature
    (°C); T min = daily minimum temperature (°C); T mean = average daily temperature,
    T mean =( T min + T max )/2; R a = extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m-2 day-l) [10].
    The values of ET c and CWR (Crop Water Requirements) are identical, whereby ET
    c refers to the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration and CWR is the
    amount of water that has to be provided to compensate the loss [11]. Thus, we
    can find out the value of threshold moisture level of soil and adjust the water
    given to field accordingly for a particular crop [12]. In case of fire, the sprinkler
    system is activated which controls the fire to a certain extent and notifies the
    farmer and the fire department about the same. The microcontroller receives analog
    input from the sensors installed in the field. Three type of sensors have been
    used, namely, soil moisture sensor for detecting the moisture content present
    in the soil, temperature sensor for determining the temperature in the field,
    and smoke sensor to detect concentration of smoke in the air. A large number of
    nodes comprising the sensors are installed at suitable locations in the field
    which send the collected information to the coordinator node using ZigBee protocol
    [13]. The coordinator unit interprets the data received from the sensors and accordingly
    performs the required action (see Fig. 1, and Fig. 2,). When the soil moisture
    content is below the threshold value, the motors are automatically turned on and
    SMS is sent to the farmer using GSM module, informing about the same. Similarly,
    the smoke sensor detects the raised levels of smoke in the air and microcontroller
    activates the sprinkler actuator, sending SMS to the farmer. Furthermore, Internet
    is used to access the website for weather forecast, the rainfall prediction is
    read and if there is high probability of raining the next day, the crops are not
    irrigated that day. In this way, water can be conserved through efficient use
    of rainwater and water logging is also prevented. SECTION III. Implementation
    A. Hardware Implementation 1) Microcontroller Unit The use of Arduino Mega 2560
    [14] is employed to intercept the data from the sensors and then act accordingly.
    It mainly consists of 54 digital input/output pins, 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs,
    USB slot etc. The advantage of using Arduino is that it is open source, easy to
    program and there are many compatible accessories available in market like Arduino
    shields for various modules. It is a low power microcontroller having a very high
    number of I/O pins making it easy to interface a large number of sensors at a
    time. The processing speed is also very high (16MHz). Fig. 1: Central coordinator
    system Show All Fig. 2: Block diagram of central unit Show All 2) Inputs The inputs
    are in the form of analog values coming from the sensors. The remote transmitter
    unit that provides the inputs. The system and block diagram is shown in Fig. 3,
    and Fig. 4, respectively. Three sensors have been used in the system. Moisture
    Sensor It senses the moisture level in the soil which gives analog values as the
    output according to the change in the conductivity of the soil as the moisture
    content varies. This data is sent to the controller which compares it with the
    threshold value as defined for the crop and the soil. This data is used turn on
    or off the motor for irrigating the field. Smoke Sensor (MQ-2) This sensor has
    good sensitivity to smoke or combustible gases present in air. It is highly sensitive
    to LPG, hydrogen and propane. When a gas interacts with the sensor, firstly it
    gets ionized into its constituents and then absorbed by sensor, creating a potential
    difference. The analog voltage output is fed to the controller and is compared
    with the preset threshold for generating an alert signal. Temperature Sensor Temperature
    sensor LM35 has an output voltage that is directly dependent on the temperature
    of the environment it is exposed to. The scale factor is of value 1mV/C. It draws
    only 60 micro amperes from its supply and has very low self-heating. Its operating
    range is −55°C to 150°C. The temperature data is sent to the farmer by piggybacking
    on the data related to status of motor and sprinkler. Ethernet Shield The Ethernet
    shield [15] is used for the connection of the Arduino with the Internet using
    NTP protocol and the yahoo weather site is accessed with the help of temboo library
    of Arduino. The data related to the weather forecast of next three days is extracted
    from the html form of the webpage. XBee XB24-Z7WIT-0004 Module XBee XB24-Z7WIT−
    004 Digi. Series 2 module creates a wireless network using ZigBee protocol. These
    provide an indoor/urban range up to 133 ft. (40m) and an outdoor RF line-of-sight
    range up to 400 ft. (120m). It is used to connect various nodes to the Central
    coordinator wirelessly. Fig. 3: Remote transmitter unit (end device) Show All
    Fig. 4: Block diagram of remote transmitter node Show All 3) Outputs The outputs
    of the controller are fed to the relays which control the working of motors used
    for water pumps and the sprinklers. The farmer is notified by sending an SMS,
    as shown in Fig. 5, regarding the status of motor, weather, temperature of soil
    every 6 hours using GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) module SIM900A
    [16] so that he can also monitor the system and his farm with the system working
    on the algorithm shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 5: Screenshots of SMS alerts received by
    the farmer Show All Fig. 6: Flow chart of algorithm for outputs Show All A. Software
    Implementation Following development environments were used to program and configure
    the hardware. 1) Arduino IDE-1.6.5 The open source Arduino ide which has high
    abstraction level using C++ language is used to program the Development board
    Arduin o mega 2560 [14]. 2) X-CTU 6.1 XCTU is a free multi-platform application
    that enables the Developers to interact with Digi RF modules through a simple-to-use
    graphical interface. This software is used to configure the X-bee modules as coordinator,
    router and end devices. The configuration setting includes the transmission mode,
    security keys, type of encryption etc. SECTION IV. Results Thus, according to
    the soil moisture level and rainfall prediction the motor is controlled as shown
    in Table I. When the sensors sense smoke levels greater than the threshold, i.e.
    an indication of fire accident, the sprinklers are turned ON until the value drops
    below the threshold value (see Table II). The graph for voltage values from soil
    moisture sensor against the water supplied, as obtained in Table III is plotted
    in Fig. 7. Fig. 7: Plot for voltage values (v) obtained by soil moisture sensor
    for different amount of water supplied (mm) Show All Table 1: Moisture value,
    rainfall and motor status Table 2: Smoke, temperature and sprinklers status Table
    3: Voltage values (v) obtained by soil moisture sensor for different water supplied
    values (mm) If the value is less than the calculated crop water requirements,
    the prediction of rain for the next day is checked using Arduino Ethernet shield.
    If prediction of rain is negative, the motor is turned ON until the value of soil
    moisture reaches the desired value. On the contrary, if the prediction of rain
    is positive, we need not supply water to the fields as shown in Table 1. All this
    information is sent to farmer''s cell phone using GSM module. Therefore, the proposed
    system is effectively determining the water requirements for the crop by knowing
    the information of the crop, and season provided by the farmer, and through the
    network of sensors installed in the field. The information about temperature and
    weather of the region was read from the internet and used to further optimize
    the irrigation system. Depending upon the required moisture level, the field was
    watered as and when required. The system would work out to be very efficient for
    optimum use of available water resources, reduction in irrigation costs as well
    as to ensure the crop receives appropriate amount of water for its proper growth.
    SECTION V. Conclusion Our proposed system successfully provides an appropriate
    amount of water for the selected crop and soil combinations, thereby reducing
    wastage of water resource as well as resulting in better yields for the crop.
    In addition, chances of rainfall gathered from a weather forecasting were also
    taken into account so as to prevent over irrigation of the crop and make use of
    rainwater. The fire accidents are also prevented by early detection and quick
    prevention measures. Moreover, all the information about what is going on in the
    field has been continuously sent through SMS on farmer''s mobile phone. This reduces
    human intervention and also the labour cost. The proposed solution is highly efficient
    in terms of performance installation and operational cost. The system does not
    require any special training and can be used by anyone easily. Authors Figures

    lands plays a crucial role in water and soil conservation. Real-time prediction
    of soil moisture content using wireless sensor network (WSN) based soil and environmental
    parameters sensing may provide an efficient platform to meet the irrigation requirement

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Irrigation is a crucial practice in several
    agricultural cropping systems in semiarid and arid areas, and also useful water
    applications and management are key concerns. The efficiency and uniformity of
    irrigation could be maintained from the complex and diverse information based
    systems by considering weather, soil, water, and crop data. Irrigation water management
    forms a major part of precision agriculture. It involves better assessment of
    need and availability of soil water level for crop cultivation. The statistical
    data from the United Nations indicate worldwide, agricultural accounts for 70
    % of all water consumption, compared to 20 % for industry and 10 % for domestic
    use [1]. There are models developed that use the remotely sensed data to profile
    the soil moisture. However, remote sensing can be used to directly infer soil
    moisture. Microwave emissivities and infrared data were proven to be highly correlated
    with the soil moisture [2]. A lot of research has been concentrated in this area
    during the last two decades. Recently many researchers have been reported for
    soil moisture level control in an agriculture land by collecting soil and environmental
    information using wireless sensor network technique. Liang et al. [3] have proposed
    a design and implement of a real-time soil moisture prediction system based on
    GPRS and wireless sensor network. The front-end of the system utilizes wireless
    sensor network (WSN) environment to collect soil moisture data and a GPRS network
    to transmit the acquired data. The back-end of the system utilizes genetic backpropagation
    neural network to analyze and process the acquired data, simulate using annealing
    algorithm to optimum result, and to gives a real-time prediction output. The experimental
    results concludes that this system has the major advantages like low cost, high
    degree of accuracy and convenient maintenance [3]. The method proposed by Liang
    et al. [3] is a direct sensing of soil moisture content using WSN environment
    but the proposed method does not emphasizes on the irrigation mechanism. In the
    similar context, the other land related parameters and environmental parameters
    may affect the irrigation requirements. Timely prediction of soil moisture content
    will provide better irrigation management in a land by considering almost all
    the required parameters which affects the soil water evaporation. This prediction
    requires efficient algorithms which will produce future irrigation requirements
    in an agriculture land. The algorithm is tested for the prediction of soil moisture
    content in 1 h advance by considering eleven different soil and environmental
    parameters. The performance of Resilient Back-propagation is compared using MSE
    (Mean Square Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and R-squared error. In the
    similar context, Goumopoulos et al. [4] describe the design of an adaptable decision
    support system and its integration with a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN)
    to implement autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation. Using ontology for
    defining the application logic emphasizes system flexibility and adaptability
    and supports the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms.
    Furthermore, a machine learning process has been applied for inducing new rules
    by analyzing logged datasets for extracting new knowledge and extending the system
    ontology in order to cope, for example, with a sensor type failure or to improve
    the accuracy of a plant state diagnosis. A deployment of the system is presented
    in zone specific irrigation control in a greenhouse setting. The method proposed
    by Goumopoulos et al. [4], consider only on the soil moisture content data from
    a greenhouse environment. This technique does not include other soil and environmental
    data like soil temperature, environmental humidity, environmental temperature
    and sun light intensity which are most required parameters for soil evapotranspiration.
    The timely prediction of soil moisture content is also not included in the method
    proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [4]. Our proposed method emphasises on the timely
    prediction of soil moisture content in any farming area like a greenhouse, polyhouse
    and large farmland by considering different soil and environmental parameters.

    Full size table 2 Proposed Methodology Agriculture system models are complex nonlinear
    systems which can be solved using powerful estimation methodologies like neural
    network algorithms [6]. In this work neural network pattern classification technique
    is proposed for the prediction of soil moisture content by considering soil and
    environmental parameters. A feedforward neural network is trained using Resilient
    Back-propagation (Rprop) which update weight and bias values. In the similar context,
    Chai et al. [5] have proposed Resilient Back-propagation (Rprop) for the prediction
    of soil moisture content during a field test during National Airborne Field Experiment
    2005 (NAFE’05). According to the experiment, the RMSE obtained is about 4.93 %v/v
    [5]. In our proposed technique, the collection of soil and environmental data
    is performed using wireless sensor network (WSN) environment for the real-time
    monitoring and analysis of soil moisture content (MC) of the test site located
    in the eastern region of India. The test site of (50 m × 100 m) is planted with
    bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) which is used for stomach ulcer, colitis, and
    stomach infections as ayurvedic medicine. The test site contains nine WSN nodes
    with nine individual irrigation valves. The WSN nodes are used to collect data
    from soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor, environmental temperature
    sensor, environmental humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, and sun light intensity sensor
    for multi-point measurement of land data in agricultural production. The proposed
    single node fabricated during this work is shown in Fig. 1a. The collected data
    were stored in a gateway node consisting of Raspberry Pi, Zigbee series 2 and
    wifi connectivity as shown in Fig. 1b. The proposed data collection architecture
    is shown in Fig. 1c. The complete scheme is utilized to collect twenty four numbers
    of data sets consisting of all the above mentioned parameters. These twenty four
    numbers of datasets signifies the collection of all the data in 24 h in a day.

    is an efficient learning approach for supervised learning mechanism in feedforward
    artificial neural networks architectures [7–9]. It is a first order optimization
    technique. This technique is also an efficient new learning scheme focusing on
    a direct adaptation of the weight steps depending on local gradient information.
    To achieve this, individual update-value \(\Delta _{\text{ij}}\) is introduced
    for each weight, which solely determines the size of the weight-update [10–12].
    This adaptive update-value evolves during the learning process based on its local

    about to be crisp and settled which are actually not deterministic at all [13].
    If the shape of uncertainty exists to arise as a result of impreciseness, ambiguity,
    or unclearness, then the variable may be fuzzy and portrayed by a membership operate.
    Defuzzification is that the conversion of a fuzzy amount to an explicit quantity,
    just as fuzzification is the conversion of an explicit amount to a fuzzy quantity.
    In this work, the fuzzy membership functions are considered as sunlight intensity,
    wind speed, environmental humidity, environmental temperature and predicted soil
    moisture content which was obtained using neural network pattern classification.
    The membership function selected for the fuzzy weather model is a triangular shape
    function. The fuzzy logic input and output membership functions are listed in
    Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. 3 Results and Discussions The overall performance
    of the optimization techniques for the prediction of soil moisture content is
    examined by considering eleven soil and environmental parameters. The input and
    output data are listed in Table 2. The predicted soil moisture content for 1 h
    advance is compared with ideal moisture content using time, MSE (Mean Square Error),
    RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and R-squared error during ideal weather condition.

    soil MC is supplied to fuzzy logic weather model for generating appropriate irrigation
    suggestions. The fuzzy logic input and output membership fuctions are shown in

    model is tested with different test inputs and it is observed that the neural
    network and fuzzy logic algorithms are performing well good. Some of the test
    conditions are listed in Table 4. Table 4 Test inputs and outputs of the proposed
    irrigation model Full size table 4 Conclusion The soil moisture content in 1 h
    advance is efficiently predicted by taking various soil and environmental parameters.
    The performance analysis of Resilient Back-propagation optimization technique
    for neural network pattern classification is done by calculating MSE, RMSE and
    R-squared error. From the errors obtained during prediction shows that the performance
    of Resilient Back-propagation based neural network pattern classification gives
    better result in soil moisture content prediction. The MSE and RMSE obtained by
    Resilient Back-propagation based neural network pattern classification are 6.5198e-05
    and 0.008074. The predicted soil moisture content is successfully used in the
    fuzzy logic weather model for generating adequate irrigation suggestions. Hence
    it concluded that the proposed weather condition dependent hybrid irrigation model
    will help to predict soil MC and to generate necessary irrigation suggestions
    using real-time sensor data from the agriculture locations. The complete work
    is successfully tested in the test land (Latitude: 20.351323, Longitude: 85.806547).
    The proposed model needs more rigorous multiple farm testing to obtain complete
    performance of the soil moisture control mechanism. References Worldometers about

    based on the concept of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The goal of this application
    is to enable, through the measurement of relevant parameters, the constant evaluation
    of the state of the grass in the different zones of a golf course. The environmental
    monitoring systems currently installed on most golf courses uses a single weather
    station. This weather station only gives general data about the weather conditions
    of the region where the course is located and doesn''t allow green keepers to
    distinguish the irrigation needs of the different zones of a golf course. By continuously
    monitoring the soil condition in real time on all the zones of a golf course it
    is possible to obtain a more detailed vision of the grass water needs and of the
    hydrological behaviour of each soil, thus improving irrigation efficiency. Published

    Conference Location: Cairo, Egypt SECTION I. Introduction The technological developments
    on the fields of microelectronics and wireless communications allowed the creation
    of a new type of devices called sensing nodes (some times also referred to as
    motes). Each of these sensing nodes generally consists of a microprocessor, memory,
    sensors and/or actuators and a wireless transceiver that allows it to communicate
    with other similar nodes forming an intelligent wireless network (WSN), as described
    in [1]. There are many areas were the concept of WSN is being applied. From the
    monitoring of buildings and structures to the scientific study of natural events
    like seismic activity or the behavior of ecosystems, every phenomenon that might
    be useful to supervise can be monitored using a WSN. The use of WSNs offers advantages
    over traditional monitoring systems: lower installation and maintenance costs,
    greater flexibility and the possibility of mobility. These advantages can help
    make the traditional monitoring applications more efficient or even create opportunities
    for the creation of entirely new applications. The monitoring of environmental
    parameters as a support for the agricultural management is one of the areas where
    de concept of WSN can be applied with more success. The worldwide problem of agricultural
    sustainability makes the adoption of solutions that help increase productivity
    mandatory. The concept of “precision agriculture” appeared with the aim to optimize
    agricultural productivity by increasing crop production and/or lowering its costs.
    To meet this objective it is essential to manage irrigation in order to maximize
    its efficiency. Because water is an increasingly scarce resource, and agriculture
    is its biggest consumer, irrigation management is gaining importance as a means
    to minimize the environmental impact of agricultural productions. Perhaps the
    most controversial use of water is in the irrigation of golf courses where millions
    of liters are spent regularly across the planet. To make things even worse, a
    significant part of the golf courses have been, or are being built in touristic
    areas, some with limited hydrologic capacity, and where water is, often, a precious
    resource. The great importance of tourism on countries economies is driving the
    development of efficient ways for maintaining golf courses operating in a sustainable
    manner and in harmony with the surrounding environment. In this context the optimization
    of water consumption on golf courses will be of vital importance. The objective
    of this project is to create an environmental monitoring solution based on the
    concept of WSN that can be used as an aid to the irrigation management of a golf
    course. The characteristics of a golf course, where specialists do all the irrigation
    management, make this an ideal place to develop and test solutions of this type.
    Besides, the economic capacity of these sports fields may cause them to be early
    adopters of this technology. A solution for monitoring environmental parameters
    using WSNs that can operate successfully on a golf course may be adapted later
    to other types of agricultural crops. SECTION II. Related Work There are several
    projects in the area of environmental monitoring that make use of WSNs to aid
    on the management of crops or that are used for strictly scientific purposes.
    The specific objectives of each project determine which parameters should be monitored.
    The most common measured parameters are moisture, air temperature, atmospheric
    pressure, soil moisture, soil temperature, brightness and seismic vibrations.
    The general WSN architecture used in these projects is represent on Figure 1.
    The remote nodes are installed in the areas where the parameters should be monitored.
    The number of nodes, the density with which they are installed and the WSN topology
    to be used (e.g. star, tree, mesh, single-hop, multi-hop) depend on the application
    requirements. Each remote node can control one or more sensors that can measure
    various parameters or the same parameter in different areas or at different depths.
    As can be seen in Figure 1, the communication between remote nodes and between
    these nodes and the sink is always performed using wireless communication protocols.
    The type of communication used between the sink nodes and the final processing
    node depends on the characteristics of each project and can be done using cables
    or a wide-range wireless technology (e.g. GPRS or 802.11).. Fig.1 Generic WSN
    Architecture Show All The project Vineyard Computing [2] uses mobile nodes that
    collect information stored on the remote nodes installed in vineyards and transports
    this information to the final processing system located at the farms headquarters.
    The mobile nodes can be installed in different objects, people or animals that
    usually make journeys between the wine regions where data is collected and the
    location of the final processing system. This type of configuration has the advantage
    of allowing a more spaced installation of the nodes at the vine because there
    is no need for neighbor nodes to communicate. The fact that the remote static
    nodes have to be with their radios on, permanently (listening to the channel),
    in order to detect the passage of mobile nodes is a disadvantage of this type
    of architecture which as consequences in terms of the energy consumption of each
    node. The project Life Under your Feet [3], consists in the application of a WSN
    to the study of soil ecology. It is designed to understand the effects of environmental
    conditions in the soil ecosystem. It consists of a data collection subsystem (motes
    + base station) and a database. Each mote is connected to four sensors. The acquisition
    board from Crossbow (MTS 101) includes ambient light and temperature sensors and
    ports to connect external sensors. To these ports are connected a soil moisture
    sensor and a soil temperature sensor. The data collected by the sensors is supplemented
    with information obtained from external sources such as online repositories in
    CSV format. This information includes temperature, precipitation, humidity, atmospheric
    pressure and weather events (e.g. rain, snow, lightning). Data collected in this
    project is used by biologists to predict where and when microbial or soil invertebrate
    organisms activity will occur. This activity is closely related to the process
    of soil respiration, which is an important, but little- studied component of the
    carbon cycle. The continuous monitoring of the soil ecosystem will help to understand
    the contribution of these processes in the large-scale carbon cycle. The project
    Wireless Sensor Network for Variable Rate Irrigation in Citrus [4] uses a network
    of sensors and actuators to irrigate citrus plantations in the Brazilian state
    of Sao Paulo. This state has one of the largest citrus production areas in the
    world. Currently most of this area has no irrigation system, but climate change
    and the emergence of new diseases will require a change of scenery. The scarce
    water resources of the region make it essential to develop and implement methods
    of water conservation. The proposed system uses a network of fixed sensors and
    actuators that communicate through wireless connections to manage the whole process
    of irrigation. The remote nodes use capacitive sensors to measure soil moisture,
    while the actuators are connected to electro-valves that allow the control of
    the irrigation system. Each Field Station, featuring a CPU, a mini weather station,
    an 802.11b WLAN interface, and a proprietary communications, has a coverage of
    about 100 hectares, which means it can control 400 remote nodes separated by a
    distance of 50 meters. Two 55Ah batteries recharged by a 70 watts photovoltaic
    solar panel power all these devices. The project PermaSense [5], uses a WSN to
    measure physical parameters of frozen soil in order to understand their behavior
    during climatic changes. Permafrost is defined as soil that remains at temperatures
    below 0° throughout the year. Its occurrence is common in colder regions of the
    planet (near to the poles or at high altitudes). Global warming has led to some
    areas formed by this type of soil to reach higher temperatures than usual. In
    mountainous areas, such as the Swiss Alps, the temperature rise makes the soil
    less consistent and thus can cause the release of rocky material causing damage
    to infrastructures such as hotels, roads or railway lines. One or several GSM/GPRS
    nodes are used to connect the WSN to the Internet. Each remote node measures in
    “almost” real time four temperatures and four conductivities, which allow accessing
    the moisture content and physical condition of the soil. A multi-hop topology
    to route data to the node that contains the GPRS module is used. SECTION III.
    Design and Implementation • A. Requirements and Goals The first step in identifying
    the requirements that this project should meet was to study the operation of a
    real golf course and its irrigation system. The golf course Oeiras Golf & Residence
    served as a case study for this purpose. A brief description of how the irrigation
    system of a typical golf course works and what are the mechanisms used to adjust
    the amount of water used in its irrigation follows. Afterwards the functional
    requirements identified are listed. 1) Current Situation The irrigation system
    of the studied golf course consists of four components: water pumps, control satellites,
    sprinklers and pipes. The water pumps are used to extract ground water and to
    give pressure to the irrigation system. The control satellites are small base
    stations installed throughout the golf course that allow controlling the operation
    of the sprinklers. In the studied course there are 15 satellites - about one per
    green. It''s possible to control how long each zone of the golf course remains
    in irrigation through these satellites. The control satellites are constantly
    fed with 220V AC while 24V DC power the sprinklers only when they are on. The
    person responsible for the maintenance of the grass, referred to as a greenkeeper,
    relies only on the data provided by a weather station and on its own experience
    to adjust the amount of water used on the irrigation of the course. 1) Functional
    Requirements The system needs to measure several parameters at regular intervals.
    These parameters are: soil moisture at different depths, temperature at the ground
    level and the voltage of the batteries that power the remote nodes. Then it needs
    to transmit the data collected by the remote nodes to the final processing node
    at regular intervals. The energy consumption of the remote nodes must be optimized.
    Finally the installed equipment should not interfere with the practice of the
    game or the aesthetics of the golf course. B. System Architecture The general
    architecture of the monitoring system proposed in this project is represented
    in Figure 2. The WSN is divided into cells in order to adapt the network architecture
    to the geographical distribution of the sites that must be monitored. Each of
    these cells is composed of four remote sensing nodes. Three of which must be installed
    on the green (the most relevant place to monitor) while a fourth node should be
    used to monitor the area of the fairway. Each of these remote sensing nodes consists
    of a MicaZ mote, a sensory board, shown in Figure 3, and soil moisture sensors.
    Each of these components is described in further detail on the next section. Fig.2
    System Architecture of the proposed solution Show All All cells also have a sink
    node ensuring communication between remote nodes and the final processing node
    (FPN). The FPN gathers all the information collected by the WSN providing it to
    the end user, which may be a human or an application that uses the data collected
    to directly control the irrigation system. 1) System Components • MicaZ MoteThe
    MicaZ mote from Crossbow [6] is a module composed of an AVR 8-bit Atmel ATMEGA128
    microcontroller and an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceiver operating in the 2.4GHz
    frequency: the Chipconn CC2420. This mote has a 51-pin Hirose connector that allows
    the connection of different types of sensor boards. These boards can have passive
    sensors that are measured directly using the ADC ports of the ATMEGA128 processor
    or they can have their own microprocessor that communicates with the MicaZ mote
    using SPI or I2C. • Sensor Board with Co-ProcessorA sensor board, which connects
    to the MicaZ mote through the 51-pin Hirose, was specially developed for this
    project. This board uses a PIC24FJ64GA002 processor to control the operation of
    a set of sensors, perform calculations and communicate with the mote MicaZ ATMEGA128
    processor. The developed board is shown on Figure 3. Fig.3 Developed Sensor Board
    with Co-Processor Show All The PIC microprocessor has a set of ADCs that allow
    it to be used to read analog sensors. It uses three types of sensors in order
    to measure soil moisture, temperature and the voltage of the batteries that power
    the remote node. The EC-5 soil moisture sensors, described in more detail on the
    following section, can be connected to this board using three-pin connectors,
    on the top right of Figure 3. The temperature sensor chosen was the AD22103 from
    Analog Devices. This sensor was considered to be a good compromise between accuracy
    (maximum error 2.5%) and price. Its small size (SOIC-8 package with about 19mm2
    of area) was also essential to produce a sensor board with the same dimensions
    as the MicaZ mote. In order to determine the voltage of the batteries that power
    the remote node a reference voltage had to be added to the sensor board. The reference
    voltage chosen was the LM4140CCM from National Semiconductor. This model can receive
    an input voltage between 1.8 V and 5.5 V and has a fixed output voltage of 1.024V.
    Because the voltage of the batteries that power the remote node is used by the
    PIC as the maximum value in the conversion of analog to digital values it is possible
    to calculate its value using one of these ADCs to measure a voltage previously
    known. The reference voltage LM4140CCM provides a precise known voltage. • Soil
    Moisture SensorsFig. 5. Final Processing Node Activity Diagram For the soil moisture
    sensors we use a sensor form Decagon, the EC-5 (described and tested in [7]) is
    represented in Figure 4. These capacitive sensors use the soil as part of the
    dielectric of a capacitor. In a soil with a large percentage of water the capacitor
    will charge more slowly and therefore the load curve is more linear than in a
    soil with a low percentage of water. This implies that on a wet ground the capacitor
    will reach a certain threshold voltage (Vt) later than in dry soil. Fig.4 EC-5
    Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor Show All The output voltage of the sensor is directly
    related to the average voltage during the period t. Thus a soil with high water
    content will result in a higher output voltage while a soil with low water content
    will result in a low output voltage. • C. Measurement and Actuation Algorithm
    In order to obtain the data collected by the WSN and control its operation a distributed
    measurement and actuation algorithm was developed and implemented. The development
    of this algorithm aimed to answer the following 5 fundamental requirements: Measure
    soil moisture, temperature and battery voltage at regular intervals. Send the
    measurements collected by the WSN to the final processing node at regular intervals.
    Allow the user of the system to control the state (Irrigation Mode or Normal Mode)
    in which each node is at a given time. Allow the user to configure in run-time
    the following configuration parameters of the WSN: the frequency with which the
    data collected by the WSN is sent to the final processing node and the number
    of samples collected in each period. Reduce the time that the remote nodes have
    to stay with their radios turned on to a minimum. This is a distributed algorithm
    that runs on the following three platforms: Sensor board with co-processor. MicaZ
    mote from Crossbow with an Atmega128 processor. Final Processing Node (PC) The
    activity diagram of the GolfSense application that runs on the final processing
    node is represented in Figure 5. When this application receives a packet with
    measurements from a remote node of the WSN it sends the received data to the GolfWater
    application and writes that data to a locally stored file. Then it checks if there
    is a pending irrigation order for the remote node that sent the packet of measurements.
    If there is no pending order, a packet containing only the configuration parameters
    of the WSN is sent to the remote node. If, on the contrary, there is a pending
    irrigation order, the start and stop times of the irrigation period are calculated
    and sent to the remote node. Finally, it is sent to the remote node a packet containing
    the configuration parameters of the WSN and the irrigation order. Fig.5 Final
    Processing Node Activity Diagram Show All An activity diagram that contains the
    set of events that occur on the remote node (MicaZ) when the synchronization timer
    is triggered is represented on Figure 6. In this case, the first action taken
    by the program that runs on the remote node is to obtain the average of the parameters
    (soil moisture, temperature and battery voltage) calculated by the aforementioned
    sensor board. This transfer of information between the sensor board and the MicaZ
    mote is performed using the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol. After obtaining
    this information the remote node activates its radio interface and sends the data
    collected to the FPN. After this, the remote node listens to the channel until
    it receives a message from the FPN or a time-out occurs. If the remote node receives
    a message from the FPN the message is analyzed to see if there was any change
    in the settings of the WSN or if there is a new irrigation order. In the end the
    MicaZ radio interface is turned off again. Through this mechanism the radio interface
    is turned on only for a short period during which the remote node sends the data
    collected to the FPN and waits (a limited time) for a configuration message from
    that node. Some latency is thus introduced in the control system of the WSN as
    the FPN can only send to the remote node configuration messages during the period
    following the sending of a data message from the remote node to the FPN. Allowing
    the remote nodes to keep their radio interfaces off during most of the time and
    thus saving energy offsets this latency. Fig.6 Remote Node (MicaZ) Activity Diagram
    Show All The events described in Figure 6 are triggered by the synchronization
    timer that runs periodically with a period equal to the “synchronization period
    in Normal mode” or to the “synchronization period in Irrigation Mode” depending
    on the state of the remote node. There are two timers that control the state in
    which the remote node is (begin_irrigation_timer and end_irrigation_timer) that
    are created when a new irrigation order arrives to the remote node. When the begin_irrigation_timer
    is triggered the synchronization period is changed to the irrigation mode period
    and the MicaZ mote sends to the sensor board (using I2C) a new measurement period.
    When the end_irrigation_timer is triggered the synchronization period is reset
    to the “synchronization period in Normal mode” and the sensor board is once again
    informed of the new measurement period. The program that runs on the PIC of the
    sensor board has the following functions: i) receive from the MicaZ mote the measurement
    period; ii) take measurements (soil moisture, temperature and battery voltage)
    using a set of ADCs; iii) perform the calculations necessary to transform the
    measures of the ADCs in the actual values of voltage, temperature and soil moisture;
    iv) add the calculated values to a table of averages that is periodically reed
    (and reset) by the MicaZ mote using I2C. SECTION IV. Tests and Results This section
    describes several tests that validate the proper functioning of the developed
    features and evaluates the performance of the system. Three MicaZ motes that have
    been connected to sensor boards were used. To accomplish communication between
    the remote nodes and the FPN a MIB600 that communicates with the MicaZ motes through
    802.15.4 and the FPN through an Ethernet cable was used. The FPN is a common off-the-shelf
    PC running a Linux OS. It was on this test bed, installed in the courtyards of
    the Instituto Superior Tecnico - Taguspark, that the tests described below were
    performed. • A. Measure of Soil Moisture during irrigation periods The purpose
    of this first test was to determine the capacity that the system has to accurately
    measure soil moisture at various depths and transmit the measured values to a
    FPN. The aim was also to check that the system was able, through the measurements
    performed by the soil moisture sensors, to quickly detect the beginning (and end)
    of rain or irrigation periods. On this test the system performed soil moisture
    measurements before, during, and after periods of irrigation. The total duration
    of the test was of about four hours during which the irrigation system was activated
    three times. The first time the irrigation system was turned on was between minute
    25 and minute 35 of the test. Later the system was activated for two minutes more,
    between minutes 39 and 41 and again for another 10 minutes, between minutes 42
    and 52. After this last irrigation period the system continued to carry out measurements
    for approximately 170 minutes. These constant changes between watering times and
    periods during which the system was disabled, had the purpose to evaluate the
    system''s ability to detect periods of irrigation (or rain). The system was configured
    to send the data collected with the frequency of 1 minute during which 4 soil
    moisture measurements should be collected. The values of soil moisture measured
    by the 3 sensors placed at 3 different depths are showed on Figure 7. sensor 1
    was located at a depth of 2 cm, sensor 2 at a depth of 5 cm and sensor 3 at a
    depth of 10 cm. The blue vertical bars represent the periods during which the
    irrigation was turned on. Fig.7 Soil moisture variation at 3 different depths
    Show All By observing this graph we can conclude that this monitoring system is
    effective to detect watering times since about 1 minute after the irrigation system
    has been activated there was a sharp increase in the values of soil moisture measured
    by sensor 1. As expected, the soil moisture measured by sensors 2 and 3 only began
    to increase after a few minutes due to the time it takes for water to seep into
    the soil and reach the depth at which these sensors were. It is also possible
    to conclude that the two sensors that are closer to the surface are much more
    sensitive to the fact that the irrigation is active or not than sensor 3, which
    is at a greater depth. In fact, the measurements made by the two sensors that
    are closest to the surface almost immediately reflect the change of the state
    in which the irrigation system is (active or inactive). It is also interesting
    to compare the values of soil moisture reported by the 3 sensors at the beginning
    and at the end of this test. Both times the sensor that measures higher soil moisture
    is the one that is installed deeper, followed by the one that is in the middle
    and finally the sensor closest to the surface is the one that reports the lowest
    soil moisture. This can be explained by the fact that the surface soils retain
    less water due to evaporation and infiltration effects. • C. Long Term Test on
    an Outdoor Garden The test described in this section was intended to evaluate
    the behavior of the developed system in an environment as close to the reality
    for which it was designed as possible. In order to test the system''s behavior
    in an outdoor environment deployment similar to the one used in the previous test
    was done on an outdoor garden. The soil moisture sensors were placed at a depth
    of 3 cm. Each remote node was installed in a location with specific characteristics
    in order to determine how these characteristics influence the measurements taken.
    Follows a description of each location where the remote nodes were installed:
    Location 1: Near the irrigation system sprinkler in a flat area. Location 2: Near
    the irrigation system sprinkler in a flat area under the influence (shadow) of
    a tree. Location 3: At the edge of the sprinkler range in a sloping area. Each
    day an irrigation period with an extent of 5 minutes beginning at 17:30 was defined.
    The chart of Figure 8 shows the temperatures and soil moistures measured by the
    3 remote nodes during 3 days. The blue vertical bars show the periods during which
    the irrigation system was turned on. As shown on this chart, during the nights
    the measured temperatures were quite low (around 12.7°) while during the day the
    temperature achieved values of around 46.1°. Another interesting information is
    that the temperature of remote node 2 never reaches values as high as those measured
    by the other nodes. The maximum temperature measured by remote node 2 was of 36.7°.
    This behavior can be explained by the fact that remote node 2 was installed near
    a tree which caused it to be in the shade during the hottest periods. As it was
    expected, the rate at which soil moisture decreases after an irrigation period
    is directly related to the temperature measured at the time. Looking at the chart
    of Figure 8 it can be concluded that the higher the temperature the faster the
    soil moisture decreases. During the night periods, when the temperature was lower
    and the air moisture was presumably higher, the soil moisture hardly diminished
    and even increased slightly on the 3rd day probably due to the infiltration of
    water from the irrigation. since the irrigation periods should ideally be performed
    at a time when the area to be irrigated is no longer under direct sunlight exposure,
    the temperature information collected by the system can be very useful in determining
    when to irrigate each zone. Fig.8 Temperature (°C) and Soil Moisture (%) Variation.
    Show All SECTION V. Conclusions The work proposed in this paper sought to apply
    the concept of WSNs to the monitoring of environmental parameters in order to
    optimize agricultural productivity and thus be beneficial from an economic point
    of view. The development of a reference implementation, based on a more general
    conception of an application for environmental monitoring, allowed validating
    the concept by putting it to the test in real scenarios. The set of tests made
    on this prototype leads to the conclusion that it is effective in measuring both
    soil moisture and temperature, and that these measurements can be very useful
    to aid in the irrigation management. The periods of irrigation (or rain) are quickly
    detected by the monitoring system and the temperature gradients measured are extremely
    useful to determine the best times to irrigate each area of a golf course. Also,
    the measurement and actuation algorithm proved to be effective to control the
    operating parameters of the sensor network (synchronization period, number of
    samples per period and irrigation orders) and to optimize the power consumption
    of the remote nodes. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

  analysis: 'An architecture for data fusion and detection, identification, and treatment
    of outliers within wireless sensor networks is discussed in this research article.
    The authors propose that using this platform enables the fusion of numerous sensor
    readings to overcome sensor unreliability. Low-cost sensors are often not reliable
    individually, making it essential to use data fusion methods to enhance the overall

    reducing node energy consumption, and detecting anomalous data (outliers) need
    to be addressed.

    The proposed architecture is based on the idea of organizing the flow of data
    and incorporating various data fusion techniques. It utilizes three layers: Local
    Fusion Layer, Low-Level Fusion Layer, Management Layer, and User Interface. The
    main contribution of the article lies in the definition of the Low-Level Fusion
    Layer, which is responsible for receiving data from the WSN, processing it, and
    forwarding it to the upper layers. Techniques commonly employed in the Local Fusion

    The architecture is evaluated through two case studies. The first case study involves
    low-cost barometric pressure sensors, and the second involves a large-scale scenario

    Science ((CCIS,volume 702)) Abstract The fields of precision agriculture, environmental
    engineering, among others, often have applications that use sensors to monitor
    the environment. Examples of such applications include pest control, irrigation
    process, soil fertility mapping, monitoring of forest areas and of urban rivers
    etc. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proposed as distributed infrastructures
    for these applications. These networks produce a large volume of data and use
    low-cost sensors. However, these sensors usually have low-reliability, generating
    anomalous data (outliers), affecting the final quality of the monitoring. These
    conditions imply the need to use methods for outlier detection and treatment,
    allowing the correct operation of the network and increasing the confidence in
    the monitored data. This article proposes an architecture for information fusion
    focusing on low-reliability sensors. The architecture is integrated with techniques
    for detection and treatment of outliers, and it was evaluated through two case
    studies. The first one involving low-cost barometric pressure sensors, whose monitored
    data were processed by outlier detection techniques. The second one involves the
    LUCE (Lausanne Urban Canopy Experiment) large-scale scenario, whose database is
    fed by 84 sensors for monitoring weather conditions. The results show that some
    of the low-level fusion methods and outliers detection techniques, when combined
    and organized according to the proposed architecture, can replace a single centralized,
    high-cost sensor, maintaining the confidence of the monitored data. Keywords Information

    A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a network composed of low-cost nodes,
    with small dimensions and with some processing and transmission capacity. In this
    type of network, nodes are equipped with sensors capable of monitoring scalars,
    and they have capabilities that go beyond of simply collecting information. They
    have features that allow them to analyze data, remove spurious data, detect events
    in the environment and perform data fusion of the sensor data, in order to reduce
    the amount of transmitted data. Usually, nodes communicate with a base station,
    thus data can be analyzed and eventually stored [1]. The application fields of
    these networks range from industrial, domestic, military, urban and rural areas
    [2]. WSNs are becoming widely used in automation monitoring processes of various
    physical phenomena. One advantages these networks is that they replace traditional
    centralized monitoring applications, where there is a single sensor monitoring
    the environment. This sensor, being unique, needs to be highly reliable, robust
    and expensive. The deployment of this sensor, in order to guarantee the measurements
    reliability, has a high cost associated. This centralized approach also entails
    costly maintenance because, commonly, data storage is done in data loggers that
    are dedicated devices for locally storing data collected by sensors. The high
    cost of maintenance is also a problem, since there is often a requirement that
    this type of sensor is deployed in places of difficult access, making it impossible
    to constantly replace its batteries and making difficult the access to data loggers.
    Consequently, several applications that use a WSN infrastructure, such as environmental
    monitoring, are no longer exclusively investigated by the academy and are gradually
    being adopted by companies, replacing traditional solutions [3]. However, there
    are several challenges that need to be overcome, for example: (i) large amount
    of data, (ii) energy consumption of nodes must be reduced and (iii) there are
    difficulties in detecting anomalous data, and when these data are detected, they
    need to classify whether they are spurious data (e.g. resulting from sensor failures)
    or relevant events in the environment (e.g. forest fire). This work focuses on
    problems (i) to (iii), dealing with them from the point of view of data fusion
    methods [4,5,6,7]. These techniques, through the mathematical manipulation of
    the monitored data set, are capable of handling large amounts of data and can
    reduce the energy consumption. Besides, they are able to increase the degree of
    truthfulness of the monitored network data. More specifically, this paper proposes
    that these problems can be treated in a systematic way, through an information
    fusion architecture that organizes data flow and the various activities required
    to integrate different types of data fusion techniques. The main question that
    motivates this work is to know if a set of low-cost sensors can replace the conventional
    use of centralized and high-cost sensors, maintaining, or even increasing, the
    degree of truthfulness achieved in the monitored data. In the following of this
    article, the relevant aspects of information fusion are presented in Sect. 2.
    The proposal of an architecture for the data fusion of WSN low-cost sensor data
    is presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, a case study is described, which uses low-cost
    barometric sensors. In Sect. 5, in order to assess the proposed architecture in
    an environment with a higher number of nodes and greater information traffic,
    is introduced a case study of temperature sensors installed in a large scale area.
    Finally, some final considerations and future works are presented. 2 Background
    2.1 Information Fusion Information Fusion (or data fusion) is a largely used denomination
    [3], and can be defined as the investigation of efficient methods that automatically
    or semi-automatically can transform information of several sources and with different
    time stamps to a consistent information. This information can be used by humans
    or machines for decision making. The advantages of using a multisensor information
    fusion are high availability, better spatial and temporal coverage and better
    accuracy and/or precision. However, when a large number of sensors present erroneous
    sensing values, the global performance of the system can be affected [8, 9]. Large
    WSNs based on low-cost nodes are generally used in the monitoring of scalars.
    However, these low-cost sensors are not reliable individually. Thus, data fusion
    methods are used to overcome this low reliability based on the fusion of several
    sensor readings. This way, data fusion can be used to detect outliers [10]. The
    techniques for information fusion can be classified according to the abstraction
    level of the sensed data [11]. In low-level data fusion, the raw sensed data is
    provided as inputs and combined directly with other raw data, assuming that the
    resulting data will present more accuracy than the individual inputs. In the intermediate
    level, the data abstraction occurs in such a way that it is possible to represent
    an object in a precise and concise way. In the high-level data fusion or decision-making
    process, decision-making takes place based on information from the low- and middle-level
    layers, where a priori knowledge and specific information about decision-making
    can be incorporated. Data Fusion can be also classified based on the topology
    of sensors [12]. In the complementary configuration, sensors do not depend directly
    on each other but act in a cooperative way to obtain a complete picture of the
    observed phenomenon. In a redundant configuration, independent measurements of
    the same property are provided at different times or by two or more sources at
    the same instant in order to provide better accuracy. In the cooperative configuration,
    information is provided by more than one sensor to derive information that would
    not be available if only one were used. Typically, in this type of data fusion,
    there is a loss of precision and reliability. 2.2 Outlier Detection Methods This
    section addresses some statistical methods for outlier detection in wireless sensor
    networks. The choice of these methods is justified: it does not require a history
    of the previous messages and the low computational nodes consumption. Detection
    can be performed, for example, by simple inspection of the sensor operating range.
    Therefore, the sensed data that are outside the sensor operational range must
    be discarded. In outlier data fusion methods, the data of the sensors are compared
    in order to detect possible conflicting sensors. Several data fusion algorithms
    can be considered. In our architecture, we consider as an appropriate algorithm,
    the one with the ability to compare the data obtained by the sensors involved
    in the data fusion and, following a specific criterion, to decide whether or not
    to suppress its data. However, it is not desirable to unnecessarily exclude sensor
    observations when the readings are correct. Besides, it is convenient that when
    an observation is discarded, somehow the algorithm has the ability to clearly
    mark or show which sensor and why the data must discarded. Due to uncertainty
    about the quality of the low-cost sensors, it is desirable that the algorithm
    has mechanisms capable of computing sensor quality during the data fusion process.
    A widely used method for data fusion is a simple average, which is not suitable
    for the vast majority of applications. The following subsections describe the
    main characteristics of methods evaluated in this article. It is important to
    note that there are several other techniques that could be evaluated, such as,
    for example, techniques based on the Kalman filter [8]. However, these approaches
    are statefull, since they require a history of the previous messages of each sensor,
    and the methods studied in this paper are stateless. A. Fault Tolerant Average
    - FTA One of the methods of sensor fusion with a simple application and good results
    is the Fault Tolerant Average (FTA) proposed by [13]. Basically, it divides an
    ordered set of data into three parts, eliminating the edges. The first step in
    this technique is to sort the set of data sent by the sensor nodes. Taking \(t
    = N / 3\), where N is the size of the set, we discard the borders of the ordered
    sample, that is, the largest and the smallest t values. This approach assumes
    that if there are outliers, they will be removed along with those “extreme” values.
    The final value is the calculation of mean and standard deviation of the remaining
    values. B. Confidence-Weighted Averaging - CWA Elmenreich [3] proposed a data
    fusion method setting for each sensor a value of “confidence” inversely associated
    with the variance of the sensor. Variance is a useful measure in many cases because
    they are additive, thus different groups of data can be compared. The standard
    deviation, in turn, has the advantage of being expressed in the same unit as the
    measured variable, making it easier to compare results. Following this approach,
    in the best case, the variance is close to zero, achieving a maximum confidence
    value. The worst-case variance can be calculated as the variation of a random
    function evenly distributed between the limits a and b, where these values are
    the minimum and maximum values of a uniformly distributed random function. C.
    CWA+FTA Method Elmenreich [3] suggested that CWA could be used in conjunction
    with other methods, such as FTA proposed by [13]. Thus the method becomes fault
    tolerant and considers the quality of the sensor in the data fusion. The method
    consists of calculating the weighted mean including all sensors using the CWA
    method and subsequently eliminating 2/3 of the sensors as specified in the FTA
    and calculating the weighted average again. D. Modified CWA with a Test of Fixed
    Value Locked Sensor The method proposed in [3] to fuse information from different
    sensors, prioritizes the sensors with lower variance. An exception pointed out
    by the author of the algorithm is that, if the variance is zero, some treatment
    to avoid division by zero is required. However, in preliminary experiments carried
    out in this work, another problem was observed, since, as the proposed architecture
    is focused on WSNs using low-cost sensors. It was observed in some execution scenarios
    that readings of data collected by a single sensor could have equal values for
    a long period of time, characterizing a faulty and locked sensor. This sensor
    lock may be permanent or temporary for a short or long time. This locked sensor,
    due to its low variance, makes its incorrect data contribute to a greater weight
    in the calculation of the weighted average than the correct sensors. Thus, a simple
    alteration of the original algorithm was necessary for implementation. Basically,
    when a sensor exhibits variations between readings below and a specified value
    (and dependent on the type and specification of the sensor), its calculated variance
    will be artificially increased to the maximum possible value, thus contributing
    minimally to the weighted average calculation. E. Chauvenet Method The Chauvenet
    criterion is a statistical method that was developed for detection of outliers,
    and can be used to Byzantine fault detection. It is based on the hypothesis that
    an arbitrary measurement can be rejected if the probability of obtaining the deviation
    from the mean to this value is less than the inverse of twice the number of measurements
    [14]. The sample size is very important in using the method because, with a large
    sample, there is little chance that one of the values influence the average significantly.
    A divergent value in a large sample should be very far from the average to move
    to distribution. This makes the use of few data requirements. F. Peirce Criterion
    The Peirce method is a statistical technique for detecting outliers, in a sample
    with normal behavior. The original article dates from 1852, however, it is widely
    used on current days [14]. The basic idea of the proposed method is that the observations
    should be rejected when the actual deviations from the mean obtained by keeping
    them, are less than the deviations obtained by its rejection, multiplied by the
    probability of making as many and not more, unusual observations. Hence, the goal
    of his technique was to generate error probabilities occurring in the system where
    all n observations are retained versus the rejected samples. Thus, k observations
    are rejected and it checks whether the sample is closer to normal than previous
    one. The Peirce Criterion provides for detection of more than one discordant data
    in the sample. However, Peirce’s calculation method is mathematically complex
    to use. In this way, there are tables derived from the work of Peirce [15] that
    can be used To improve the performance of the calculations. 3 Architecture for
    Low-Cost Sensor Data Fusion In this paper we propose an architecture for monitoring
    with WSN and divides the activities carried out into three layers: Local Fusion
    Layer, Low-Level Fusion Layer, Management Layer and User Interface (Fig. 1). Fig.
    1. Proposed architecture for sensor data fusion in WSN. Full size image The main
    contribution of this article is in the definition of the Low-Level Fusion Layer,
    which is responsible for receiving data from the WSN, processing, and forwarding
    to the Management Layer and User Interface layer [11]. Techniques commonly employed
    in the Local Fusion Layer are presented in the following. 3.1 Local Data Fusion
    Layer The purpose of this level of processing is to configure the sensors to collect
    data about the environment where they are inserted, to perform some type of local
    data fusion, and to forward the data for the transmission. One of the first steps
    is to check with the sensor manufacturer the recommended sampling rates. It is
    also necessary to check if there is any kind of adjustment to be made in the sensor,
    such as micro calibration. Depending on the rate, it can be applied locally to
    the data, such as the arithmetic average. Some methods in the upper layers of
    the architecture may use other information in its processing, such as variance
    or variance generated by the local data fusion method. For the calculation of
    these values, a good option is to perform the fusion between beacons Footnote
    1. 3.2 The Low-Level Data Fusion Layer The low-level data fusion layer is subdivided
    into: calibration; timestamping; detection of systematic and gross errors; methods
    of fusion and feedback (Fig. 1). Sensor calibration is a fundamental problem in
    WSN [16]. It consists of the set of establishes and corrects the difference between
    a measured value and the true value. In some cases, it may consist of an additive
    or multiplicative correction of the indication with a measurement uncertainty.
    As the true value is ignored, the calibration tends to minimize the difference
    between the read value and the true value of importance. The calibration of each
    device, individually and manually, known as a micro-calibration may be intractable
    when a large number of sensors is considered [16]. Therefore, self-calibration
    can be employed in this process. A conventional calibration is the readings corrections
    of each sensor based on a common reference, or be based on the reference of a
    sensors group [17]. In the proposed architecture, low-level data fusion can be
    executed online or offline. In the case of off-line data fusion, cluster heads
    do not perform the role of fusion centers, they only forward the data received
    towards the PAN coordinator, where the data fusion will be carried out. Offline
    data fusion can be considered for further study of the observed environment. In
    this case, it is necessary to associate time stamps referring to the moment of
    observation of each stored data. Data Fusion Centers play an important role in
    the Low-level Data Fusion when online data fusion occur, being paramount in WSN
    that also have actuators, so that their results can be used immediately. 4 Experimental
    Assessment The proposed architecture is tested through a case study. An environmental
    monitoring application based on atmospheric pressure is used to validate the proposal.
    Atmospheric pressure is important for several applications like meteorology and
    environmental engineering. Usually, just one sensor (high-quality sensor) is used,
    however, it is a high-cost sensor. The chosen place to execute the experiments
    was near the Hercilio Luz Airport in Florianópolis, SC-Brazil. Figure 2 shows
    the external reference sensor that was used for comparison (identified in this
    work as Vaisala), this reference sensor is used by the Brazilian Air Force and
    is located near the end of an airport landing strip, at 5 m high. The distance
    between the airport sensor (reference sensor) and the site of the experiments
    is 1300 m. Moreover, aiming the comparison between the low-cost sensor and the
    reference sensor, another reference sensor was used (identified in this work as
    internal reference sensor Young). Fig. 2. Place of experiment. Full size image
    The communication between experimental sensors was performed based on an IEEE
    802.15.4 wireless sensor network in star topology. Four low-cost sensors were
    used in the experiments, which is required by data fusion techniques discussed
    in previous sessions of this paper. The fifth node was configured as a PAN coordinator,
    this node is responsible for storing data. The WSN was configured in beacon mode,
    PAN coordinator is responsible for synchronizing the networks through beacon sending.
    In order to configure the network the periodicity of the application was BO =11,
    that defines a Beacon Interval (BI) of 30 s. Other nodes were equipped with the
    low-cost sensor, and the system was implemented over the MAC layer. This way,
    it was not used WSN operating systems like TinyOS or FreeRTOS. Nodes 1, 2, 3 and
    4 use 2 1.5 V batteries for the embedded system and sensors. Node 5 use AC/DC
    power and was connected to a computer using serial communication. The collected
    data were stored in text file using the following format: \({<}timestamp, node
    [1 - 10],\) variance \([1 - 10]{>}\). The base station computer was synchronized
    through NTP protocol, the same protocol used in the airport system. The data fusion
    was performed later due to experiment constraints. 4.1 Experimental Results The
    first data analysis was based on internal and external reference sensor. The main
    goal was to verify the proximity of internal and external reference sensors. It
    was selected data regarding 24 h of readings and the average of atmospheric pressure
    was calculated (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Reference sensors comparison. Full size image
    In order to make the comparison, it was necessary to compute the difference of
    altitude among two sensors (more or less 1.5 m), that is 0.1 hPa. Besides the
    altitude, it was considered the precision of sensors. It is informed that sensor
    readings may vary 0,3 hPa, thus the reading difference between two sensors can
    not be over 0,6 hPa. It was observed that the maximum difference was 0,25 hPa.
    Thus, we considered that the reference sensor is validated, this validation is
    based on external reference sensor (Vaisala) that is periodically calibrated,
    because these readings are used for landing and take-off operations. The data
    collected by sensors and the results obtained by data fusion will be compared
    just with the internal reference sensor. Diverse analysis was performed in order
    to assess the data fusion techniques. In this paper, we present an analysis of
    a data sample that contains an incorrect sensor (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Data sample
    with a discordant sensor. Full size image It is possible to note that this sensor
    always sends the same atmospheric pressure reading, thus it is considered a high
    precision sensor (variance zero). However, the difference observed is due to the
    low battery level of nodes. Figure 4 shows that values of Bosch4 sensor remain
    different from reference sensor 1.31 hPa, and other sensors just 0,07 hPa. Fig.
    5. Application of data fusion methods. Full size image Figure 5 shows the results
    of data fusion techniques over these data. The average method shows the worst
    performance due to the fact that all data are considered in the data fusion method.
    The erroneous sensor in the sample causes a distortion in the final result and
    it is not possible to detect the outlier. The Chauvenet method detects the sensor
    4 as an outlier, obtaining the same result of the arithmetic mean. It is interesting
    to note that if the reference sensor was considered in data fusion, the Chauvenet
    method would achieve a better performance: the outlier would be eliminated and
    the average will be performed with other sensors. The Peirce method could also
    detect the sensor 4 as an outlier. The maximum difference between reference sensor
    and the data fusion value was 0.03 hPa. MTF always discard the values of 2/3 of
    sensors, even if these values are similar, this behavior is not noticed in Chauvenet
    and Peirce. Elmenreich method (CWA) can be considered a complete method, because
    it considers the sensor quality. However, the variance values must be available.
    There are three ways to execute the method. The first one considers just variance
    informed by sensors (CWA); the second way includes the modifications proposed
    in this paper (altered CWA) and, finally, the modified CWA algorithm combined
    with a fault tolerant average (CWA+FTA). It is possible to notice that results
    presented in Table 1 show that Elmenreich method (CWA) presents a bad performance,
    obtaining a 1,2 hPa from the reference sensor. This result shows that when a sensor
    presents equal readings, the variance is zero and the system presents the highest
    level of confidence in the faulty sensor. Table 1. Elmenreich method. Full size
    table When modified CWA method is used, we consider that a sensor with constant
    variance near zero, during a certain period, is considered an outlier, and its
    variance is artificially raised to a maximum value. Thus, the use of faulty sensor
    in the weighted average does not change the result, and an approximate value from
    the reference sensor was achieved. CWA+MTF achieved values near the reference
    values. Table 2 shows the results of MTF and CWA+MTF. It is possible to notice
    that readings of sensor 2 were considered by all methods and the values from sensor
    4 were discarded by CWA+MTF and MTF. However, sensor 1 even presenting correct
    readings was discarded in 80% of data fusion tasks. When MTF results are compared
    with reference sensor readings, 0,02 hPa value is showed. Table 2. MTF and CWA+MTF
    averages with sensor 4 as a source of outliers. Full size table 5 Simulation Assessment
    of a Large-Area WSN In the previous section, it was concluded that the use of
    low-cost sensors in a cooperative way to perform the monitoring is equivalent
    in terms of results to the use of a centralized high-cost sensor. In this section,
    the goal is to extend the scenario and number of nodes to evaluate the behavior
    of statistical methods to detect outliers in WSN. Based on this premise and due
    to the technical difficulties to build a real large-scale WSN, a simulator was
    used for this study. Fig. 6. Sensorscope Lausanne Urban Canopy Experiment (LUCE).
    Full size image 5.1 Large-Area Scenario Description The dataset used for the simulation
    and validation of the methods has been obtained through the project LUCE Footnote
    2 (Lausanne Urban Canopy Experience). The WSN that was structured in a campus
    of the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EFPL). This network was deployed
    with 110 nodes distributed over an area of 300\(\,\times \,\)400 m, characterizing
    a large-scale WSN [18]. The objective of this project was to monitor the meteorological
    changes and various data was collected, such as temperature, relative air humidity,
    wind speed among other physical magnitudes. The data collected, and made available
    for public use, corresponds to the period from July 2006 to May 2007. In this
    paper, just 85 nodes were used in the simulator, being one of them assumed as
    the coordinator of the network (sink). The distribution of the nodes across the
    campus is illustrated in Fig. 6. The data used to assess the methods was sensed
    in a 24-hour period, referring to April 03, 2007; and just one physical scalar
    was used: the temperature. For the WSN simulation, the Castalia 3.0 framework
    was used Footnote 3. Castalia is an open source simulator based on the OMNeT++
    platform Footnote 4, and focused on WSNs and BANs (Body Area Networks) simulation.
    The reason for its choice was motivated by the great acceptance and use in the
    WSN community for its realistic characteristics, in terms of radio models, as
    well as the possibility to change algorithms and protocols [19]. 5.2 Evaluated
    Methods Four outlier statistical techniques were evaluated using the Castalia
    simulator. These methods were selected based on their characteristics, previously
    highlighted, that best meet the sensor networks scenario. The methods evaluated
    were: Chauvenet, Peirce, FTA and CWA+FTA. Parametrizing the simulations for the
    evaluated methods: The monitoring was performed every 30 s and after obtaining
    30 readings the outlier detection method was applied; Each sensor node uses the
    outlier detection algorithm; After the detection process, each node sends to the
    coordinator the average. In order to analyze the efficiency of the outlier detection
    methods, outliers were inserted into the monitoring data. The choice of outliers
    values was chosen at random. In order to analyze the results, nine nodes with
    the best frequency of submissions to the coordinator were selected. The chosen
    nodes reached 100% of freight rate and 36 outliers were distributed between nodes.
    The Fig. 7 shows the temperature readings of nodes in a fifteen minute period
    together based on artificial outliers. It is possible to observe the discrepancy
    of the values and the need for treatment so that these anomalous data do not change
    the result, thus modifying the real value of the means. Thus, results for the
    analyzed methods were described: Fig. 7. Sensed values with/without outliers’
    detection. Full size image Chauvenet: Chauvenet method detected 13 outliers from
    36 artificial outliers (Table 3). As can be seen in Fig. 8, points from the temperature
    of 10 \(^\circ \)C, have many points farther from the normal behavior of the captured
    readings. Peirce: Peirce technique shows a behavior very similar to that of Chauvenet,
    13 outliers were correctly identified (Table 3). In Fig. 9, it is possible to
    notice that the undiscovered outliers present results very similar to the Chauvenet
    method. FTA Method: This method proved to be very efficient in outliers detection,
    it was able to find all the inserted outliers (Table 3). Despite being a relatively
    simple method it proved to be efficient for detection and removal of outliers.
    Figure 10 above shows the readings resulting from the FTA method, a problem identified
    is the aimless removal even of values that are not considered anomalous by always
    excluding 2/3 of samples. CWA+FTA: The Elmenreich technique combined with FTA
    method obtained results similar to the FTA method, reaching 100% efficiency in
    outliers detection (Table 3). Fig. 8. Event detection using Chauvenet method.
    Full size image Fig. 9. Event detection using Peirce method. Full size image Fig.
    10. Event detection using FTA method. Full size image Fig. 11. Result of detection
    with the CWA+FTA method. Full size image 5.3 Comparative Analysis of Methods The
    methods have generally obtained good results in the detection of large-scale WSN
    outliers. However, the FTA and CWA+FTA methods detected 100% of the outliers.
    On the other hand, Peirce and Chauvenet methods detected just 36.11% of the outliers.
    Table 3 shows the outliers detected per node. Table 3. Amount of outliers detected.
    Full size table The Table 4 presents the final averages of the readings of the
    nodes by analyzed method. The Table 4 shows the resulting averages. As a result,
    the table shows that outliers detection techniques are necessary to provide higher
    accuracy in monitoring. In the analysis, nodes 1, 15 and 18 present high averages,
    the presence of outliers, which do not correspond to the normal behavior of the
    temperature variation in that period. In this way, it must be withdrawn in order
    to not disturb the final average. For example at node 15, six outliers were inserted
    into the set of readings, which resulted in an average of 20.63 \(^\circ \)C degrees.
    After the application of the CWA+FTA technique, the average resulted in 9.61 \(^\circ
    \)C degrees. Thus, an average reduction in temperature was 46.58% when compared
    to the average with outliers. FTA technique presented a reduction of 46.97%, while
    Chauvenet and Peirce techniques did not change the average. Thus, outliers were
    not removed. After the detection and removal of the outliers with the FTA and
    CWA+FTA techniques, it is possible to observe the regularization of final node
    average, through a data fusion information more accurate and reliable (Fig. 11).
    Table 4. Local averages obtained by each technique, in degrees Celsius. Full size
    table In summary, comparing the outliers detection capability, both the CWA+FTA
    and the FTA technique achieved the same results, Table 4. Regarding precision,
    the techniques also obtained similar results, according to Table 4. 6 Conclusions
    WSNs based on low-cost sensors have been replacing the traditional centralized
    systems that use a single, reliable, high-cost sensor. WSN advantages like deployment
    flexibility, better area coverage and low-cost sensors are the main reasons for
    its choose. However, new challenges emerge as these networks become popular. For
    example, they generate a large amount of data, need to have an adequate operation
    due to its limited energy budget, as well as failures and errors caused by WSN
    nodes equipped with low-cost sensors. Thus the use of raw data generated by sensor
    nodes has not been suitable. Therefore, this work focuses on these problems, treating
    them from the point of view of the methods of information fusion, that is, techniques
    that reduce the amount of data and increase its reliability. The proposed architecture
    was applied in the monitoring of environments. Low-cost sensors were calibrated
    based on a reference sensor. Without this operation, the fusion methods would
    not reach the expected performance due to the constant deviation of the values
    observed in the low-cost sensors. The timestamps were added, making it feasible
    to perform offline the data fusion. Systematic and gross errors, such as “zero”
    values, were correctly discarded before reaching the fusion methods. Among the
    experimentally tested methods, Peirce and CWA+FTA were more suitable for the fusion
    of the sensors. However, the arithmetic means, Chauvenet and CWA without modifications,
    did not perform well in the presence of faulty nodes. In the simulation of a large-scale
    WSN, the CWA+MTF and FTA methods were the best at eliminating all outliers; while
    the Chauvenet and Peirce methods did not perform satisfactorily since they did
    not detect much of the outliers. Regarding accuracy, the Chauvenet and Peirce
    techniques obtained poor results in their means when compared to CWA+FTA and FTA.
    Therefore, the CWA+FTA and FTA techniques have achieved good results in the large-scale
    simulated WSN scenarios giving good detection, accuracy and reliability in monitoring.
    As a conclusion, the WSN configuration used in conjunction with low-cost sensors
    and the proposed architecture deliver as good performance as the use of a single
    high-cost sensor. Notes 1. Beacons are control packets periodically generated

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\
    \ 8.\nTable 2. Common wireless nodes used in the agriculture domain.\nSr #\nWN1\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    \ are scarce and urban areas consume the vast majority \nof these resources, it\
    \ is vital to make cities greener and more sustainable. Advanced \nsystems to\
    \ improve and automate processes within a city will play a leading role in smart\
    \ \ncities. From smart design of buildings, which capture rain water for later\
    \ use, to intelligent \ncontrol systems, which can monitor infrastructures autonomously,\
    \ the possible \nimprovements enabled by sensing technologies are immense. Ubiquitous\
    \ sensing poses \nnumerous challenges, which are of a technological or social\

    \ In an effort to provide a holistic view of how sensing technologies \nplay a\
    \ role in smart cities, a range of applications and technical challenges associated\
    \ with \nthese applications are discussed. As some of these applications and technologies\
    \ belong to \ndifferent disciplines, the material presented in this paper attempts\
    \ to bridge these to provide \na broad overview, which can be of help to researchers\
    \ and developers in understanding \nhow advanced sensing can play a role in smart\

    A smart city is a city which functions in a sustainable and intelligent way, by\
    \ integrating all its \ninfrastructures and services into a cohesive whole and\
    \ using intelligent devices for monitoring and \ncontrol, to ensure sustainability\
    \ and efficiency [1]. In a world where population numbers are constantly \nrising,\
    \ significantly driving the consumption of resources causing resource shortages\
    \ and climate \nchange, the incentive for innovative solutions is evident. Urban\
    \ areas, in particular, are responsible for \nthe major part of resource consumption,\
    \ instigating an increasing need to create smarter infrastructures, \nin search\
    \ of greener and more energy efficient urban dynamics. Solutions to these issues\
    \ comprise of \nimprovements to a majority of components of urban dynamics, as\
    \ illustrated in Figure 1. \nFigure 1. Sensing in smart cities. \nThe Smart \n\
    City\nSmart \nInfrastructures\nSmart Electricity \nand Water \ndistribution\n\
    Smart \nTransportation\nSmart \nBuildings\nSmart \nSurveillance\nSmart Services\n\
    Smart \nHealthcare\n \nIt is predicted that the global economy will be significantly\
    \ disproportionate due the growth of \ncities, with forecasts that by 2050 more\
    \ than 6 billion people will live in urban areas [2]. This growth \nwill aggravate\
    \ further existing energy and climate related challenges. To solve these challenges,\
    \ cities \nwhich are more resource efficient and technology driven, are necessary.\
    \ \nSensing is at the heart of smart infrastructures, which can monitor themselves\
    \ and act on their own \nintelligently. Using sensors to monitor public infrastructures,\
    \ such as bridges, roads and buildings, \nprovides awareness that enables a more\
    \ efficient use of resources, based on the data collected by these \nsensors.\
    \ Real-time monitoring eliminates the need for regular scheduled inspections,\
    \ therefore \nreducing costs; measuring energy consumption in households allows\
    \ for accurate load forecasting; and \nsensors deployed in roads for traffic monitoring\
    \ collect data which is necessary for the implementation \nof intelligent transportation\
    \ systems (ITS). \nFor these approaches to be effective, sensors have to be deployed\
    \ in very large numbers and they \nhave to be interconnected, so that the collected\
    \ data can be sent to a central information system, where \nintelligent decisions\
    \ based on this data can be made. This poses a number of challenges. Firstly,\
    \ there \nneeds to be a communication infrastructure in place for these sensors\
    \ to communicate with each other. \nSecondly, what is the most efficient way to\
    \ aggregate and process this data? \nSensors 2013, 13 \n395 \n \n \nAspects related\
    \ to sensing in smart cities as well as efficient processing of data collected\
    \ by these \nsensors is discussed in the remainder of this paper. It is organized\
    \ as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review \nthe current state of sensing and enabling\
    \ technologies, respectively. In Section 4 existing sensing \nplatforms for smart\
    \ cities are discussed, and in Section 5 sensing applications in smart cities\
    \ are \ndiscussed. Some ongoing and future pilot projects for smart cities are\
    \ described in Section 6. \nChallenges and future directions are discussed in\
    \ Section 7, and the paper is concluded in Section 8. \n2. The Sensing Evolution\
    \ \nSensors are a crucial component of any intelligent control system. A process\
    \ is improved based on \nits environment and for a control system to be aware\
    \ of its environment, it is typically fitted with an \narray of sensors, from\
    \ which it collects the required data. It then uses the appropriate variables\
    \ to \ncharacterize its environment and adjusts its operations accordingly.  \n\
    The availability of a multitude of different sensors and continuously evolving\
    \ technology enable \napplications that were infeasible in the past due to high\
    \ costs and limited availability. Technology \nadvances not only drive the innovation\
    \ behind sensors, they also enable sufficient processing power for \nsmall-scale\
    \ devices to which these sensors can be interfaced to at a relatively low cost.\
    \ From the \nperspective of the requirements for smart cities, wide availability\
    \ of these technologies translates to a \nlarge number of opportunities in terms\
    \ of sensing. \nAs an example within the context of the smart city, meters to\
    \ determine gas, electricity and water \nconsumption have traditionally been mechanical.\
    \ However, smart metering implies a new generation \nof technologies [3]. As with\
    \ mechanical solutions, they must be robust, cheap, easy to maintain and \nreliable,\
    \ as their readings will be used to determine billing. Electricity meter readings\
    \ have evolved \nfrom the manual procedure of reading the mechanical meter, to\
    \ automatic meter reading (AMR) which \nwere deployed to reduce costs and improve\
    \ the accuracy of meter readings, eventually to an advanced \nmetering infrastructure\
    \ (AMI) which differs from the AMR in that it enables two-way communications \n\
    with the meter, driven by a growing understanding of the benefits of two-way interactions\
    \ between \nsystem operators, consumers and their loads and resources. \nA sensor\
    \ is a converter which converts parameters of a physical nature to an electronic\
    \ signal, \nwhich can be interpreted by humans or can be fed into an autonomous\
    \ system. These signals for \nconventional sensors, amongst others, include light,\
    \ pressure, temperature, humidity, moisture and a \nvariety of other parameters.\
    \  \nMore sophisticated sensors include accelerometers which can be used to measure\
    \ acceleration and \nvibration. In the context of structural health monitoring\
    \ (SHM), for instance, sensors like corrosion rate \nsensors (working on the principle\
    \ of an increase in electrical resistivity due to corrosion); acoustic \nemission\
    \ sensors (used to detect propagation of sound waves); and magneto-strictive sensors\
    \ (detects \nthe change in magnetic induction in the material caused by strain\
    \ or stress). An even later generation of \nsensors is based on semiconductor\
    \ physics and nano-technology, and intelligent sensing devices \ninclude, amongst\
    \ others, smart phones. \nCMOS based sensing, due to the relative low cost, enables\
    \ a range of smart sensors. In [4], a smart \ntemperature sensor with a one-point\
    \ calibration technique and MOSFET circuits is proposed. This \nsensor is primarily\
    \ aimed at low-power devices. Other CMOS-based sensor applications include \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n396 \n \n \nmonitoring the quality of food products, by observing\
    \ the temperature and time of exposure, which are \nparameters related to the\
    \ quality of food products [5]. Within the context of the smart city, these \n\
    devices can also sense air and water quality, amongst others. \nIn particular,\
    \ stick-on or printed sensors can be attached to devices as labels to measure\
    \ various \nphysical parameters, such as humidity [6], temperature [7] and gas\
    \ [8]. Also, sensors have been \nproposed in plastic foil, e.g., chemical gas\
    \ sensors, implemented on a variety of substrates, coated with \na sensing film.\
    \ These enable sensing of multiple parameters from a single sensor. For instance,\
    \ on a \nsingle flexible foil, a multi-parameter sensor for temperature, humidity\
    \ and gas, using flexible \npolyimide foils, is proposed in [9], with the capability\
    \ of sensing propane and similar gases. A possible \napplication for these sensors,\
    \ as indicated in [9], is humidity monitoring, by embedding these sensors \ninto\
    \ construction materials, or environmental monitoring [10], an important capability\
    \ for smart cities. \nNano-technology, although mostly applicable for bio-sensing\
    \ applications, is a key enabling \ntechnology for sensor development, as advances\
    \ in nano-technology will undoubtedly drive \ndevelopment in MEMS and photonics,\
    \ inevitably leading to the development of highly sophisticated \nbut low-cost\
    \ sensors. This technology will enable applications where not only an individual’s\
    \ \nsurroundings can be sensed, but also the person’s health, at high granularity,\
    \ for instance, and linked to \nsocial networks. \nThe ever increasing number\
    \ of smartphones opens up a totally new sensing scenario. Smartphones \nare fitted\
    \ with a variety of sensors such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses,\
    \ enabling a \nvariety of crowd sourcing applications, which will eventually be\
    \ augmented by the Internet of Things. \nIn particular, collaborative data collection\
    \ is a popular crowd sourcing application. Crowd sourcing \nwill be discussed\
    \ in Section 5.10. \n3. Enabling Technologies \nSome technical issues regarding\
    \ communication between sensor nodes still have to be resolved. In \nthe context\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), the communication between sensors nodes has\
    \ to be \nwireless, as cabling costs for millions of sensors is impractical and\
    \ extremely expensive. Low power \ncommunication standards, suitable for an extremely\
    \ large number of devices and their heterogeneity, \nare necessary. In particular,\
    \ depending on location and necessary coverage, there are a number of \ndifferent\
    \ networks in smart cities. Depending on location and coverage, these can be classified\
    \ as [11]: \nHome Area Networks: these typically use short range standards, with\
    \ operating frequencies in \nthe ISM bands. Standards include ZigBee, Dash7 and\
    \ Wi-Fi (802.11 g/n), or wired standards \nsuch as Ethernet. All the monitoring\
    \ and control system’s components in a home are connected \nby the HAN. \nWide\
    \ Area Networks: these provide for communication between utilities and customers’\
    \ \npremises, which requires a much broader coverage than HANs, with infrastructure\
    \ such as \nleased lines based on optic fiber or broadband wireless, e.g., 3G\
    \ and LTE, and managed by \nservice providers. \nField Area Networks: typically\
    \ used in a smart grid to connect customers’ premises to substations. \nTable\
    \ 1 compares the different communication standards listed in this section. \n\

    \ ZigBee \nWith the advent of ubiquitous computing, one of the concepts of smart\
    \ cities is to have sensors \ndeployed virtually everywhere, in the millions,\
    \ such as in PlanIT Valley, where the aim is to have  \n100 million sensors. As\
    \ sensor nodes are typically designed to be low-power devices, the communication\
    \ \nstandard has to take that into account, as communication consumes the most\
    \ energy. \nLow power standards like IEEE 802.15.4 have limited range and a significant\
    \ number of repeaters \nwould have to be deployed in a city for full coverage.\
    \ Additionally, addressing schemes would have to \nsupport billions of devices.\
    \ 6LoWPAN defines mechanisms which allow transmission of IPv6 packets \nover IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 based networks. Although this certainly presents itself as a solution\
    \ to the \naddressing issue, the coverage issue is tightly coupled to the communication\
    \ technology itself, which is \ninherently short range (in the order of hundred\
    \ meters). \n3.2. Dash7 \nDash7 is a promising standard for WSNs and is aimed\
    \ at long distance, low power sensing \napplications. Some of these applications\
    \ include building automation and logistics, to name a few. This \nprotocol stack\
    \ has a very small footprint; its communication range is in the order of kilometers;\
    \ and it \noperates at 433 MHz, a frequency which allows better penetration than\
    \ 2.4 GHz [12]. For home area \nnetworks (HANs), for instance, this frequency\
    \ is appealing, as it allows better penetration through \nwalls than 2.4 GHz.\
    \ For wide area networks (WANs), Dash7 is also appealing because of the long \n\
    ranges. Dash7 has received considerable attention for military applications, including\
    \ substantial \ninvestments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there\
    \ is no significant active academically \ndriven research focused on Dash7. \n\
    3.3. 3G and LTE \nIn terms of existing wireless communication infrastructures,\
    \ 3G and LTE, have available \ninfrastructures worldwide, even in third world\
    \ countries. These technologies are meant for broadband \nconnectivity, and were\
    \ not designed for short range, low power operation. Although they have been \n\
    adopted by mobile devices such as smartphones, these devices operate on a rechargeable\
    \ battery, in \ncontrast to sensor nodes which are ideally deployed sparsely,\
    \ with no intention of charging or \nreplacing batteries. Furthermore, these services\
    \ are provided by service providers and the data cost is \nstill relatively expensive\
    \ compared to their fixed line counterparts such as ADSL. With millions of \n\
    sensors uploading gigabytes or even terabytes (in case of video) of data to the\
    \ cloud, these \ntechnologies are rendered infeasible for IoT. Furthermore, these\
    \ standards are not optimized for use in \nSensors 2013, 13 \n398 \n \n \nsensor\
    \ networks (i.e., low power). Hence, for these technologies to be adopted for\
    \ sensor networks, \npower consumption has to be considered. In the absence of\
    \ embedding these technologies into the \nsensor node (i.e., integrating LTE or\
    \ 3G into the sensor platform), gateways can be used between the \nsensor devices\
    \ and the web, as shown in [13]. LTE, in particular, has been a main enabler of\
    \ high \nperformance M2M applications, due to coverage, high throughput and low\
    \ latency. \n3.4. RFID and NFC \nWith regards to short range communication, there\
    \ are two prominent technologies in the context of \nsmart cities. Radio Frequency\
    \ Identification (RFID) consists of an RFID tag (which can be either \npassive\
    \ or active), where data is stored, and an RFID reader, which induces an electromagnetic\
    \ field \nwhen in near proximity to passive tags and by this means provides power\
    \ to the devices (longer ranges \nfor active tags), enabling it to read data from\
    \ the tag’s memory. RFID enables a range of applications \nfor smart cities, such\
    \ as localization and tracking of objects [14], healthcare applications [15],\
    \ asset \nmanagement [16] and smart parking [17], to name a few. As the circuitry\
    \ in tags is printed, it is natural \nto integrate these tags with smart label\
    \ sensors, therefore creating RFID tags which do not only \ncontain data which\
    \ has been manually written, but they also capture environmental data as described\
    \  \nin [9]. Hence, each tag can also act as a sensor. Additionally, because passive\
    \ tags are inexpensive, \nthese can be deployed in very large numbers for pervasive\
    \ sensing. Furthermore, the passive nature of \nthese tags translates to low cost\
    \ and low power consumption, as these tags only need to be powered \nwhen needed.\
    \ \nNear Field Communication (NFC) is used in mobile and similar devices, for\
    \ a very short  \nbi-directional communication range (in contrast with RFID which\
    \ is unidirectional). These ranges are \nusually in the centimeter range. The\
    \ recent integration of NFC into smartphones has enabled a range of \napplications\
    \ which facilitate day-to-day activities and enable smart living. A selection\
    \ of general \napplications which have emerged with NFC is given: \nThe most predominant\
    \ application of NFC is the digital wallet. This allows customers to use their\
    \ \nsmartphones as a substitute for their cards, which can be for public transportation,\
    \ bank, access control \nor identification [18]. \nSince NFC is bidirectional,\
    \ it is possible to use it to share data between devices, multimedia as well \n\
    as documents, such as business cards or similar contact information [19]. \nOccupancy\
    \ and user context in smart homes are accomplished by placing NFC tags at strategic\
    \ \nlocations in a house and have these tags interface with the central information\
    \ system It is possible to \ndetermine whether a user has entered a room and to\
    \ change the settings according to the location  \n(e.g., switch on Wi-Fi if the\
    \ user enters the house) [17]. \nThe following are real-world examples of NFC\
    \ application within the context of the smart city: \nSmart energy metering: NFC-enabled\
    \ post-pay electricity meters were deployed in the city of \nChongqing, China,\
    \ which enable consumers to read their smart meters with an NFC phone. \nPayment\
    \ for the electricity is automatically done after the encrypted reading has been\
    \ send \nover-the-air to the service’s banking back-end [20]. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n399 \n \n \nData acquisition and control: NFC enabled smartphones can be\
    \ used to interface with control \nsystems for remote control [21] and can be\
    \ used as platforms for advanced measurement and \nprocessing [22]. \nCity touristic\
    \ surfing: with an NFC enabled smart phone and smart posters disseminated \nalong\
    \ the city, the user can navigate through points of interest within the city [23].\
    \ \nSmart car parks: motorists can use their NFC enabled smart phone as an electronic\
    \ ticket to \nenter the parking lot and when leaving as an electronic wallet to\
    \ affect payment [24]. \nWith the addition of NFC to smartphones and the widespread\
    \ of smartphones, NFC is envisaged as \na key enabling technology in smart cities.\
    \ \n4. Sensing Platforms \nWith the advent of ubiquitous sensing, various devices\
    \ and platforms are currently available  \nfor this purpose. Although ideas to\
    \ implement these platforms have been around for decades, only \nrecently have\
    \ these systems been feasible from a cost perspective, driven by reduced manufacturing\
    \ \ncosts as well as low-cost electronic components such as radio transceivers,\
    \ microcontrollers, \nmicroprocessors and sensors. Sourcing these components in\
    \ bulk becomes increasingly less expensive \nas technology progresses. \nSensor\
    \ nodes can be interfaced to a number of sensors. The most common include humidity,\
    \ light \nand temperatures sensors. These platforms are built in such a way that\
    \ the sensed data is collected by \nthe sensors, sometimes pre-processed, and\
    \ then transmitted to a sink node via other sensor nodes; \nhence they are usually\
    \ set up in a network, also known as a wireless sensor network (WSN). \nAdditionally,\
    \ these systems will be deployed outdoors and thus have to cope with the harsh\
    \ \nenvironmental conditions. In this context, properties from industrial control\
    \ networks can be applied in \nthese sensor networks for added robustness and\
    \ reliability [25]. \n4.1. Wireless Sensor Networks \nWireless sensor networks\
    \ consist of wireless sensor nodes, which are devices equipped with a \nprocessor,\
    \ a radio interface, an analog-to-digital converter, multiple sensors, memory\
    \ and a power \nsupply. The general architecture of a wireless sensor node is\
    \ illustrated in Figure 2. \nA range of open source sensor nodes are available\
    \ to the research community. Some of the most \nwidely used sensor nodes recently\
    \ in research are Mica, Mica2, IMote, Telos, TelosB, Stargate and \nIMote 2. Table\
    \ 2 contains details on available sensor motes used in research and commercial\
    \ \napplications. The utopia of WSNs is an extremely tiny low-power, low-cost\
    \ sensor node which can be \ndeployed in any environment, with sufficient battery\
    \ power to last for a few years, with the capability \nto continuously sense its\
    \ surroundings. In reality, even with recent advances in microelectronics, these\
    \ \nhave still not been realized. The only project to come close to this idea\
    \ was Smart Dust, which was \nactive up to the early 2000s [26]. \nSensors 2013,\

    \ are characterized by severe resource constraints, one of which is the \nreliance\
    \ on battery life. With the deployment of sensor nodes in very large numbers in\
    \ smart cities, it is \ninfeasible to replace or recharge batteries in these devices.\
    \ Creating energy efficient solutions from \nprotocol design to sophisticated\
    \ power management schemes are efficient and necessary methods, but \nnot sufficient.\
    \ A popular way of supplementing power includes solar panels, but sunlight is\
    \ not always \navailable and it is not the most cost effective solution. The harvesting\
    \ of energy from alternative \nsources in the environment is actively being researched\
    \ and developed. Examples of these energy \nsources include thermal, light (solar),\
    \ wind, mechanical (vibration) and many others. However, \nefficient ways of capturing\
    \ this energy are vital, as the energy from these sources is usually available\
    \ \nin extremely small quantities. \nHence, ways to scavenge energy from the environment\
    \ to prolong the nodes’ lifetimes and improve \nmarket adoption are essential.\
    \ Sources are typically from light, heat and sources of kinetic energy such \n\
    as vibrations, etc. Of course, this technology can also be applied to drive any\
    \ other low-energy device.  \nMethods of energy harvesting, in the context of\
    \ smart cities include: \nWind energy: small scale turbine rotation is converted\
    \ to electrical energy. Such turbines can \nbe located in open places where wind\
    \ is easily accessible. For instance, nodes used for \nstructural health monitoring,\
    \ deployed in bridges and similar structures, can readily use this \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n401 \n \n \nkind of harvesting. Other methods involve the use of piezo-electric\
    \ materials [27] or vibrating \nmembranes [28]. \nRF energy: an antenna receives\
    \ RF signals and an RF-DC converter module converts the RF \nsignals to DC voltages.\
    \ With multiple antennae emitting signals, this type of harvesting is \nworth\
    \ exploring [29]. \nElectric field: electric and magnetic fields around power\
    \ lines, for instance, can be exploited \nfor energy scavenging, as shown in [30,31].\
    \ Sensors deployed in the near proximity of these \noverhead lines can exploit\
    \ these electric or magnetic fields. \nVibrations and movement: kinetic energy,\
    \ from vibrations for instance, can be harvested in \nmany different locations.\
    \ For instance, at utility’s facilities, nodes deployed for condition \nmonitoring\
    \ can exploit vibrations for energy scavenging, as shown in [32]. Vibration is\
    \ probably \nthe most efficient energy sources for scavenging, as well as HVAC\
    \ ducts in office buildings. \nLight and Thermal Sources: these are common both\
    \ indoors and outdoors. In houses for \ninstance, these can be ambient artificial\
    \ light or heat from appliances [33]. \nPiezo-electric harvesters in bridges and\
    \ highways: to meet the demands in power requirements \nfor sensor nodes for SHM,\
    \ the structure’s vibration, in case of bridges or highways, is a good \nenergy\
    \ scavenging source [34]. \nAlthough there is a lot of research and development\
    \ ongoing in this domain, these techniques are \nstill not completely mature for\
    \ powering of low-power devices, and even when they are used, it should \nbe for\
    \ ultra low duty cycles only, to preserve as much energy as possible. Amongst\
    \ these scavenging \ntechniques, harnessing energy from vibration is probably\
    \ the most efficient approach. \n4.2. Internet of Things Systems \nSensor nodes\
    \ described in the previous section, typically send their data to a sink node,\
    \ which in \nturn sends it to some sort of processing centre. These two components\
    \ (sensing and processing) are not \nexplicitly unified, from a WSN perspective.\
    \ Some unified solutions include:  \nThingspeak [35]: Thingspeak is a platform\
    \ which enables users to upload information from \ntheir sensor nodes to the Cloud.\
    \ Users create an account on the platform, register their devices, \nand get access\
    \ to their sensor data as desired. The system allows querying by location, allowing\
    \ \nthe user to have access to data from various locations in the world. \niOBridge\
    \ [36]: in contrast to Thingspeak and Cosm, where libraries for different sensing\
    \ \nplatforms are available, iOBridge develops its own hardware modules that are\
    \ connected to the \nCloud, which in turn can be accessed through web interfaces,\
    \ for remote monitoring and API’s \nallow integration of the collected information\
    \ into other web services or third-party \napplications, for example mobile applications\
    \ for controlling these ioBridge devices remotely \nfrom smartphones such as Android\
    \ and iPhone. \nIn contrast to the systems described above, there are also proprietary\
    \ solutions. These include \nHPCense [37] and Smarter Planet [38]. HPCense’s ultimate\
    \ goal is to deploy more than a trillion \nsensors around the planet to collect\
    \ a range of information such as seismic activity. Smarter Planet is \nan IBM\
    \ initiative which encourages companies to adhere to their solutions to improve\
    \ the efficiency of \nSensors 2013, 13 \n402 \n \n \ntheir current systems. These\
    \ include building management solutions and IT infrastructures for scalable \n\
    data storage. \n4.3. Cloud of Things \nThe Cloud is a vital component of smart\
    \ cities. As sensors collect terabytes of information, this data \nneeds to be\
    \ aggregated and processed. With the recent technological advances in mobile computing,\
    \ in \nthe form of smartphones, the Cloud has become a critical element for data\
    \ storage and processing. In \nsimple terms, the Cloud is a collection of platforms\
    \ and infrastructures on which data is stored and \nprocessed, allowing users\
    \ to retrieve and upload their data for a specific mobile application or \ncomputer\
    \ program, at any location with available Internet access. Hence, the Cloud is\
    \ a pool of \nresources accessible via the Internet. \nThe ability of outsourcing\
    \ processing power is particularly appealing, because resource intensive \napplications\
    \ can be dispatched to the Cloud instead. From the perspective of ubiquitous computing\
    \ and \nsensing, the Cloud is essential. \nFor smart cities, combining the Cloud\
    \ and sensors is crucial, so that the sensing data can be stored \nor processed.\
    \ In [39], a high-level architecture to interface sensors and the Cloud is described.\
    \ The \nexchange of data follows the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard. \n\
    In the context of Cloud computing, all these platforms can be classified as either\
    \ infrastructure as a \nservice (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) or software\
    \ as a service (SaaS). Infrastructure as a service \n(IaaS) consists of providing\
    \ storage or processing capabilities through the use of virtual machines; \nplatform\
    \ as a service (PaaS) comprises a platform with execution environment and databases;\
    \ and \nsoftware as a service (SaaS) provides facilities for users to access their\
    \ applications or personal files on \nthe cloud. The integration of sensor devices\
    \ into the Internet requires IP compatible protocol stacks. \nThe Constrained\
    \ Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application layer protocol, specifically for\
    \ \nenergy constrained devices, described in [40]. The device in question (in\
    \ this context, a sensor node) \ncommunicates with a CoAP client, which in turn\
    \ communicates with a web server. CoAP and \n6LoWPAN allow sensor nodes to be\
    \ integrated into the web, through the use of proxies for HTTP to \nCoAP conversion.\
    \ In this context, if sensor nodes running CoAP are connected to the network,\
    \ sensing \ndata could be retrieved by a web browser through GET requests, in\
    \ the same way a HTTP agent is \nqueried. Figure 3 illustrates how CoAP and HTTP\
    \ co-exist. \nFigure 3. CoAP to HTTP conversion through a proxy in the Cloud.\
    \ \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n403 \n \n \nEfforts are made to integrate these services\
    \ into each layer of the protocol stack, such as in \nSensinode [13], where these\
    \ are combined in the protocol stack. IoT standardizing efforts are also a \n\
    challenge as a large number of companies are involved with IoT development. \n\
    Other standardizing efforts include the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework\
    \ [41], by the \nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC), with the goal of seamlessly\
    \ integrating sensor nodes independent \nof hardware platform, and defining structures\
    \ for describing measured data from sensors to a suite of \nweb services available\
    \ to the platform.  \nWhen using smartphones as ubiquitous sensing tools, standards\
    \ have to put in place for efficient \ndata exchange between devices. In [42]\
    \ a performance analysis on Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) \nprotocols for data exchange\
    \ between mobile devices for environmental monitoring applications is \npresented.\
    \ SWE protocols are based on XML, which introduce a considerable amount of overhead.\
    \ By \nanalyzing the execution speed of the XML parsing process, and comparing\
    \ to alternative formats, such \nas JSON, or EXI, with reductions in the file\
    \ size in the order of 40% to 90%, as well as faster parsing \ntimes, it was concluded\
    \ that EXI-C, even though it adds considerable overhead in processing times, \n\
    results in greatly reduced message lengths. Apart from the integration of sensor\
    \ devices onto the Web, \nanother issue is the large volume of data due the large\
    \ number of sensors. \nAn example of Cloud architecture to solve the high volume\
    \ data issue, named CLEVER, is \npresented in [43]. This architecture allows the\
    \ virtualization of different types of sensing structures so \nthat a common interface\
    \ can be used for multiple sensor networks. It provides services for sensing,\
    \ \nstorage and computation. From a cloud perspective, CLEVER is mainly an IaaS\
    \ solution. A module \nnamed C-SENSOR is responsible for managing the sensors’\
    \ physical resources and abstraction/ \nvirtualization. C-SENSOR is compliant\
    \ with SWE and it interacts with sensor data in an event-based \nor on-demand\
    \ fashion. A Host Manager directly interfaces with the sensor network and a Cluster\
    \ \nManager, which interacts with the system’s front-end and database. Each sensor\
    \ network is virtualized \nas a virtual pervasive element (VPE), which is an integral\
    \ part of the Host manager. \n5. Applications \n5.1. Water Distribution Systems\
    \ \nWater (along with electricity) is one of the most important resources in urban\
    \ areas. From supplying \nresidential customers to public infrastructures, such\
    \ as public parks, the distribution of water has to be \ndone efficiently and\
    \ has to be regulated. Furthermore, efficient quality control has to be performed\
    \ to \nensure that water is safe for human consumption. A typical water distribution\
    \ system consists of a \nwater collecting point (such as a river or lake), storage\
    \ facilities (such as reservoirs) and a distribution \nnetwork, which typically\
    \ consists of pipes (placed either above or underground and underwater) \nconnecting\
    \ water collecting points, storage facilities, to the customers’ premises. \n\
    These distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent. For instance, if there\
    \ is a leak in one of \nthe distribution pipes, it can be tricky to diagnose the\
    \ system early enough to detect the fault, \nespecially if it is not readily visible\
    \ (in case of underground pipes for instance). Advanced sensing \nenables a more\
    \ reliable fault detection system. Possible locations to deploy sensors and parameters\
    \ of \ninterest, from a monitoring perspective, in water distribution systems,\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. Examples \nSensors 2013, 13 \n404 \n \n \nof such applications\
    \ include monitoring the content level in reservoir tanks, leak detection and\
    \ \nmonitoring the water quality at specific points along the distribution system.\
    \ \nFigure 4. Applications of sensing in water distribution systems. \n \nFor\
    \ pipeline monitoring, the method shown in [44] consists of sensors deployed around\
    \ the pipeline \nfor continuous monitoring. Typically, three parameters used to\
    \ indicate faults in pipelines are \nvibration, pressure, sound (made by the liquid\
    \ as it leaks) and water flow [45]. By monitoring these \nparameters, a leakage\
    \ can be successfully detected. In [46], a WSN monitors hydraulic, flow and \n\
    acoustic data, as well as water quality, with nodes deployed at strategic locations\
    \ along the pipeline \nand also in sewers to determine content levels. \nFor pressure\
    \ sensing, this system uses a piezo-resistive sensor and for measuring water pH\
    \  \n(for quality monitoring purposes), a glass electrode is used. For water level\
    \ monitoring, an ultrasonic \nsensor was placed on top of the collector, and two\
    \ pressure transducers were placed at the bottom [45]. \nAdditionally, using dual-axis\
    \ accelerometers, vibration data is collected. These sensors are deployed \nalong\
    \ the pipes as shown in Figure 5. \nFigure 5. Vibration, pressure, and flow sensors\
    \ in a pipeline. These are used to monitor the \nintegrity of the pipeline, as\
    \ described above. \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n405 \n \n \nThe collected data is then\
    \ analyzed to search for leaks. By analyzing the pressure data using Haar \nWavelet\
    \ transforms, pressure pulses along the pipe can be detected to determine whether\
    \ bursts \noccurred and their approximate location. High magnitude noise in the\
    \ acoustic signal is also an \nindication of a leak. Since sensors are typically\
    \ placed apart and by cross-correlating the data collected \nby neighbor nodes,\
    \ and considering time differences due to the sensors’ spatial positioning, the\
    \ \nlocation of a leak can be determined. As these analysis methods require considerable\
    \ processing \nresources, the data collected is analyzed remotely and not locally\
    \ on the sensor nodes. A device to \nmitigate effects from the leak can be activated\
    \ when an anomaly is detected. In the context of pipeline \nmonitoring, this could\
    \ consist of a device that would instruct an electro-mechanical device (i.e.,\
    \ \nactuator) to act in order to restrict the flow of water to sections of the\
    \ pipe which could have been \ncompromised by the leak. Other methods consist\
    \ of placing meters inside the pipe to determine liquid \nflow [47]. \nHence,\
    \ integrated sensing, processing and actuators results in an intelligent structure,\
    \ where the \nactuator’s decisions do not require human intervention. The data\
    \ is collected by the sensing agent, \nanalyzed, classified and an intelligent\
    \ decision is carried out by the actuator. \n5.2. Electricity Distribution Systems\
    \ \nConventional electricity distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent.\
    \ Typically, these energy \ndistribution infrastructures provide unidirectional\
    \ flows, from the generating station to the customers. \nThe amount of supplied\
    \ electricity is estimated or predicted, through previous available data, in order\
    \ \nto perform load shedding for instances where the demand exceeds the supply.\
    \ \nAn improvement to the conventional distribution scheme is a bi-directional\
    \ system, in the sense that \nelectricity flows from the utility to the client’s\
    \ premises and vice versa. A more efficient use of energy \nis then possible,\
    \ whereby electricity can flow back to the utility (to be stored for later use)\
    \ in cases of \nlow demand. These systems are collectively known as smart grids.\
    \ The concept of distributed \ngeneration enables a scenario where, instead of\
    \ having a centralized generation scheme, additional \nelectricity generation\
    \ points can be located closer to customers, therefore reducing the impact of\
    \ losses \non electricity transportation over long distances. Additionally, this\
    \ enables more innovative demand \nresponse programs to be put into action. \n\
    In contrast to conventional power grids, smart grids introduce many improvements.\
    \ Firstly, smart \ngrids have self-monitoring capabilities [48], where sensors\
    \ can be deployed anywhere along the \ndistribution network, in locations such\
    \ as substations or overhead transmission lines, for instance. \nSensor data can\
    \ then be used to report relevant events (in terms of performance and reliability)\
    \ back to \nappropriate entities. An important sensing application in smart grid,\
    \ amongst others, is the monitoring \nof overhead transmission lines. By monitoring\
    \ the lines, utilities ensure that power delivery occurs \nwithin safe limits.\
    \ For instance, systems like STAMP [49] sense the temperature, sag and tension\
    \ \nvalues of an overhead line in real time and determine the state, or health,\
    \ of the line from these \nmeasurements (illustrated in Figure 6). STAMP achieves\
    \ this using a distributed temperature system \n(DTS) and thermocouples for temperature\
    \ measurements, a laser range finder to detect sag and ground \nclearance, and\
    \ two load cells to monitor tension. These parameters have to be carefully monitored\
    \ to \nensure that the conductor is operating at its ampacity rating, which is\
    \ dependent on temperature. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n406 \n \n \nFigure 6. Location\
    \ of current sensors in a transmission line to monitor the line’s state. \n \n\
    Furthermore, parameters such as voltage, current and phase can be determined through\
    \ voltage and \ncurrent sensors, such as medium voltage (MV) sensors [50], placed\
    \ directly on the transmission lines, \nor non-intrusive sensors, which measure\
    \ magnetic field variations. An example of a stick-on, low-cost \nsensor for such\
    \ purposes is proposed in [51], which can be readily deployed in transformers\
    \ and \noverhead conductors. \n5.3. Smart Buildings and Homes \nIn an effort to\
    \ promote green living and sustainability, there are various initiatives to decrease\
    \ \nenergy consumption in buildings. In this context, methods to significantly\
    \ reduce energy consumption \nin buildings are various, from intelligent systems\
    \ to smart design. These are necessary because \nbuildings (especially with the\
    \ easy accessibility to inexpensive electrical appliances or other electronic\
    \ \ndevices such as computers, etc.) consume a very large portion of generated\
    \ electricity. In particular, \nheat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)\
    \ constitutes the largest contributors to increased \nconsumption. Hence, sensing\
    \ is crucial in buildings for appropriate actions to reduce consumption can \n\
    take place. For building automation systems, for instance, before an appropriate\
    \ action can take place \n(which could be dimming lights or switching of air conditioning)\
    \ the state of the environment has to be \nproperly assessed. At the heart of\
    \ household energy sensing are smart meters. Energy sensing \nmeasurements are\
    \ interfaced with a smart meter for accurate consumption reports. Sensing can\
    \ also aid \nin demand prediction. \n5.3.1. Approach to Energy Sensing \nAccurate\
    \ power usage measurement at the load side requires appropriate sensing. Additionally,\
    \ the \nexistence of a bi-directional grid enables the use of smart meters at\
    \ customer premises. Determining \nhow much power electrical appliances and electronic\
    \ devices are utilizing is crucial. To this end, \nsensors can be placed on these\
    \ electrical appliances for accurate measurements. \nThree different approaches\
    \ for energy sensing at the customer’s premises are: distributed direct \nsensing,\
    \ single point sensing and intermediate sensing [52]. With distributed sensing,\
    \ a sensor is placed \non each appliance, which means that although measurements\
    \ will be more accurate, it is an expensive \napproach due to installation and\
    \ maintenance costs. Single-point sensing, in contrast to distributed \nSensors\
    \ 2013, 13 \n407 \n \n \nsensing, measures voltage and current entering a household.\
    \ Although not as accurate as distributed \nsensing, it lowers costs significantly.\
    \ By monitoring raw current and voltage waveforms, and \nsubsequently performing\
    \ feature extraction on these measurements, a classification algorithm can be\
    \ \nused to determine which appliances are on or off, by comparing the measurements\
    \ to existing device \nsignatures. Intermediate sensing falls between direct and\
    \ single-point sensing. For intermediate \nsensing, smart breaker devices are\
    \ installed in a household’s circuit panel to provide a more detailed \nanalysis\
    \ of consumption. Other sensing approaches described in [52] are based on voltage\
    \ signatures, \nwhere voltage noise signatures or current signatures are used\
    \ to classify operation of electrical \nappliances, by observing the spectral\
    \ envelope of the harmonics and comparing these observations to \nexisting templates.\
    \  \n5.3.2. Correlation between Demand Prediction and Weather Conditions  \nThe\
    \ concept of Smart World as an interconnection of smart infrastructures is introduced\
    \ in [53]. \nThis concept includes sensing a range of parameters describing the\
    \ earth’s state, such as environmental \npressure, temperature, radiation and\
    \ similar parameters which can be exploited by the global \ncommunity to improve\
    \ the efficiency of services provided to the community. \nFor instance, accurate\
    \ demand prediction is necessary to avoid rolling blackouts or similar measures\
    \ \nwhen demand exceeds supply. With regard to demand prediction, the correlation\
    \ between weather \n(which is typically characterized by temperature, pressure,\
    \ humidity and wind speed and direction) and \ndemand, or human behavior, is of\
    \ particular interest. In [53], the effect of weather on electricity \nconsumption\
    \ is investigated. It is found that the highest correlation weather variables\
    \ with power \nconsumption are temperature, global solar radiation and humidity\
    \ [53], for different times of the day \nand seasons. The work in [53] specifically\
    \ focuses on smaller areas, such as micro-grids. This is \ncorrelated with the\
    \ usage of appliances, as heaters, geysers and air conditioners tend to comprise\
    \ a \nlarge percentage of a house’s electricity consumption, and the use of these\
    \ appliances is correlated \nwith seasons. By using environmental data and intelligent\
    \ agents to help predict load, it is possible to \nachieve greatly improved demand\
    \ prediction. \n5.3.3. Occupancy and User Context \nThe most basic action when\
    \ it comes to occupancy is to determine whether there are people in a \nroom or\
    \ not. Typically, this can be achieved through a combination of sensors, as shown\
    \ in [54]. These \nsensors include passive-infrared (PIR) sensors [54] or more\
    \ sophisticated camera based methods such \nas the methods shown on [55], where\
    \ people can be actively counted to determine occupancy numbers \nand locations.\
    \ PIR detectors are used in home alarm systems for motion detection (i.e., to\
    \ detect \nwhether there is a person in a room). Apart from occupancy, another\
    \ important feature is the user \ncontext, as highlighted in [56]. This can be\
    \ achieved by behavior activity classification using video \ncameras for instance,\
    \ as shown in [57]. The data from these sources enables an appropriate plan of\
    \ \naction with regards to the people in the room. For instance, lights in corridors,\
    \ elevators, and or other \nfacilities can be dimmed if there is no human activity,\
    \ hence reducing the overall energy consumption. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n408 \n \n\
    \ \n5.3.4. Indoor Monitoring \nOf interest are also the buildings’ ambient temperature\
    \ and ambient lighting. For instance, with \nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) lamps,\
    \ the intensity can be reduced in cases where ambient light, from \nopen windows\
    \ for instance, is sufficient. These windows are made of tintable material which\
    \ reacts to \nchanges in the environment [58], and can reflect or absorb light,\
    \ depending on an external electrical \nstimulus. This is a simple example of\
    \ how energy consumption can be reduced by smart design. \nIndoor temperature\
    \ can also be monitored so that parameters in the HVAC system can be adjusted\
    \ \nto meet specified temperatures, described by predefined set-points. For these\
    \ purposes, humidity and \ntemperature are deployed in strategic positions to\
    \ collect the required data for actuation. \nThe smart thermostat proposed in\
    \ [59] is an example of a combination of sensors and actuators in \nthe smart\
    \ building context. The thermostat is coupled with motion sensors to detect occupancy\
    \ and \nthen creates an optimal setback schedule based on this collected data\
    \ for autonomous operation. \nIn [60] a ZigBee based HVAC control system is described\
    \ for ensuring an adequate comfort level in \nbuildings, using machine learning\
    \ techniques. Sensor nodes are equipped with temperature and \nhumidity sensors,\
    \ from which data is collected at one-minute intervals and sent to a logging system.\
    \ \nThis data is clustered and matched to user feedback, where users can indicate\
    \ their current comfort \nlevel. In the control phase, the control system and\
    \ clusters classified as uncomfortable can be moved to \nthe closest comfortable\
    \ cluster. \nApart from monitoring and controlling HVAC systems, it is also necessary\
    \ to monitor electrical \nappliances, to detect any faults and to be able to assess\
    \ current operating status remotely, and having \nthe appliances wirelessly connected\
    \ to each other in a home area network (HAN). Furthermore, these \nsystems can\
    \ be connected to social networks to share notifications, enabling remote monitoring.\
    \ An \nexample of such a system is described in [61]. All appliances have a set\
    \ of sensors (to measure \nhumidity, temperature or pressure) mounted on them,\
    \ which are connected to a local sensor host \n(LSH), and are equipped with 802.3\
    \ u and 802.11 g interfaces, so that these nodes can be connected to \nan available\
    \ wired or wireless network, which is connected to the Internet. Each appliance\
    \ is fitted \nwith a specific set of sensor types. For instance, a refrigerator\
    \ can be fitted with pressure and acoustic \nsensors on each tray to determine\
    \ the quantity of food. Examples of notifications from appliances \ninclude warnings\
    \ from washing machines upon completion of a washing cycle. \n5.3.5. Smart Building\
    \ Evacuation \nAnother aspect of smart buildings is smart evacuation systems.\
    \ Conventional evacuation systems \nactivate an alarm when an alert for an emergency\
    \ situation is triggered. This model assumes that \npeople within the building\
    \ are aware of the routes to exit the building. A more efficient way to perform\
    \ \nbuilding evacuation is to count the number of people and direct them through\
    \ the quickest routes by \nconsidering congestion information, obtainable from\
    \ a variety of sensors, such as beam sensors or \nvideo cameras. Examples of such\
    \ WSNs are described in [62] and [63], using beam sensors and \ndetection of tags\
    \ worn by the people in the building, respectively. Although not as accurate,\
    \ these \nmethods are preferable to video camera based methods, from a processing\
    \ cost perspective. Instead of \nusing these systems stand-alone, they can be\
    \ interfaced to the building’s infrastructure, to obtain an \nSensors 2013, 13\
    \ \n409 \n \n \nestimate of the number of people through existing occupancy and\
    \ user context functionality, typically \nbased on motion sensors or video cameras,\
    \ if available. \n5.4. Monitoring Bridges and Seismic Activity \nAll public infrastructures\
    \ have to be monitored to assess their condition. Even if these \ninfrastructures\
    \ are monitored by personnel through scheduled visits, a visual inspection is\
    \ often not \nsufficient, as anomalies may still go undetected. A more efficient\
    \ approach to monitoring is to install a \nvariety of sensors across the structure\
    \ to continuously monitor its state and determine its health. \nThere are a variety\
    \ of parameters which characterize a structure’s state. In [64], the most common\
    \ \nparameters for monitoring of structures are listed as chemical (pH, oxidation,\
    \ and corrosion), \nmechanical (strain, stress and deformation) and physical (temperature\
    \ and humidity). A variety of \nsensors capable of measuring these parameters\
    \ can be deployed in large numbers across a structure for \naccurate monitoring,\
    \ but these can incur a significantly high cost. Recently, fiber optic sensing\
    \ (FOS) \nhas received substantial attention from the research community. \nRecent\
    \ approaches for SHM include using sophisticated fiber optic sensors [65]. In\
    \ bridges, for \ndamage detection, optic fiber sensors can be used for structure\
    \ monitoring. An optic fiber sensor works \nby detecting the change in the detected\
    \ signal from a transmitted signal, after it has passed through the \nstructure\
    \ of interest, and is able to measure strain, pressure and temperature, by interpreting\
    \ changes in \nwavelength. This typically requires the installation of fiber into\
    \ the structure to be monitored. These \ndistributed sensors work on the basis\
    \ of back-scattering. As light propagates through the fiber, some of \nit is scattered\
    \ back along the length of the fiber. Since the properties of the back-scattered\
    \ light depend \non the strain, deformation or temperature of the fiber, by using\
    \ this information one can determine the \nstate of the structure where the fiber\
    \ is installed. A fiber distributed sensor is equivalent to having a \nlarge number\
    \ of sensors deployed along a line with high resolution, since all points along\
    \ the fiber can \nbe considered sensing points, as described in [66]. Other approaches\
    \ to sensing for SHM use WSNs \nwith sensor nodes equipped with multiple accelerometers\
    \ to sense vibration along a 1,300 m long \nbridge [67]. The appeal of these systems\
    \ is the relatively low cost and ease of installation in \ncomparison to more\
    \ sophisticated sensing solutions. These sensors were deployed over the main span\
    \ \nand tower, and collected information of structural accelerations from wind\
    \ load. Additional approaches \ninclude the use of thermal responses and combination\
    \ of multiple sensors such as strain gauges,  \nstrain-gage displacement and force\
    \ sensors, as well as non-intrusive sensing methods using video \ncameras [68].\
    \ These computer vision based systems can be used for instance for structural\
    \ crack \ndetection [69]. \nAnother important application of sensor networks in\
    \ smart cities is monitoring the ground to detect \nany anomalies. These allow\
    \ early detection of earthquakes or landslides, which can be used for early \n\
    warnings in emergency situations. In [70] a wireless sensor network is suggested\
    \ to monitor sub-soil \nactivity. Sensor nodes are buried underground. In contrast\
    \ to other monitoring techniques, which rely \non sensors attached to the sensor\
    \ node, the technique proposed in [70] relies on how the propagation \nsignal\
    \ is affected by soil conditions. By considering changes in the received signal\
    \ strength (RSS), it is \npossible to infer events based on how each soil parameter\
    \ affects the signal. In particular, water \nintrusion, detection of relative\
    \ motion and relative density change can be detected using this technique. \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n410 \n \n \n5.5. Environmental Monitoring \nTo ensure quality\
    \ of life, as well as safety, environmental monitoring is of utmost importance.\
    \ By \nmonitoring the quality of air, quality of water, and other parameters such\
    \ as humidity, temperature and \nambient carbon dioxide level, as well as other\
    \ harmful gases, it is possible to assess anomalies in the \nenvironment; therefore\
    \ ensuring pollution is kept to an acceptable level. In particular, reducing the\
    \ \nlevel of carbon emissions, which is a serious threat to our planet is one\
    \ of the main goals of smart \ncities. Environmental monitoring requires deploying\
    \ a variety of sensors outdoors, in locations such as \nparks and rivers, etc.\
    \ With the proliferation of smartphones, it is possible to use them for collaborative\
    \ \nenvironment monitoring. Furthermore, it is necessary to better understand\
    \ how human behavior is \ninfluenced by weather conditions, with regards to mobility\
    \ and other aspects. \nIn [71], the relationship between human behavior and weather\
    \ is studied, in an attempt to gain a \nbetter understanding of the dynamics of\
    \ an urban system. Data characterizing air quality and weather \nwas collected\
    \ from environmental monitoring stations and analyzed in conjunction with network\
    \ \nmobile traffic data generated during a period of 20 days. It was demonstrated\
    \ that by combining data \nfrom different ubiquitous sensing sources (environmental\
    \ data and mobile traffic data), it is possible to \nanalyze environmental and\
    \ social dynamics, which can be used to improve on a lot of aspects in the \n\
    context of smart cities, such as public transportation and other services. \n\
    5.6. Intelligent Transportation Systems \nWith the steep increase in car numbers\
    \ over recent years, there is an increasing need for efficient \ntraffic management,\
    \ to avoid traffic jams and optimize traffic flow, especially at intersections.\
    \ A \nconventional way to regulate traffic flow is through the use of traffic\
    \ lights. These typically have fixed \nswitch interval times (i.e., from red to\
    \ green and to yellow), which are not adjustable to traffic \nconditions. Traffic\
    \ jams have significant impacts on fuel consumption due to the frequent starts\
    \ and \nstops, as well as increased carbon emissions. An adaptive scheme, dependent\
    \ on traffic conditions, is \nmore attractive. In this context, a method to estimate\
    \ the number of cars approaching an intersection \ncould generate information\
    \ for switch interval times to be dynamically adjusted based on traffic \nconditions.\
    \ For such an intelligent system to be realized, efficient methods to detect traffic\
    \ (i.e., count \nthe number of cars) are required. Approaches where traffic lights\
    \ and stop signs are completely \nremoved have also been proposed, as described\
    \ in [72]. Such an approach is based on an intelligent \nintersection where vehicles,\
    \ which are wirelessly connected to each other, can communicate with each \nother\
    \ and use decision-making for collision avoidance. Using a time-slot for each\
    \ vehicle, crossing of \nintersections is coordinated amongst vehicles [73]. A\
    \ vehicle which misses its time-slot has to stop \nwhen it reaches the intersection\
    \ and wait for a new time-slot. The wireless communication can be \nperformed\
    \ through RFID, as proposed in [74]. In [74] a system to control a vehicle’s speed\
    \ \nautonomously based on the traffic signs is described. RFID was used for communication\
    \ between the \nvehicle and traffic signs, with RFID tags placed on traffic signs\
    \ and RFID readers placed on the side of \nthe doors of the car, and a Hall Effect\
    \ sensor placed on the vehicle’s wheels for speed control. \nInexpensive methods\
    \ of sensing cars involve induction loop detectors which are buried in roads.\
    \ \nLoops detectors can be used to detect the presence of metals. When a vehicle\
    \ approaches the loop, the \nSensors 2013, 13 \n411 \n \n \nloop’s resonant frequency\
    \ increases, and this change in frequency is interpreted as a vehicle. The \n\
    increase in frequency differs according to car size (or height), enabling an estimate\
    \ of the kind of car \nwhich has been sensed. This information can then be used\
    \ to estimate vehicle speed or other \nparameters, which can be useful for traffic\
    \ flow management. To estimate a vehicle’s weight, other \nmethods such as weight\
    \ in motion (WIM) can be used. A WIM system captures vehicle gross and axle \n\
    weights using sensor mats on road surfaces. Various types of WIM systems are discussed\
    \ in [75]: \npiezoelectric systems (which detect changes in voltage due to pressure);\
    \ capacitive mats (two inductive \nloops and one capacitive weight sensor); bending\
    \ plates (which record the strain on the plate due to the \ndynamic load of the\
    \ vehicle); load cells (which use a single load cell with two scales for each\
    \ side of \nthe vehicle’s axle); and optical WIM (where pressure on the optical\
    \ fiber creates a phase shift in \npolarization modes which is directly related\
    \ to the load on the fiber). All methods highlighted above \nusually carry significant\
    \ installation and maintenance costs. A WIM system is illustrated in Figure 7.\
    \ \nLess intrusive (but not as accurate) and more sophisticated methods involve\
    \ video cameras. These \napproaches are more attractive mainly because cameras\
    \ can be easily installed and the level of required \nmaintenance is low, compared\
    \ to previously described approaches. Furthermore, in instances where \nthere\
    \ are surveillance cameras installed, these can be used for intelligent transportation\
    \ applications. A \nwireless real-time traffic monitoring system is proposed in\
    \ [76]. The system consists of multiple \nstandard CCTV cameras and personal computers\
    \ (PCs), which process the captured data from the \ncameras. Each camera is controlled\
    \ by the PCs, and each PC implements all the necessary algorithms \nfor recognition\
    \ and tracking. \nThe system was tested in different environments, such as airports\
    \ and tunnels. One of the \ndrawbacks of computer vision-based methods is their\
    \ performance dependency on environment \nconditions, such as lighting and occlusions.\
    \ Dealing with occlusions or weather conditions is \nchallenging in computer vision,\
    \ so such scenarios have to be handled with care. For instance, in the \npresence\
    \ of fog or rain, vehicle detection or counting is more challenging. For night-time\
    \ scenarios, \nstreet lamps and vehicle lights also have to be considered [77].\
    \ In particular, street lamps, traffic lights \ncan be used for vehicle sensing,\
    \ as vehicles can be detected by considering the distance between \nvehicle’s\
    \ headlights. \nFigure 7. Weight in motion system. Weight information recorded\
    \ by the weight detectors \nis sent to the controller via wired connectors, such\
    \ as a fiber optic cable, for storage  \nand processing. \n \nSensors 2013, 13\
    \ \n412 \n \n \n5.7. Surveillance \nWith the availably of conventional CCTV systems\
    \ for surveillance purposes, an infrastructure for \nsmart surveillance systems\
    \ already exists. Security, especially in urban areas, is of paramount \nimportance.\
    \ Although these cameras are typically connected to a digital video recorder (DVR),\
    \ most \nonly record and do not have any built-in intelligent processing capabilities.\
    \ Furthermore, these systems \nare run by human operators who are prone to loss\
    \ of concentration. The benefits of using smart \nsurveillance are obvious. For\
    \ instance, by monitoring peoples’ actions, it is possible to determine \nwhether\
    \ violent actions are taking place, and even trying to identify and recognize\
    \ the people involved. \nIn this context, smart surveillance systems could alert\
    \ users by triggering alerts when events of \ninterest take place. Additionally,\
    \ monitoring people’s behavior can help in determining pedestrian \ntraffic patterns\
    \ which can be of help in the design of future pedestrian facilities or modification\
    \ of \ncurrent facilities. \nIn the instance of gatherings, it is important to\
    \ have crowd control schemes in place, especially in \ncases where there are large\
    \ numbers of people, such as in concerts, or other public areas such as \nairports.\
    \ This is especially relevant in emergency management systems or pedestrian crowd\
    \ \nmonitoring, especially at night-time. To track and detect pedestrians at night,\
    \ an infrared video can be \nused [78], as infrared cameras work on the basis\
    \ of temperature and not on reflected light, hence \ninfrared based computer vision\
    \ techniques are less susceptible to lighting. \nAnother important aspect of crowd\
    \ surveillance, especially in security applications, is to determine \nwhether\
    \ people are carrying any objects, such as suitcases, etc. This allows determining\
    \ whether a \nperson, for instance, is entering a restricted area while carrying\
    \ an object which they are not allowed \ncarrying in specific facilities. A framework\
    \ to detect objects carried by people from video sequences is \npresented in [79].\
    \ This method works by considering irregularities in a person’s silhouette. This\
    \ is \nperformed by comparing a template of an individual walking in the same\
    \ direction as the individual \nbeing observed, with any protrusions noticed considered\
    \ as possible pixels for carrying objects. \nAnother important aspect of crowd\
    \ control is determining violent behavior. Monitoring of fights, \nriots and similar\
    \ events is important for safety reasons. A crowd behavior classification algorithm\
    \ is \nproposed in [80]. \nA semantic video surveillance system able to autonomously\
    \ detect abnormal situations, able to run \non low resolution (320 × 240) cameras\
    \ is described in [81]. The system’s cameras run motion \ndetection algorithms\
    \ with are used to extract information from the video and format it in XML, \n\
    aggregating several frames, which are then used to perform route detection, which\
    \ consists of \nextracting information of objects which enter or exit the scene.\
    \ Finally, a semantic reasoning module is \nused to classify the semantic data\
    \ obtained from semantic translation to determine whether there are \nanomalies\
    \ such as cars driving on the sidewalks or similar situations which could indicate\
    \ abnormal \nsituations. This system can be used to detect pedestrians crossing\
    \ streets without using crosswalks or \nwalking on railways and vehicles going\
    \ in the wrong direction. Hence, this system can be deployed in \ndifferent scenarios\
    \ only changing its rules’ set to fit that specific environment. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n413 \n \n \n5.8. Public Services—Law Enforcement and Fire Fighting \nThe\
    \ conventional law enforcement model is impractical and inefficient. Investigations\
    \ and other \nprocesses within law enforcement are aggravated by human incompetency\
    \ and lack of automation in \nprocesses. For law enforcement, IBM has solutions\
    \ within the Smarter Planet initiative, integrating \ninvestigations, geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS) and intelligence analysis [82], enabling \ninformation\
    \ sharing across agencies, resulting in a more efficient and more coordinated\
    \ law \nenforcement scheme. Another public service that can be improved by use\
    \ of technology is  \nfire-fighting. Fire fighters risk their lives in the line\
    \ of duty, due to the harsh conditions in which they \nhave to carry out their\
    \ work. \nConventional fire-fighting can also be improved, as shown in [83]. This\
    \ system consists of a TelosB \nbased wireless sensor network, where the nodes\
    \ are placed on firefighters’ bodies. Each TelosB mote \nis equipped with sensors\
    \ to measure temperature, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen and hydrocarbon \nconcentration.\
    \ Using RSSI based localization, firefighters are aware of their position relative\
    \ to other \nfighters within the network. This also enables computation of escape\
    \ paths, so that firefighters can exit \nthe work location safely. \n5.9. Health\
    \ Care \nOne of the most important applications of sensor networks is in healthcare.\
    \ To facilitate \nmanagement in hospitals or clinics, sensors can be used in these\
    \ environments for various applications. \nIn particular, wireless body area networks\
    \ (WBANs), is a very active research field. Body area \nnetworks consist of inter-connected\
    \ sensors placed in different parts of the human body. Hence, with \nsensors attached\
    \ to one’s body, either internally or externally, it is possible to monitor an\
    \ individual’s \nvital signs remotely. Examples of parameters which can be monitored\
    \ include electrocardiography \n(ECG), respiration, skin conductance and skin\
    \ temperature [84]. The advantage of WBANs is their \ncapability to upload this\
    \ data to remote logging systems so that the collected data can be viewed by a\
    \ \nmedical practitioner in real-time. Individuals with heart problems, for instance,\
    \ can be constantly \nmonitored and alerted if there are signs of an anomaly.\
    \ Activity monitoring and classification, which is \nuseful in health monitoring,\
    \ can also be performed by WBANs. But healthcare applications using \nsensing\
    \ technology are not limited to WBANs. \nOther examples of sensing applications\
    \ in healthcare involve emergency response [85]. In [85], a \nprotocol for emergency\
    \ reporting using cognitive wireless sensor networks is proposed. This protocol\
    \ \nis modeled after ants’ behavior and is used to coordinate cluster-heads actions\
    \ more efficiently, which \nresults in a decrease in reporting time delays. \n\
    A framework for long-term activity monitoring is proposed in [86]. The system\
    \ is able to recognize \nuser activity in real time and classifying activities,\
    \ using an array of sensors deployed in the home \nenvironment and attached to\
    \ doors, refrigerators and cupboards, as well as light sensors. From activity\
    \ \nclassification, it is possible to infer whether the person has a certain disease\
    \ or not. For instance, if \nfrequent sleep is detected, it is possibly due to\
    \ fatigue, which could indicate that an individual has \ndiabetes, for instance.\
    \ This framework can be used for disease prediction based on day-to-day activities.\
    \ \nSensors 2013, 13 \n414 \n \n \nA user-context recognition system is presented\
    \ in [87]. It uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to \nassess users’ stress levels.\
    \ Users insert their stress levels into a questionnaire through a smartphone \n\
    application. The entered data is matched to smartphone’s context data, such as\
    \ location and activity \ninformation, which is then used for HMM training. Stress\
    \ levels can then be classified after the \ntraining phase. \n5.10. Crowd Sourcing\
    \ \nCrowd sourcing consists of outsourcing tasks to a group of people, or crowd,\
    \ in an attempt to \ncollaboratively completing tasks quickly. The smart city\
    \ not only consists of smart infrastructure and \nsustainability: smart people\
    \ are also an integral part of the smart city. With the recent proliferation of\
    \ \nsocial platforms and mobile computing, crowd sourcing becomes a viable medium\
    \ for exchange of \nskills and services. Workflows, in crowd sourcing, consist\
    \ of tasks which have been unified. For crowd \nsourcing to be effectively carried\
    \ out, workflow processes have to be designed so that jobs can be \nbroken into\
    \ tasks and efficiently dispatched to human actors, and these workflow processes\
    \ have to be \nideally integrated into social platforms. To this end, various\
    \ tools have been developed. In [88], a \ncollaborative workflow tool for Amazon\
    \ Mechanical Turk is described. It allows requesters to view \ntasks’ current\
    \ status and reduces required planning by requesters. CrowdScape [89] attempts\
    \ to include \nuser behavior into the crowd sourcing process, in an attempt to\
    \ improve work efficiency. User \nbehavior whilst completing a task is considered\
    \ in conjunction with worker outputs, using machine \nlearning. Actions considered\
    \ to characterize user’s behavior include frequency of mouse click events, \n\
    key presses and scrolls. By correlating the user behavior with good work outputs,\
    \ it is possible to \nidentify traits of good workers, helping make crowd sourcing\
    \ task assignments more efficient. \nWith smartphones becoming increasingly more\
    \ powerful in terms of resources, crowd sourcing \nusing smartphones phones has\
    \ been thoroughly investigated. For instance, as users regularly update \ntheir\
    \ location status on social networks like Twitter and Facebook, based on this\
    \ location information, \nit is possible to aggregate this data, enabling tasks\
    \ to be dispatched to people in specific locations. \nFurthermore, by using sensor\
    \ data on a smartphone, it is possible to determine a person’s state (i.e., \n\
    whether the user is stationary or not), as well as environment. This data can\
    \ be collaboratively used to \nobtain information regarding the weather with location\
    \ information [90]. \nGiven the number of smartphones users in the world, this\
    \ enables pervasive sensing. With \nsmartphones fitted with a variety of sensors\
    \ such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses, \nsmartphones enable\
    \ a variety of crowd sourcing applications, which will be eventually augmented\
    \ by \nthe Internet of Things. In particular, collaborative data collection is\
    \ a popular crowd sourcing application.  \nExamples include MobSens [91], which\
    \ combines four applications: PollutionSpy to monitor air \npollution; NoiseSpy\
    \ which captures noise levels; MobAsthma, a personalized asthma monitoring \n\
    application; and Fresh, an application which provides a platform to let users\
    \ discuss issues regarding \ntheir environment. \nAlthough crowd sourcing is typically\
    \ outsourcing work tasks to people, crowd sourcing can also be \nused for sensing,\
    \ as described in [92]. Crowd reporting, as described in [92], consists of collecting\
    \ \ninformation from sources such as mobile devices and social networks. The data\
    \ reported can be in the \nform of messages which are aggregated and converted\
    \ into a uniform format, for processing. The data \nSensors 2013, 13 \n415 \n\
    \ \n \nis collected from Twitter as using a set of keywords to select relevant\
    \ information. This data is then \npre-processed, filtered and clustered so that\
    \ event correlation can be determined. \nAlthough sensing through crowd sourcing\
    \ (i.e., pervasive sensing) is appealing to a number of \npromising applications,\
    \ there are still a number of challenges, which are not necessarily of a  \ntechnical\
    \ nature. Privacy, in particular, is possibly the biggest challenge. Additionally,\
    \ involving the \nnot-so-evident risks related to large-scale data collection\
    \ as well as legal issues such as data ownership, \nuser protection [93] and trust\
    \ needs to be insured as entities responsible for analyzing the collected \ndata,\
    \ can abuse the collected information or use it to harm the user. \n5.11. Summary\
    \ of Benefits of Smart Sensing \nFrom the content presented in this section, it\
    \ is evident that advanced sensing applications in cities \nenable improvement\
    \ in process efficiency. Based on this information, Table 3 summarizes some of\

    \ \nThe concept of a smart city as a system that is highly intelligent and autonomous\
    \ is far from being \nrealized. Even with recent breakthroughs in technology,\
    \ available technology is still not sufficiently \nmature for smart cities to\
    \ be truly autonomous. Nevertheless, there are currently pilot projects of smart\
    \ \ncities in development worth mentioning. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n416 \n \n \n\
    Development for Songdo [94], a fully ubiquitous 1,500 acre city in South Korea,\
    \ started in 2001 \nand is predicted to be complete by 2015. Smart systems in\
    \ every building are used to monitor the water \nand electricity, which also allow\
    \ residents to connect remotely using their smartphones. Sensing \ntechnologies\
    \ include RFID tags on vehicles, which send signals to sensors on the road to\
    \ monitor \ntraffic flow, surveillance systems as well as smart street lights,\
    \ which can be adjusted to pedestrian \ntraffic. Some of the innovative technologies\
    \ in Songdo [95] include home and building automation \nwhere users will be able\
    \ to control the systems in their houses remotely. Ubiquitous sensors are \ndeployed\
    \ virtually everywhere, from buildings, (for safety purposes, for fire, etc.)\
    \ to flow sensors, \nwhich control the canal in Songdo’s Central Park, and on\
    \ street lights to adjust the level of  \nlighting according to the pedestrians’\
    \ flow. Smart power in Songdo is generated by natural gas and \ndistributed through\
    \ a smart grid. Tele-presence facilities are being installed in homes, hospitals\
    \ and \nshopping centers. \nPlanIT Valley [96] in Northern Portugal is another\
    \ pilot project for a fully ubiquitous city built from \nthe ground up, which\
    \ will accommodate 225,000 residents once it is completed. Completion is \nscheduled\
    \ for 2015. Ultimately, PlanIT has a goal of having 100,000,000 sensors deployed.\
    \ \nFujisawa Sustainable Smart Town (SST) [97] in Japan is also another project\
    \ which is currently \nunder development. Fujisawa is scheduled to be completed\
    \ by 2014 and fully inhabited by 2018, and \ndevelopment has started in September\
    \ 2012. It is being developed on 19 ha of land, with the goal of \naccommodating\
    \ 1,000 residents. Targets of 70% reduction of carbon emission are planned. \n\
    Amsterdam, unlike the previously mentioned fully ubiquitous cities which are being\
    \ built from \nscratch, has seen some recent developments en route to make it\
    \ a smart city. The main driver of this \ndevelopment is Amsterdam Smart City\
    \ project [98], which started in 2009, with the main goal of \nincreasing green\
    \ growth using technology. Currently, there are various initiatives within the\
    \ scope of \nAmsterdam Smart City; these services are tested in specific city\
    \ locations, such as IJburb. It includes \ninnovations such as West Orange (a\
    \ residential energy management system, which is able to let users \nknow about\
    \ their energy consumption on a per appliance basis) and a smart grid initiative\
    \ in Nieuw \nWest which services about 10,000 households. In Groningen, there\
    \ is a pilot project aiming to develop \na system which will use GPS data for\
    \ real time information of bus locations, readily available to users’ \nmobile\
    \ phones through a downloadable application [99]. \nThe city council of Norfolk\
    \ has also pilot projects which aim to make data services delivery to \ncitizens\
    \ more efficient, through the improvement of their data collection and data analysis,\
    \ to \nultimately gain improved customer insight [100]. This project also aims\
    \ to develop schemes of \ndelivering data to groups of users through localized\
    \ and personalized web services, based on users’ \ngeographical location. \nAnother\
    \ pilot project which has recently received significant attention is in Santander\
    \ [101]. This is \ncollaboration between academia and industry players which aims\
    \ to conduct IoT research in available \nlarge scale test-beds. Currently, various\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed in the city. A backbone provides the \narchitecture\
    \ necessary for all communication between these sensor nodes.  \nExamples of applications\
    \ enabled by sensor networks in Smart Santander include traffic \nmanagement,\
    \ irrigation optimization for parks and gardens, augmented reality and waste management.\
    \ \nEventually, it is envisaged that 12,000 sensors and actuators will be deployed\
    \ throughout the city by \n2013. Currently, there are approximately 2,000 nodes\
    \ deployed. Examples of implemented trial \nSensors 2013, 13 \n417 \n \n \napplications\
    \ include outdoor parking area management, real time monitoring of light, temperature\
    \ and \nenvironmental noise, as well as participatory sensing using sensors in\
    \ mobile phones. \nIn Barcelona, there are also important initiatives [102]. As\
    \ part of this initiative, for instance, \nsensors have been deployed in garbage\
    \ bins. Firstly, these allow remote monitoring of the content of \nbins, which\
    \ enable the development of an improved garbage collection system, therefore optimizing\
    \ \ngarbage collection services. Additionally, built-in sensors monitor the content\
    \ type in bins and smart \nhumidity sensors enable an automated intelligent water\
    \ use for public park irrigation. Panels \nstrategically placed announce free\
    \ parking places, saving residents’ time in locating parking spots. \nSensors\
    \ on streetlights detect presence and adjust the light intensity accordingly as\
    \ well. \nIn Malaga, another smart city initiative in Spain, smart city initiatives\
    \ aim to achieve a reduction of \nmore than 6,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually\
    \ [103]. To this end, Malaga has invested significantly \nin the city infrastructure,\
    \ including investments in a fiber optic network, municipal Wi-Fi networks and\
    \ \ngeographic information systems for the virtualization of urban indicators.\
    \ The current deployment \nincludes more than 17,000 deployed smart meters. \n\
    Vienna is another city with a number of initiatives from the smart city perspective.\
    \ The main \ninitiatives in Vienna deal primarily with energy efficiency, carbon\
    \ footprint reduction and climate \nprotection [104]. A large number of projects\
    \ are currently underway in Vienna. Table 4 summarizes \nthe goals of the cities\
    \ discussed in this section. \nTable 4. Current smart city pilot projects. \n\

    There are various challenges related to sensing in smart cities, both of a technical\
    \ and social nature. \nSome of these challenges are: \nAddressing and coordination\
    \ issues between sensor nodes: when nodes are deployed in \nmillions, how can\
    \ they be efficiently managed? Although 6LoWPAN enables IPv6 addressing \nsupport\
    \ on IEEE 802.15.4, efficient coordination (in terms of routing, for instance)\
    \ between \nsuch a high number of devices is a big challenge. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n418 \n \n \nSecurity: enabling technologies for sensing applications have\
    \ a number of issues which have  \nto be considered within the context of smart\
    \ cities. These networks will be prone to  \ncyber-terrorism and cyber-vandalism.\
    \ Some of these issues are highlighted in [105] and [106]. \nData ownership and\
    \ privacy: who will own the rights for all data collected by these sensing \n\
    applications? For instance, if the electricity utility has access to an individual’s\
    \ energy \nconsumption data, can that data be used without one’s consent? \nTrust:\
    \ can individuals trust the entities responsible for aggregating and storing their\
    \ data? For \ninstance, the Cloud can be considered a central information system\
    \ where access to data is \ntypically controlled by the company which owns the\
    \ infrastructure. Can these companies  \nbe trusted? \nSocial Issues: residents\
    \ have always been actively involved in a city. For instance, there are \ncollaborative\
    \ initiatives where people come together and help keeping the city clean by \n\
    promoting no littering, etc. Will smart cities (with all the automated processes\
    \ and sophisticated \ntechnology), create some sort of disconnect between the\
    \ people and the city? Then there is the \nissue of education as well. Is the\
    \ average person educated enough to use and understand all \nthese systems? \n\
    Centralized control: it is evident from the content of this paper that we are\
    \ moving towards a \ncentralized control scheme, where all services are being\
    \ progressively aggregated, to be \nmanaged by one huge central system. This translates\
    \ to complete control by the governing \nbodies, which can be used to illegally\
    \ track people or invade someone’s privacy. This is related \nto the trust and\
    \ privacy issues previously mentioned. \nCosts incurred in upgrading current cities:\
    \ how expensive will it be to upgrade current cities \nto make them smart cities?\
    \ As smart cities are heavily dependent on communication and other \ninfrastructures,\
    \ it will certainly be very expensive to update all the current systems. \nThe\
    \ reader is referred to [48], where the authors discuss the major technical challenges\
    \ of WSNs in \nsmart-grid applications. \n8. Conclusions \nIn this paper, the\
    \ role of advanced sensing in smart cities was discussed. An array of applications\
    \ in \nsmart cities which can benefit from advanced sensing were described. These\
    \ include infrastructure \nhealth monitoring, electricity and water distribution\
    \ systems, transportation systems and surveillance, \namongst others. The state\
    \ of the art in each of the considered applications is reviewed and inherent \n\
    challenges are highlighted. In a world where carbon emissions have to be reduced\
    \ for greener living \nand sustainability is promoted, there are a still a lot\
    \ of challenges to be resolved. \nIt is evident that the evolution of technology\
    \ will play a major role in advanced sensing, as the \nevolution of hardware required\
    \ for sensing applications will certainly be driven by these technological \n\
    advances. Even though there are pilot projects for smart cities, there are various\
    \ challenges. These \nchallenges require a holistic approach for solving, which\
    \ will involve multi-disciplinary collaborations. \nFor instance, standardization\
    \ efforts should consider all involved parties, such as municipalities, \nutilities\
    \ and other services providers so that unified solutions in terms of sensing and\
    \ communication \ninfrastructures are put in place. It will be inefficient to\
    \ have separate infrastructures (in terms of \nSensors 2013, 13 \n419 \n \n \n\
    sensing platforms), but it will also be challenging to unify these services under\
    \ a single infrastructure \n(i.e., have the same network on the water distribution\
    \ system as well as the electricity system). \nFurthermore, non-technical challenges\
    \ regarding social issues, like education, also need to be \nconsidered. In the\
    \ context of smart city, it is expected that people will have a certain level\
    \ of skill to \nunderstand these systems and be able to use them. For instance,\
    \ the innovative solution brought about \nby advances in sensing technologies,\
    \ such as improved demand prediction and smart metering, result \nin a more efficient\
    \ electricity distribution system, where the customer also plays a role, by adhering\
    \ to \nincentive programs. But to what extent does the customer want to be really\
    \ involved? Some \nindividuals might not even take advantage of such services.\
    \ These factors should be taken into \nconsideration before services are implemented.\
    \ \nAlthough there are already existing systems and initiatives for smart cities,\
    \ the infrastructure to \nimplement a fully ubiquitous city will be costly. Furthermore,\
    \ the cost of restructuring existing cities to \nfit the fully ubiquitous city\
    \ model will incur much higher costs. \nThe first pilot projects mentioned in\
    \ this paper will serve as a model for fully ubiquitous cities to be \nimplemented\
    \ in future, and will provide insights into additional challenges in the realization\
    \ of smart \ncities. Still, there are numerous challenges to be solved before\
    \ fully ubiquitous cities become a reality. \nAcknowledgment \nThe research was\

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\

    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\

    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\
    \ research in agricultural applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n17 of 45\nTable\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\

    \ [132]. This information can be transmuted to the cloud\ncomputing via gateway\
    \ for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\nReference\
    \ [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node implemented\
    \ for PA\napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were soil moisture,\
    \ temperature, humidity, and\nwind direction and speed sensors to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket”\nplatform was selected for\
    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

  analysis: 'The paper''s focus is on a comprehensive overview of the literature on
    the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The specific aspect it contributes
    to addressing is different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature,
    weather) and their collection and use. The authors acknowledge that most IoT applications
    rely on sensors, and they provide a detailed overview of the different types of
    sensors used in IoT applications, including environmental, medical, neural, chemical,
    infrared, mobile phone sensors, RFID, and actuators. They also discuss related
    work in data preprocessing. Furthermore, the authors analyze communication technologies,
    protocols, and standards used in the IoT context and highlight challenges and
    solutions related to real-time data transmission.


    One limitation of the paper is that it does not provide a quantitative analysis
    or comparison of different IoT technologies and protocols. Additionally, the authors
    do not cover specific security or privacy considerations related to IoT applications,
    which are crucial aspects of IoT system design.'

    \ with each other to serve a meaningful purpose. In this paper, we survey state-of-the-art\
    \ methods, protocols, and\napplications in this new emerging area. This survey\
    \ paper proposes a novel taxonomy for IoT technologies, highlights some of\nthe\
    \ most important technologies, and profiles some applications that have the potential\
    \ to make a striking difference in human\nlife, especially for the differently\
    \ abled and the elderly. As compared to similar survey papers in the area, this\
    \ paper is far more\ncomprehensive in its coverage and exhaustively covers most\
    \ major technologies spanning from sensors to applications.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Today the Internet has become ubiquitous, has touched\nalmost every corner of\
    \ the globe, and is affecting human life in\nunimaginable ways. However, the journey\
    \ is far from over. We\nare now entering an era of even more pervasive connectivity\n\
    where a very wide variety of appliances will be connected to\nthe web. We are\
    \ entering an era of the “Internet of Things”\n(abbreviated as IoT). This term\
    \ has been defined by different\nauthors in many different ways. Let us look at\
    \ two of the most\npopular definitions. Vermesan et al. [1] define the Internet\n\
    of Things as simply an interaction between the physical and\ndigital worlds. The\
    \ digital world interacts with the physical\nworld using a plethora of sensors\
    \ and actuators. Another\ndefinition by Pe˜na-L´opez et al. [2] defines the Internet\
    \ of\nThings as a paradigm in which computing and networking\ncapabilities are\
    \ embedded in any kind of conceivable object.\nWe use these capabilities to query\
    \ the state of the object and to\nchange its state if possible. In common parlance,\
    \ the Internet\nof Things refers to a new kind of world where almost all\nthe\
    \ devices and appliances that we use are connected to a\nnetwork. We can use them\
    \ collaboratively to achieve complex\ntasks that require a high degree of intelligence.\n\
    For this intelligence and interconnection, IoT devices are\nequipped with embedded\
    \ sensors, actuators, processors, and\ntransceivers. IoT is not a single technology;\
    \ rather it is an\nagglomeration of various technologies that work together in\n\
    tandem.\nSensors and actuators are devices, which help in interact-\ning with\
    \ the physical environment. The data collected by the\nsensors has to be stored\
    \ and processed intelligently in order to\nderive useful inferences from it. Note\
    \ that we broadly define\nthe term sensor; a mobile phone or even a microwave\
    \ oven\ncan count as a sensor as long as it provides inputs about its\ncurrent\
    \ state (internal state + environment). An actuator is a\ndevice that is used\
    \ to effect a change in the environment such\nas the temperature controller of\
    \ an air conditioner.\nThe storage and processing of data can be done on the\n\
    edge of the network itself or in a remote server. If any prepro-\ncessing of data\
    \ is possible, then it is typically done at either\nthe sensor or some other proximate\
    \ device. The processed\ndata is then typically sent to a remote server. The storage\n\
    and processing capabilities of an IoT object are also restricted\nby the resources\
    \ available, which are often very constrained\ndue to limitations of size, energy,\
    \ power, and computational\ncapability. As a result the main research challenge\
    \ is to\nensure that we get the right kind of data at the desired level\nof accuracy.\
    \ Along with the challenges of data collection,\nand handling, there are challenges\
    \ in communication as\nwell. The communication between IoT devices is mainly\n\
    wireless because they are generally installed at geographically\ndispersed locations.\
    \ The wireless channels often have high\nHindawi\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ reliably\ncommunicating data without too many retransmissions is an\nimportant\
    \ problem and thus communication technologies\nare integral to the study of IoT\
    \ devices.\nNow, after processing the received data, some action\nneeds to be\
    \ taken on the basis of the derived inferences. The\nnature of actions can be\
    \ diverse. We can directly modify the\nphysical world through actuators. Or we\
    \ may do something\nvirtually. For example, we can send some information to other\n\
    smart things.\nThe process of effecting a change in the physical world\nis often\
    \ dependent on its state at that point of time. This\nis called context awareness.\
    \ Each action is taken keeping in\nconsideration the context because an application\
    \ can behave\ndifferently in different contexts. For example, a person may\nnot\
    \ like messages from his office to interrupt him when he is\non vacation.\nSensors,\
    \ actuators, compute servers, and the commu-\nnication network form the core infrastructure\
    \ of an IoT\nframework. However, there are many software aspects that\nneed to\
    \ be considered. First, we need a middleware that can\nbe used to connect and\
    \ manage all of these heterogeneous\ncomponents. We need a lot of standardization\
    \ to connect\nmany different devices. We shall discuss methods to exchange\ninformation\
    \ and prevailing standards in Section 7.\nThe Internet of Things finds various\
    \ applications in health\ncare, fitness, education, entertainment, social life,\
    \ energy\nconservation, environment monitoring, home automation,\nand transport\
    \ systems. We shall focus on these application\nareas in Section 9. We shall find\
    \ that, in all these application\nareas, IoT technologies have significantly been\
    \ able to reduce\nhuman effort and improve the quality of life.\n2. Architecture\
    \ of IoT\nThere is no single consensus on architecture for IoT, which\nis agreed\
    \ universally. Different architectures have been pro-\nposed by different researchers.\n\
    2.1. Three- and Five-Layer Architectures. The most basic\narchitecture is a three-layer\
    \ architecture [3–5] as shown in\nFigure 1. It was introduced in the early stages\
    \ of research in\nthis area. It has three layers, namely, the perception, network,\n\
    and application layers.\n(i) The perception layer is the physical layer, which\
    \ has\nsensors for sensing and gathering information about\nthe environment. It\
    \ senses some physical parameters\nor identifies other smart objects in the environment.\n\
    (ii) The network layer is responsible for connecting to\nother smart things, network\
    \ devices, and servers. Its\nfeatures are also used for transmitting and processing\n\
    sensor data.\n(iii) The application layer is responsible for delivering\napplication\
    \ specific services to the user. It defines\nvarious applications in which the\
    \ Internet of Things\ncan be deployed, for example, smart homes, smart\ncities,\
    \ and smart health.\nThe three-layer architecture defines the main idea of the\n\
    Internet of Things, but it is not sufficient for research on\nIoT because research\
    \ often focuses on finer aspects of the\nInternet of Things. That is why, we have\
    \ many more layered\narchitectures proposed in the literature. One is the five-\n\
    layer architecture, which additionally includes the processing\nand business layers\
    \ [3–6]. The five layers are perception,\ntransport, processing, application,\
    \ and business layers (see\nFigure 1). The role of the perception and application\
    \ layers\nis the same as the architecture with three layers. We outline\nthe function\
    \ of the remaining three layers.\n(i) The transport layer transfers the sensor\
    \ data from\nthe perception layer to the processing layer and vice\nversa through\
    \ networks such as wireless, 3G, LAN,\nBluetooth, RFID, and NFC.\n(ii) The processing\
    \ layer is also known as the middleware\nlayer. It stores, analyzes, and processes\
    \ huge amounts\nof data that comes from the transport layer. It can\nmanage and\
    \ provide a diverse set of services to the\nlower layers. It employs many technologies\
    \ such as\ndatabases, cloud computing, and big data processing\nmodules.\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n3\n(iii) The business layer manages\
    \ the whole IoT system,\nincluding applications, business and profit models,\n\
    and users’ privacy. The business layer is out of the\nscope of this paper. Hence,\
    \ we do not discuss it\nfurther.\nAnother architecture proposed by Ning and Wang\
    \ [7] is\ninspired by the layers of processing in the human brain. It\nis inspired\
    \ by the intelligence and ability of human beings\nto think, feel, remember, make\
    \ decisions, and react to the\nphysical environment. It is constituted of three\
    \ parts. First is\nthe human brain, which is analogous to the processing and\n\
    data management unit or the data center. Second is the spinal\ncord, which is\
    \ analogous to the distributed network of data\nprocessing nodes and smart gateways.\
    \ Third is the network\nof nerves, which corresponds to the networking components\n\
    and sensors.\n2.2. Cloud and Fog Based Architectures. Let us now discuss\ntwo\
    \ kinds of systems architectures: cloud and fog computing\n(see the reference\
    \ architectures in [8]). Note that this classifi-\ncation is different from the\
    \ classification in Section 2.1, which\nwas done on the basis of protocols.\n\
    In particular, we have been slightly vague about the nature\nof data generated\
    \ by IoT devices, and the nature of data\nprocessing. In some system architectures\
    \ the data processing\nis done in a large centralized fashion by cloud computers.\n\
    Such a cloud centric architecture keeps the cloud at the\ncenter, applications\
    \ above it, and the network of smart things\nbelow it [9]. Cloud computing is\
    \ given primacy because it\nprovides great flexibility and scalability. It offers\
    \ services such\nas the core infrastructure, platform, software, and storage.\n\
    Developers can provide their storage tools, software tools,\ndata mining, and\
    \ machine learning tools, and visualization\ntools through the cloud.\nLately,\
    \ there is a move towards another system archi-\ntecture, namely, fog computing\
    \ [10–12], where the sensors\nand network gateways do a part of the data processing\
    \ and\nanalytics. A fog architecture [13] presents a layered approach\nas shown\
    \ in Figure 2, which inserts monitoring, prepro-\ncessing, storage, and security\
    \ layers between the physical\nand transport layers. The monitoring layer monitors\
    \ power,\nresources, responses, and services. The preprocessing layer\nperforms\
    \ filtering, processing, and analytics of sensor data.\nThe temporary storage\
    \ layer provides storage functionalities\nsuch as data replication, distribution,\
    \ and storage. Finally, the\nsecurity layer performs encryption/decryption and\
    \ ensures\ndata integrity and privacy. Monitoring and preprocessing are\ndone\
    \ on the edge of the network before sending data to the\ncloud.\nOften the terms\
    \ “fog computing” and “edge computing”\nare used interchangeably. The latter term\
    \ predates the former\nand is construed to be more generic. Fog computing originally\n\
    termed by Cisco refers to smart gateways and smart sensors,\nwhereas edge computing\
    \ is slightly more penetrative in nature.\nThis paradigm envisions adding smart\
    \ data preprocessing\ncapabilities to physical devices such as motors, pumps,\
    \ or\nlights. The aim is to do as much of preprocessing of data\nas possible in\
    \ these devices, which are termed to be at the\nStorage layer \nPreprocessing\
    \ layer \nMonitoring layer \nPhysical layer\nSecurity layer\nTransport layer\n\
    Figure 2: Fog architecture of a smart IoT gateway.\nedge of the network. In terms\
    \ of the system architecture,\nthe architectural diagram is not appreciably different\
    \ from\nFigure 2. As a result, we do not describe edge computing\nseparately.\n\
    Finally, the distinction between protocol architectures\nand system architectures\
    \ is not very crisp. Often the protocols\nand the system are codesigned. We shall\
    \ use the generic 5-\nlayer IoT protocol stack (architectural diagram presented\
    \ in\nFigure 2) for both the fog and cloud architectures.\n2.3. Social IoT. Let\
    \ us now discuss a new paradigm: social IoT\n(SIoT). Here, we consider social\
    \ relationships between objects\nthe same way as humans form social relationships\
    \ (see [14]).\nHere are the three main facets of an SIoT system:\n(i) The SIoT\
    \ is navigable. We can start with one device\nand navigate through all the devices\
    \ that are con-\nnected to it. It is easy to discover new devices and\nservices\
    \ using such a social network of IoT devices.\n(ii) A need of trustworthiness\
    \ (strength of the relation-\nship) is present between devices (similar to friends\
    \ on\nFacebook).\n(iii) We can use models similar to studying human social\nnetworks\
    \ to also study the social networks of IoT\ndevices.\n2.3.1. Basic Components.\
    \ In a typical social IoT setting, we\ntreat the devices and services as bots\
    \ where they can set up\nrelationships between them and modify them over time.\
    \ This\nwill allow us to seamlessly let the devices cooperate among\neach other\
    \ and achieve a complex task.\nTo make such a model work, we need to have many\n\
    interoperating components. Let us look at some of the major\ncomponents in such\
    \ a system.\n(1) ID: we need a unique method of object identifica-\ntion. An ID\
    \ can be assigned to an object based on\ntraditional parameters such as the MAC\
    \ ID, IPv6\nID, a universal product code, or some other custom\nmethod.\n4\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(2) Metainformation: along with an ID,\
    \ we need some\nmetainformation about the device that describes its\nform and\
    \ operation. This is required to establish\nappropriate relationships with the\
    \ device and also\nappropriately place it in the universe of IoT devices.\n(3)\
    \ Security controls: this is similar to “friend list” set-\ntings on Facebook.\
    \ An owner of a device might place\nrestrictions on the kinds of devices that\
    \ can connect\nto it. These are typically referred to as owner controls.\n(4)\
    \ Service discovery: such kind of a system is like\na service cloud, where we\
    \ need to have dedicated\ndirectories that store details of devices providing\n\
    certain kinds of services. It becomes very important\nto keep these directories\
    \ up to date such that devices\ncan learn about other devices.\n(5) Relationship\
    \ management: this module manages rela-\ntionships with other devices. It also\
    \ stores the types\nof devices that a given device should try to connect\nwith\
    \ based on the type of services provided. For\nexample, it makes sense for a light\
    \ controller to make\na relationship with a light sensor.\n(6) Service composition:\
    \ this module takes the social IoT\nmodel to a new level. The ultimate goal of\
    \ having such\na system is to provide better integrated services to\nusers. For\
    \ example, if a person has a power sensor\nwith her air conditioner and this device\
    \ establishes\na relationship with an analytics engine, then it is\npossible for\
    \ the ensemble to yield a lot of data about\nthe usage patterns of the air conditioner.\
    \ If the social\nmodel is more expansive, and there are many more\ndevices, then\
    \ it is possible to compare the data with\nthe usage patterns of other users and\
    \ come up with\neven more meaningful data. For example, users can\nbe told that\
    \ they are the largest energy consumers in\ntheir community or among their Facebook\
    \ friends.\n2.3.2. Representative Architecture. Most architectures pro-\nposed\
    \ for the SIoT have a server side architecture as well.\nThe server connects to\
    \ all the interconnected components,\naggregates (composes) the services, and\
    \ acts as a single point\nof service for users.\nThe server side architecture\
    \ typically has three layers. The\nfirst is the base layer that contains a database\
    \ that stores details\nof all the devices, their attributes, metainformation,\
    \ and their\nrelationships. The second layer (Component layer) contains\ncode\
    \ to interact with the devices, query their status, and use\na subset of them\
    \ to effect a service. The topmost layer is the\napplication layer, which provides\
    \ services to the users.\nOn the device (object) side, we broadly have two layers.\n\
    The first is the object layer, which allows a device to connect to\nother devices,\
    \ talk to them (via standardized protocols), and\nexchange information. The object\
    \ layer passes information to\nthe social layer. The social layer manages the\
    \ execution of\nusers’ applications, executes queries, and interacts with the\n\
    application layer on the server.\n3. Taxonomy\nLet us now propose taxonomy for\
    \ research in IoT tech-\nnologies (see Figure 3). Our taxonomy is based on the\n\
    architectural elements of IoT as presented in Section 2.\nThe first architectural\
    \ component of IoT is the perception\nlayer. It collects data using sensors, which\
    \ are the most\nimportant drivers of the Internet of Things [15]. There are\n\
    various types of sensors used in diverse IoT applications.\nThe most generic sensor\
    \ available today is the smartphone.\nThe smartphone itself has many types of\
    \ sensors embedded\nin it [16] such as the location sensor (GPS), movement\nsensors\
    \ (accelerometer, gyroscope), camera, light sensor,\nmicrophone, proximity sensor,\
    \ and magnetometer. These are\nbeing heavily used in different IoT applications.\
    \ Many other\ntypes of sensors are beginning to be used such as sensors for\n\
    measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, medical param-\neters of the body,\
    \ chemical and biochemical substances, and\nneural signals. A class of sensors\
    \ that stand out is infrared\nsensors that predate smartphones. They are now being\
    \ used\nwidely in many IoT applications: IR cameras, motion detec-\ntors, measuring\
    \ the distance to nearby objects, presence of\nsmoke and gases, and as moisture\
    \ sensors. We shall discuss\nthe different types of sensors used in IoT applications\
    \ in\nSection 5.\nSubsequently, we shall discuss related work in data pre-\nprocessing.\
    \ Such applications (also known as fog comput-\ning applications) mainly filter\
    \ and summarize data before\nsending it on the network. Such units typically have\
    \ a little\namount of temporary storage, a small processing unit, and\nsome security\
    \ features.\nThe next architectural component that we shall discuss\nis communication.\
    \ We shall discuss related work (in Sec-\ntion 7) on different communication technologies\
    \ used for\nthe Internet of Things. Different entities communicate over\nthe network\
    \ [17–19] using a diverse set of protocols and\nstandards. The most common communication\
    \ technologies\nfor short range low power communication protocols are\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification) and NFC (Near Field\nCommunication). For the medium\
    \ range, they are Bluetooth,\nZigbee, and WiFi. Communication in the IoT world\
    \ requires\nspecial networking protocols and mechanisms. Therefore,\nnew mechanisms\
    \ and protocols have been proposed and\nimplemented for each layer of the networking\
    \ stack, accord-\ning to the requirements imposed by IoT devices.\nWe shall subsequently\
    \ look at two kinds of software com-\nponents: middleware and applications. The\
    \ middleware cre-\nates an abstraction for the programmer such that the details\n\
    of the hardware can be hidden. This enhances interoperability\nof smart things\
    \ and makes it easy to offer different kinds of\nservices [20]. There are many\
    \ commercial and open source\nofferings for providing middleware services to IoT\
    \ devices.\nSome examples are OpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], Hydra\n[23], FiWare\
    \ [24], and Oracle Fusion Middleware. Finally, we\ndiscuss the applications of\
    \ IoT in Section 9. We primarily\nfocus on home automation, ambient assisted living,\
    \ health\nand fitness, smart vehicular systems, smart cities, smart\nenvironments,\
    \ smart grids, social life, and entertainment.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of research in IoT technologies.\n4. Related Survey Papers\nOur taxonomy describes\
    \ the technologies in the IoT domain\nand is classified on the basis of architectural\
    \ layers. We\nhave tried to cover all subareas and recent technologies in\nour\
    \ taxonomy. There have been many survey papers on the\nInternet of Things in the\
    \ past. Table 1 shows how our survey\nis different from other highly cited surveys\
    \ in the literature.\nLet us first consider our novel contributions. Our paper\n\
    looks at each and every layer in the IoT stack, and as a\nresult the presentation\
    \ is also far more balanced. A novel\naddition in our survey is that we have discussed\
    \ different IoT\narchitectures. This has not been discussed in prior surveys on\n\
    the Internet of Things. The architecture section also considers\nnewer paradigms\
    \ such as fog computing, which have also\nhitherto not been considered. Moreover,\
    \ our survey nicely\ncategorizes technologies based on the architectural layer\n\
    that they belong to. We have also thoroughly categorized\nthe network layer and\
    \ tried to consolidate almost all the\ntechnologies that are used in IoT systems.\
    \ Such kind of a\nthorough categorization and presentation of technologies is\n\
    novel to the best of our knowledge.\nAlong with these novel contributions our\
    \ survey is far\nmore comprehensive, detailed, and exhaustive as compared\nto\
    \ other surveys in the area. Most of the other surveys look\nat only one or two\
    \ types of sensors, whereas we describe\n9 types of sensors with many examples.\
    \ Other surveys\nare also fairly restricted when they discuss communication\n\
    technologies and applications. We have discussed many types\nof middleware technologies\
    \ as well. Prior works have not\ngiven middleware technologies this level of attention.\
    \ We\ncover 10 communication technologies in detail and consider\na large variety\
    \ of applications encompassing smart homes,\nhealth care, logistics, transport,\
    \ agriculture, environment,\nsmart cities, and green energy. No other survey in\
    \ this area\nprofiles so many technologies, applications, and use cases.\n5. Sensors\
    \ and Actuators\nAll IoT applications need to have one or more sensors to\ncollect\
    \ data from the environment. Sensors are essential\ncomponents of smart objects.\
    \ One of the most important\naspects of the Internet of Things is context awareness,\
    \ which\nis not possible without sensor technology. IoT sensors are\nmostly small\
    \ in size, have low cost, and consume less power.\nThey are constrained by factors\
    \ such as battery capacity and\nease of deployment. Schmidt and Van Laerhoven\
    \ [25] provide\nan overview of various types of sensors used for building\nsmart\
    \ applications.\n5.1. Mobile Phone Based Sensors. First of all, let us look at\n\
    the mobile phone, which is ubiquitous and has many types\nof sensors embedded\
    \ in it. In specific, the smartphone is\na very handy and user friendly device\
    \ that has a host of\nbuilt in communication and data processing features. With\n\
    the increasing popularity of smartphones among people,\nresearchers are showing\
    \ interest in building smart IoT solu-\ntions using smartphones because of the\
    \ embedded sensors\n[16, 26]. Some additional sensors can also be used depending\n\

    \ can be built on the\nsmartphone that uses sensor data to produce meaningful\n\
    results. Some of the sensors inside a modern smartphone are\nas follows.\n(1)\
    \ The accelerometer senses the motion and acceleration\nof a mobile phone. It\
    \ typically measures changes in\nvelocity of the smartphone in three dimensions.\
    \ There\nare many types of accelerometers [27].\nIn a mechanical accelerometer,\
    \ we have a seismic\nmass in a housing, which is tied to the housing\nwith a spring.\
    \ The mass takes time to move and is\nleft behind as the housing moves, so the\
    \ force in\nthe spring can be correlated with the acceleration.\nIn a capacitive\
    \ accelerometer, capacitive plates are\nused with the same setup. With a change\
    \ in velocity,\nthe mass pushes the capacitive plates together, thus\nchanging\
    \ the capacitance. The rate of change of\ncapacitance is then converted into acceleration.\
    \ In\na piezoelectric accelerometer, piezoelectric crystals\nare used, which when\
    \ squeezed generate an electric\nvoltage. The changes in voltage can be translated\
    \ into\nacceleration.\nThe data patterns captured by the accelerometer can\nbe\
    \ used to detect physical activities of the user such as\nrunning, walking, and\
    \ bicycling.\n(2) The gyroscope detects the orientation of the phone\nvery precisely.\
    \ Orientation is measured using capac-\nitive changes when a seismic mass moves\
    \ in a partic-\nular direction.\n(3) The camera and microphone are very powerful\
    \ sen-\nsors since they capture visual and audio information,\nwhich can then\
    \ be analyzed and processed to detect\nvarious types of contextual information.\
    \ For example,\nwe can infer a user’s current environment and the\ninteractions\
    \ that she is having. To make sense of the\naudio data, technologies such as voice\
    \ recognition\nand acoustic features can be exploited.\n(4) The magnetometer detects\
    \ magnetic fields. This can\nbe used as a digital compass and in applications\
    \ to\ndetect the presence of metals.\n(5) The GPS (Global Positioning System)\
    \ detects the\nlocation of the phone, which is one of the most\nimportant pieces\
    \ of contextual information for smart\napplications. The location is detected\
    \ using the prin-\nciple of trilateration [28]. The distance is measured\nfrom\
    \ three or more satellites (or mobile phone towers\nin the case of A-GPS) and\
    \ coordinates are computed.\n(6) The light sensor detects the intensity of ambient\
    \ light.\nIt can be used for setting the brightness of the screen\nand other applications\
    \ in which some action is to be\ntaken depending on the intensity of ambient light.\
    \ For\nexample, we can control the lights in a room.\n(7) The proximity sensor\
    \ uses an infrared (IR) LED,\nwhich emits IR rays. These rays bounce back when\n\
    they strike some object. Based on the difference in\ntime, we can calculate the\
    \ distance. In this way, the\ndistance to different objects from the phone can\
    \ be\nmeasured. For example, we can use it to determine\nwhen the phone is close\
    \ to the face while talking. It\ncan also be used in applications in which we\
    \ have\nto trigger some event when an object approaches the\nphone.\n(8) Some\
    \ smartphones such as Samsung’s Galaxy S4 also\nhave a thermometer, barometer,\
    \ and humidity sensor\nto measure the temperature, atmospheric pressure,\nand\
    \ humidity, respectively.\nWe have studied many smart applications that use sensor\n\
    data collected from smartphones. For example, activity detec-\ntion [29] is achieved\
    \ by applying machine learning algorithms\nto the data collected by smartphone\
    \ sensors. It detects activi-\nties such as running, going up and down stairs,\
    \ walking, driv-\ning, and cycling. The application is trained with patterns of\n\
    data using data sets recorded by sensors when these activities\nare being performed.\n\
    Many health and fitness applications are being built to\nkeep track of a person’s\
    \ health continuously using smart-\nphones. They keep track of users’ physical\
    \ activities, diet,\nexercises, and lifestyle to determine the fitness level and\n\
    give suggestions to the user accordingly. Wang et al. [30]\ndescribe a mobile\
    \ application that is based completely on a\nsmartphone. They use it to assess\
    \ the overall mental health\nand performance of a college student. To track the\
    \ location\nand activities in which the student is involved, activity\nrecognition\
    \ (accelerometer) and GPS data are used. To keep\na check on how much the student\
    \ sleeps, the accelerometer\nand light sensors are used. For social life and conversations,\n\
    audio data from a microphone is used. The application also\nconducts quick questionnaires\
    \ with the students to know\nabout their mood. All this data can be used to assess\
    \ the stress\nlevels, social life, behavior, and exercise patterns of a student.\n\
    Another application by McClernon and Choudhury [31]\ndetects when the user is\
    \ going to smoke using context\ninformation such as the presence of other smokers,\
    \ location,\nand associated activities. The sensors provide information\nrelated\
    \ to the user’s movement, location, visual images, and\nsurrounding sounds. To\
    \ summarize smartphone sensors are\nbeing used to study different kinds of human\
    \ behavior (see\n[32]) and to improve the quality of human life.\n5.2. Medical\
    \ Sensors. The Internet of Things can be really\nbeneficial for health care applications.\
    \ We can use sensors,\nwhich can measure and monitor various medical parameters\n\
    in the human body [33]. These applications can aim at\nmonitoring a patient’s\
    \ health when they are not in hospital or\nwhen they are alone. Subsequently,\
    \ they can provide real time\nfeedback to the doctor, relatives, or the patient.\
    \ McGrath and\nScanaill [34] have described in detail the different sensors that\n\
    can be worn on the body for monitoring a person’s health.\nThere are many wearable\
    \ sensing devices available in the\nmarket. They are equipped with medical sensors\
    \ that are\ncapable of measuring different parameters such as the heart\nrate,\
    \ pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration\nrate, and blood glucose\
    \ levels [35]. These wearables include\n8\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nFigure 4: Smart watches and fitness trackers (source:https://www\n\
    .pebble.com/ and http://www.fitbit.com/).\nFigure 5: Embedded skin patches (source:\
    \ MC10 Electronics).\nsmart watches, wristbands, monitoring patches, and smart\n\
    textiles.\nMoreover, smart watches and fitness trackers are becom-\ning fairly\
    \ popular in the market as companies such as Apple,\nSamsung, and Sony are coming\
    \ up with very innovative\nfeatures. For example, a smart watch includes features\
    \ such\nas connectivity with a smartphone, sensors such as an\naccelerometer,\
    \ and a heart rate monitor (see Figure 4).\nAnother novel IoT device, which has\
    \ a lot of promise are\nmonitoring patches that are pasted on the skin. Monitoring\n\
    patches are like tattoos. They are stretchable and disposable\nand are very cheap.\
    \ These patches are supposed to be worn\nby the patient for a few days to monitor\
    \ a vital health\nparameter continuously [15]. All the electronic components\n\
    are embedded in these rubbery structures. They can even\ntransmit the sensed data\
    \ wirelessly. Just like a tattoo, these\npatches can be applied on the skin as\
    \ shown in Figure 5.\nOne of the most common applications of such patches is to\n\
    monitor blood pressure.\nA very important consideration here is the context [34].\n\
    The data collected by the medical sensors must be combined\nwith contextual information\
    \ such as physical activity. For\nexample, the heart rate depends on the context.\
    \ It increases\nwhen we exercise. In that case, we cannot infer abnormal\nheart\
    \ rate. Therefore, we need to combine data from different\nsensors for making\
    \ the correct inference.\nFigure 6: Brain sensing headband with embedded neurosensors\n\
    (source: http://www.choosemuse.com/).\n5.3. Neural Sensors. Today, it is possible\
    \ to understand\nneural signals in the brain, infer the state of the brain, and\n\
    train it for better attention and focus. This is known as\nneurofeedback [36]\
    \ (see Figure 6). The technology used for\nreading brain signals is called EEG\
    \ (Electroencephalography)\nor a brain computer interface. The neurons inside\
    \ the brain\ncommunicate electronically and create an electric field, which\n\
    can be measured from outside in terms of frequencies. Brain\nwaves can be categorized\
    \ into alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and\ndelta waves depending upon the frequency.\n\
    Based on the type of wave, it can be inferred whether\nthe brain is calm or wandering\
    \ in thoughts. This type of\nneurofeedback can be obtained in real time and can\
    \ be used\nto train the brain to focus, pay better attention towards things,\n\
    manage stress, and have better mental well-being.\n5.4. Environmental and Chemical\
    \ Sensors. Environmental\nsensors are used to sense parameters in the physical\
    \ environ-\nment such as temperature, humidity, pressure, water pollu-\ntion,\
    \ and air pollution. Parameters such as the temperature\nand pressure can be measured\
    \ with a thermometer and\nbarometer. Air quality can be measured with sensors,\
    \ which\nsense the presence of gases and other particulate matter in the\nair\
    \ (refer to Sekhar et al. [37] for more details).\nChemical sensors are used to\
    \ detect chemical and bio-\nchemical substances. These sensors consist of a recognition\n\
    element and a transducer. The electronic nose (e-nose) and\nelectronic tongue\
    \ (e-tongue) are technologies that can be\nused to sense chemicals on the basis\
    \ of odor and taste,\nrespectively [38]. The e-nose and e-tongue consist of an\
    \ array\nof chemical sensors coupled with advance pattern recognition\nsoftware.\
    \ The sensors inside the e-nose and e-tongue produce\ncomplex data, which is then\
    \ analyzed through pattern recog-\nnition to identify the stimulus.\nThese sensors\
    \ can be used in monitoring the pollution\nlevel in smart cities [39], keeping\
    \ a check on food quality\nin smart kitchens, testing food, and agricultural products\
    \ in\nsupply chain applications.\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\
    9\n5.5. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). RFID is an iden-\ntification technology\
    \ in which an RFID tag (a small chip with\nan antenna) carries data, which is\
    \ read by a RFID reader. The\ntag transmits the data stored in it via radio waves.\
    \ It is similar\nto bar code technology. But unlike a traditional bar code, it\n\
    does not require line of sight communication between the tag\nand the reader and\
    \ can identify itself from a distance even\nwithout a human operator. The range\
    \ of RFID varies with the\nfrequency. It can go up to hundreds of meters.\nRFID\
    \ tags are of two types: active and passive. Active tags\nhave a power source\
    \ and passive tags do not have any power\nsource. Passive tags draw power from\
    \ the electromagnetic\nwaves emitted by the reader and are thus cheap and have\
    \ a\nlong lifetime [40, 41].\nThere are two types of RFID technologies: near and\
    \ far\n[40]. A near RFID reader uses a coil through which we pass\nalternating\
    \ current and generate a magnetic field. The tag has\na smaller coil, which generates\
    \ a potential due to the ambient\nchanges in the magnetic field. This voltage\
    \ is then coupled\nwith a capacitor to accumulate a charge, which then powers\n\
    up the tag chip. The tag can then produce a small magnetic\nfield that encodes\
    \ the signal to be transmitted, and this can\nbe picked up by the reader.\nIn\
    \ far RFID, there is a dipole antenna in the reader, which\npropagates EM waves.\
    \ The tag also has a dipole antenna on\nwhich an alternating potential difference\
    \ appears and it is\npowered up. It can then use this power to transmit messages.\n\
    RFID technology is being used in various applications\nsuch as supply chain management,\
    \ access control, identity\nauthentication, and object tracking. The RFID tag\
    \ is attached\nto the object to be tracked and the reader detects and records\n\
    its presence when the object passes by it. In this manner,\nobject movement can\
    \ be tracked and RFID can serve as a\nsearch engine for smart things.\nFor access\
    \ control, an RFID tag is attached to the\nauthorized object. For example, small\
    \ chips are glued to the\nfront of vehicles. When the car reaches a barricade\
    \ on which\nthere is a reader, it reads the tag data and decides whether it\n\
    is an authorized car. If yes, it opens automatically. RFID cards\nare issued to\
    \ the people, who can then be identified by a RFID\nreader and given access accordingly.\n\
    The low level data collected from the RFID tags can be\ntransformed into higher\
    \ level insights in IoT applications\n[42]. There are many user level tools available,\
    \ in which all the\ndata collected by particular RFID readers and data associated\n\
    with the RFID tags can be managed. The high level data can\nbe used to draw inferences\
    \ and take further action.\n5.6. Actuators. Let us look at some examples of actuators\
    \ that\nare used in the Internet of Things. An actuator is a device,\nwhich can\
    \ effect a change in the environment by converting\nelectrical energy into some\
    \ form of useful energy. Some\nexamples are heating or cooling elements, speakers,\
    \ lights,\ndisplays, and motors.\nThe actuators, which induce motion, can be classified\
    \ into\nthree categories, namely, electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic\nactuators\
    \ depending on their operation. Hydraulic actuators\nfacilitate mechanical motion\
    \ using fluid or hydraulic power.\nPneumatic actuators use the pressure of compressed\
    \ air and\nelectrical ones use electrical energy.\nAs an example, we can consider\
    \ a smart home system,\nwhich consists of many sensors and actuators. The actuators\n\
    are used to lock/unlock the doors, switch on/off the lights or\nother electrical\
    \ appliances, alert users of any threats through\nalarms or notifications, and\
    \ control the temperature of a\nhome (via a thermostat).\nA sophisticated example\
    \ of an actuator used in IoT is\na digital finger, which is used to turn on/off\
    \ the switches\n(or anything which requires small motion) and is controlled\n\
    wirelessly.\n6. Preprocessing\nAs smart things collect huge amount of sensor data,\
    \ compute\nand storage resources are required to analyze, store, and\nprocess\
    \ this data. The most common compute and storage\nresources are cloud based because\
    \ the cloud offers massive\ndata handling, scalability, and flexibility. But this\
    \ will not be\nsufficient to meet the requirements of many IoT applications\n\
    because of the following reasons [43].\n(1) Mobility: most of the smart devices\
    \ are mobile. Their\nchanging location makes it difficult to communicate\nwith\
    \ the cloud data center because of changing net-\nwork conditions across different\
    \ locations.\n(2) Reliable and real time actuation: communicating with\nthe cloud\
    \ and getting back responses takes time.\nLatency sensitive applications, which\
    \ need real time\nresponses, may not be feasible with this model. Also,\nthe communication\
    \ may be lossy due to wireless links,\nwhich can lead to unreliable data.\n(3)\
    \ Scalability: more devices means more requests to the\ncloud, thereby increasing\
    \ the latency.\n(4) Power constraints: communication consumes a lot of\npower,\
    \ and IoT devices are battery powered. They\nthus cannot afford to communicate\
    \ all the time.\nTo solve the problem of mobility, researchers have pro-\nposed\
    \ mobile cloud computing (MCC) [44]. But there are\nstill problems associated\
    \ with latency and power. MCC also\nsuffers from mobility problems such as frequently\
    \ changing\nnetwork conditions due to which problems such as signal\nfading and\
    \ service degradation arise.\nAs a solution to these problems, we can bring some\n\
    compute and storage resources to the edge of the network\ninstead of relying on\
    \ the cloud for everything. This concept\nis known as fog computing [11, 45] (also\
    \ see Section 2.2).\nThe fog can be viewed as a cloud, which is close to the\n\
    ground. Data can be stored, processed, filtered, and analyzed\non the edge of\
    \ the network before sending it to the cloud\nthrough expensive communication\
    \ media. The fog and cloud\nparadigms go together. Both of them are required for\
    \ the\noptimal performance of IoT applications. A smart gateway\n[13] can be employed\
    \ between underlying networks and the\ncloud to realize fog computing as shown\
    \ in Figure 7.\nThe features of fog computing [11] are as follows:\n(1) Low latency:\
    \ less time is required to access computing\nand storage resources on fog nodes\
    \ (smart gateways).\n10\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nSmart\
    \ devices\nSmart gateway\nLocal real time analysis \npreprocessing\nﬁltering\n\
    Cloud data center \nGlobal data analytics\nstorage\ndata\ndata\nFigure 7: Smart\
    \ gateway for preprocessing.\n(2) Location awareness: as the fog is located on\
    \ the edge\nof the network, it is aware of the location of the\napplications and\
    \ their context. This is beneficial as\ncontext awareness is an important feature\
    \ of IoT\napplications.\n(3) Distributed nodes: fog nodes are distributed unlike\n\
    centralized cloud nodes. Multiple fog nodes need to\nbe deployed in distributed\
    \ geographical areas in order\nto provide services to mobile devices in those\
    \ areas.\nFor example, in vehicular networks, deploying fog\nnodes at highways\
    \ can provide low latency data/video\nstreaming to vehicles.\n(4) Mobility: the\
    \ fog supports mobility as smart devices\ncan directly communicate with smart\
    \ gateways\npresent in their proximity.\n(5) Real time response: fog nodes can\
    \ give an immediate\nresponse unlike the cloud, which has a much greater\nlatency.\n\
    (6) Interaction with the cloud: fog nodes can further\ninteract with the cloud\
    \ and communicate only that\ndata, which is required to be sent to the cloud.\n\
    The tasks performed by a smart gateway [46] are col-\nlecting sensor data, preprocessing\
    \ and filtering collected\ndata, providing compute, storage and networking services\n\
    to IoT devices, communicating with the cloud and sending\nonly necessary data,\
    \ monitoring power consumption of IoT\ndevices, monitoring activities and services\
    \ of IoT devices, and\nensuring security and privacy of data. Some applications\
    \ of\nfog computing are as follows [10, 11]:\n(1) Smart vehicular networks: smart\
    \ traffic lights are\ndeployed as smart gateways to locally detect pedes-\ntrians\
    \ and vehicles through sensors, calculate their\ndistance and speed, and finally\
    \ infer traffic conditions.\nThis is used to warn oncoming vehicles. These sensors\n\
    also interact with neighboring smart traffic lights\nto perform traffic management\
    \ tasks. For example,\nif sensors detect an approaching ambulance, they\ncan change\
    \ the traffic lights to let the ambulance\npass first and also inform other lights\
    \ to do so. The\ndata collected by these smart traffic lights are locally\nanalyzed\
    \ in real time to serve real time needs of traffic\nmanagement. Further, data\
    \ from multiple gateways\nis combined and sent to the cloud for further global\n\
    analysis of traffic in the city.\n(2) Smart grid: the smart electrical grid facilitates\
    \ load\nbalancing of energy on the basis of usage and avail-\nability. This is\
    \ done in order to switch automatically\nto alternative sources of energy such\
    \ as solar and\nwind power. This balancing can be done at the edge\nof the network\
    \ using smart meters or microgrids\nconnected by smart gateways. These gateways\
    \ can\nanalyze and process data. They can then project future\nenergy demand,\
    \ calculate the availability and price of\npower, and supply power from both conventional\
    \ and\nalternative sources to consumers.\n7. Communication\nAs the Internet of\
    \ Things is growing very rapidly, there are a\nlarge number of heterogeneous smart\
    \ devices connecting to\nthe Internet. IoT devices are battery powered, with minimal\n\
    compute and storage resources. Because of their constrained\nnature, there are\
    \ various communication challenges involved,\nwhich are as follows [19]:\n(1)\
    \ Addressing and identification: since millions of smart\nthings will be connected\
    \ to the Internet, they will\nhave to be identified through a unique address,\
    \ on the\nbasis of which they communicate with each other. For\nthis, we need\
    \ a large addressing space, and a unique\naddress for each smart object.\n(2)\
    \ Low power communication: communication of data\nbetween devices is a power consuming\
    \ task, specially,\nwireless communication. Therefore, we need a solu-\ntion that\
    \ facilitates communication with low power\nconsumption.\n(3) Routing protocols\
    \ with low memory requirement and\nefficient communication patterns.\n(4) High\
    \ speed and nonlossy communication.\n(5) Mobility of smart things.\nIoT devices\
    \ typically connect to the Internet through\nthe IP (Internet Protocol) stack.\
    \ This stack is very complex\nand demands a large amount of power and memory from\n\
    the connecting devices. The IoT devices can also connect\nlocally through non-IP\
    \ networks, which consume less power,\nand connect to the Internet via a smart\
    \ gateway. Non-IP\ncommunication channels such as Bluetooth, RFID, and NFC\nare\
    \ fairly popular but are limited in their range (up to a\nfew meters). Therefore,\
    \ their applications are limited to small\npersonal area networks. Personal area\
    \ networks (PAN) are\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n11\nbeing\
    \ widely used in IoT applications such as wearables\nconnected to smartphones.\
    \ For increasing the range of such\nlocal networks, there was a need to modify\
    \ the IP stack so as to\nfacilitate low power communication using the IP stack.\
    \ One\nof the solutions is 6LoWPAN, which incorporates IPv6 with\nlow power personal\
    \ area networks. The range of a PAN with\n6LoWPAN is similar to local area networks,\
    \ and the power\nconsumption is much lower.\nThe leading communication technologies\
    \ used in the IoT\nworld are IEEE 802.15.4, low power WiFi, 6LoWPAN, RFID,\nNFC,\
    \ Sigfox, LoraWAN, and other proprietary protocols for\nwireless networks.\n7.1.\
    \ Near Field Communication (NFC). Near Field Communi-\ncation [47–49] is a very\
    \ short range wireless communication\ntechnology, through which mobile devices\
    \ can interact with\neach other over a distance of few centimeters only. All types\
    \ of\ndata can be transferred between two NFC enabled devices in\nseconds by bringing\
    \ them close to each other. This technology\nis based on RFID. It uses variations\
    \ in the magnetic field\nto communicate data between two NFC enabled devices.\n\
    NFC operates over a frequency band of 13.56 MHz, which is\nthe same as high frequency\
    \ RFID. There are two modes of\noperation: active and passive. In the active mode,\
    \ both the\ndevices generate magnetic fields, while in the passive mode,\nonly\
    \ one device generates the field and the other uses load\nmodulation to transfer\
    \ the data. The passive mode is useful in\nbattery powered devices to optimize\
    \ energy use. One benefit\nof the requirement of close proximity between devices\
    \ is that\nit is useful for secure transactions such as payments. Finally,\nnote\
    \ that NFC can be used for two-way communication\nunlike RFID. Consequently, almost\
    \ all smartphones in the\nmarket today are NFC enabled.\n7.2. Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks (WSN) Based on IP for Smart\nObjects. Many times, data from a single\
    \ sensor is not useful\nin monitoring large areas and complex activities. Different\n\
    sensor nodes need to interact with each other wirelessly. The\ndisadvantage of\
    \ non-IP technologies such as RFID, NFC,\nand Bluetooth is that their range is\
    \ very small. So, they\ncannot be used in many applications, where a large area\
    \ needs\nto be monitored through many sensor nodes deployed in\ndiverse locations.\
    \ A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists\nof tens to thousands of sensor nodes\
    \ connected using wireless\ntechnologies. They collect data about the environment\
    \ and\ncommunicate it to gateway devices that relay the information\nto the cloud\
    \ over the Internet. The communication between\nnodes in a WSN may be direct or\
    \ multihop. The sensor nodes\nare of a constrained nature, but gateway nodes have\
    \ suffi-\ncient power and processing resources. The popular network\ntopologies\
    \ used in a WSN are a star, a mesh, and a hybrid\nnetwork. Most of the communication\
    \ in WSN is based on the\nIEEE 802.15.4 standard (discussed in Section 7.3). There\
    \ are\nclearly a lot of protocols that can be used in IoT scenarios.\nLet us discuss\
    \ the design of a typical IoT network protocol\nstack with the most popular alternatives.\n\
    7.3. IoT Network Protocol Stack. The Internet Engineering\nTask Force (IETF) has\
    \ developed alternative protocols for\ncommunication between IoT devices using\
    \ IP because IP is a\nflexible and reliable standard [50, 51]. The Internet Protocol\n\
    for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance has published various\nwhite papers describing\
    \ alternative protocols and standards\nfor the layers of the IP stack and an additional\
    \ adaptation\nlayer, which is used for communication [51–54] between\nsmart objects.\n\
    (1) Physical and MAC Layer (IEEE 802.15.4). The IEEE\n802.15.4 protocol is designed\
    \ for enabling communication\nbetween compact and inexpensive low power embedded\n\
    devices that need a long battery life. It defines standards and\nprotocols for\
    \ the physical and link (MAC) layer of the IP\nstack. It supports low power communication\
    \ along with low\ncost and short range communication. In the case of such\nresource\
    \ constrained environments, we need a small frame\nsize, low bandwidth, and low\
    \ transmit power.\nTransmission requires very little power (maximum one\nmilliwatt),\
    \ which is only one percent of that used in WiFi or\ncellular networks. This limits\
    \ the range of communication.\nBecause of the limited range, the devices have\
    \ to operate\ncooperatively in order to enable multihop routing over\nlonger distances.\
    \ As a result, the packet size is limited to\n127 bytes only, and the rate of\
    \ communication is limited to\n250 kbps. The coding scheme in IEEE 802.15.4 has\
    \ built in\nredundancy, which makes the communication robust, allows\nus to detect\
    \ losses, and enables the retransmission of lost\npackets. The protocol also supports\
    \ short 16-bit link addresses\nto decrease the size of the header, communication\
    \ overheads,\nand memory requirements [55].\nReaders can refer to the survey by\
    \ Vasseur et al. [54]\nfor more information on different physical and link layer\n\
    technologies for communication between smart objects.\n(2) Adaptation Layer. IPv6\
    \ is considered the best protocol for\ncommunication in the IoT domain because\
    \ of its scalability\nand stability. Such bulky IP protocols were initially not\n\
    thought to be suitable for communication in scenarios with\nlow power wireless\
    \ links such as IEEE 802.15.4.\n6LoWPAN, an acronym for IPv6 over low power wireless\n\
    personal area networks, is a very popular standard for\nwireless communication.\
    \ It enables communication using\nIPv6 over the IEEE 802.15.4 [52] protocol. This\
    \ standard\ndefines an adaptation layer between the 802.15.4 link layer\nand the\
    \ transport layer. 6LoWPAN devices can communicate\nwith all other IP based devices\
    \ on the Internet. The choice\nof IPv6 is because of the large addressing space\
    \ available\nin IPv6. 6LoWPAN networks connect to the Internet via a\ngateway\
    \ (WiFi or Ethernet), which also has protocol support\nfor conversion between\
    \ IPv4 and IPv6 as today’s deployed\nInternet is mostly IPv4. IPv6 headers are\
    \ not small enough\nto fit within the small 127 byte MTU of the 802.15.4 standard.\n\
    Hence, squeezing and fragmenting the packets to carry\nonly the essential information\
    \ is an optimization that the\nadaptation layer performs.\nSpecifically, the adaptation\
    \ layer performs the following\nthree optimizations in order to reduce communication\
    \ over-\nhead [55]:\n12\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(i) Header\
    \ compression 6loWPAN defines header com-\npression of IPv6 packets for decreasing\
    \ the overhead\nof IPv6. Some of the fields are deleted because they\ncan be derived\
    \ from link level information or can be\nshared across packets.\n(ii) Fragmentation:\
    \ the minimum MTU size (maximum\ntransmission unit) of IPv6 is 1280 bytes. On\
    \ the other\nhand, the maximum size of a frame in IEEE 802.15.4\nis 127 bytes.\
    \ Therefore, we need to fragment the IPv6\npacket. This is done by the adaptation\
    \ layer.\n(iii) Link layer forwarding 6LoWPAN also supports mesh\nunder routing,\
    \ which is done at the link layer using\nlink level short addresses instead of\
    \ in the network\nlayer. This feature can be used to communicate within\na 6LoWPAN\
    \ network.\n(3) Network Layer. The network layer is responsible for\nrouting the\
    \ packets received from the transport layer. The\nIETF Routing over Low Power\
    \ and Lossy Networks (ROLL)\nworking group has developed a routing protocol (RPL)\
    \ for\nLow Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [53].\nFor such networks, RPL is an\
    \ open routing protocol,\nbased on distance vectors. It describes how a destination\n\
    oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) is built with\nthe nodes after they exchange\
    \ distance vectors. A set of\nconstraints and an objective function is used to\
    \ build the\ngraph with the best path [53]. The objective function and\nconstraints\
    \ may differ with respect to their requirements. For\nexample, constraints can\
    \ be to avoid battery powered nodes\nor to prefer encrypted links. The objective\
    \ function can aim\nto minimize the latency or the expected number of packets\n\
    that need to be sent.\nThe making of this graph starts from the root node. The\n\
    root starts sending messages to neighboring nodes, which\nthen process the message\
    \ and decide whether to join or not\ndepending upon the constraints and the objective\
    \ function.\nSubsequently, they forward the message to their neighbors.\nIn this\
    \ manner, the message travels till the leaf nodes and a\ngraph is formed. Now\
    \ all the nodes in the graph can send\npackets upwards hop by hop to the root.\
    \ We can realize a point\nto point routing algorithm as follows. We send packets\
    \ to a\ncommon ancestor, from which it travels downwards (towards\nleaves) to\
    \ reach the destination.\nTo manage the memory requirements of nodes, nodes are\n\
    classified into storing and nonstoring nodes depending upon\ntheir ability to\
    \ store routing information. When nodes are in a\nnonstoring mode and a downward\
    \ path is being constructed,\nthe route information is attached to the incoming\
    \ message\nand forwarded further till the root. The root receives the\nwhole path\
    \ in the message and sends a data packet along with\nthe path message to the destination\
    \ hop by hop. But there is\na trade-off here because nonstoring nodes need more\
    \ power\nand bandwidth to send additional route information as they\ndo not have\
    \ the memory to store routing tables.\n(4) Transport Layer. TCP is not a good\
    \ option for communi-\ncation in low power environments as it has a large overhead\n\
    owing to the fact that it is a connection oriented protocol.\nTherefore, UDP is\
    \ preferred because it is a connectionless\nprotocol and has low overhead.\n(5)\
    \ Application Layer. The application layer is responsible for\ndata formatting\
    \ and presentation. The application layer in\nthe Internet is typically based\
    \ on HTTP. However, HTTP is\nnot suitable in resource constrained environments\
    \ because\nit is fairly verbose in nature and thus incurs a large parsing\noverhead.\
    \ Many alternate protocols have been developed for\nIoT environments such as CoAP\
    \ (Constrained Application\nProtocol) and MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport).\n\
    (a) Constrained Application Protocol: CoAP can be\nthought of as an alternative\
    \ to HTTP. It is used\nin most IoT applications [56, 57]. Unlike HTTP, it\nincorporates\
    \ optimizations for constrained applica-\ntion environments [50]. It uses the\
    \ EXI (Efficient\nXML Interchanges) data format, which is a binary\ndata format\
    \ and is far more efficient in terms of\nspace as compared to plain text HTML/XML.\
    \ Other\nsupported features are built in header compression,\nresource discovery,\
    \ autoconfiguration, asynchronous\nmessage exchange, congestion control, and support\n\
    for multicast messages. There are four types of mes-\nsages in CoAP: nonconfirmable,\
    \ confirmable, reset\n(nack), and acknowledgement. For reliable transmis-\nsion\
    \ over UDP, confirmable messages are used [58].\nThe response can be piggybacked\
    \ in the acknowledge-\nment itself. Furthermore, it uses DTLS (Datagram\nTransport\
    \ Layer Security) for security purposes.\n(b) Message Queue Telemetry Transport:\
    \ MQTT is a\npublish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. It was\ndeveloped\
    \ by IBM [59] primarily as a client/server\nprotocol. The clients are publishers/subscribers\
    \ and\nthe server acts as a broker to which clients connect\nthrough TCP. Clients\
    \ can publish or subscribe to a\ntopic. This communication takes place through\
    \ the\nbroker whose job is to coordinate subscriptions and\nalso authenticate\
    \ the client for security. MQTT is\na lightweight protocol, which makes it suitable\
    \ for\nIoT applications. But because of the fact that it runs\nover TCP, it cannot\
    \ be used with all types of IoT\napplications. Moreover, it uses text for topic\
    \ names,\nwhich increases its overhead.\nMQTT-S/MQTT-SN is an extension of MQTT\
    \ [60],\nwhich is designed for low power and low cost devices. It is\nbased on\
    \ MQTT but has some optimizations for WSNs as\nfollows [61]. The topic names are\
    \ replaced by topic IDs, which\nreduce the overheads of transmission. Topics do\
    \ not need\nregistration as they are preregistered. Messages are also split\n\
    so that only the necessary information is sent. Further, for\npower conservation,\
    \ there is an offline procedure for clients\nwho are in a sleep state. Messages\
    \ can be buffered and later\nread by clients when they wake up. Clients connect\
    \ to the\nbroker through a gateway device, which resides within the\nsensor network\
    \ and connects to the broker.\n7.4. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bluetooth Low\
    \ Energy, also\nknown as “Bluetooth Smart,” was developed by the Bluetooth\nJournal\
    \ of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n13\nSpecial Interest Group. It has a\
    \ relatively shorter range and\nconsumes lower energy as compared to competing\
    \ protocols.\nThe BLE protocol stack is similar to the stack used in classic\n\
    Bluetooth technology. It has two parts: controller and host.\nThe physical and\
    \ link layer are implemented in the controller.\nThe controller is typically a\
    \ SOC (System on Chip) with a\nradio. The functionalities of upper layers are\
    \ included in the\nhost [62]. BLE is not compatible with classic Bluetooth. Let\n\
    us look at the differences between classic Bluetooth and BLE\n[63, 64].\nThe main\
    \ difference is that BLE does not support data\nstreaming. Instead, it supports\
    \ quick transfer of small packets\nof data (packet size is small) with a data\
    \ rate of 1 Mbps.\nThere are two types of devices in BLE: master and slave.\n\
    The master acts as a central device that can connect to various\nslaves. Let us\
    \ consider an IoT scenario where a phone or PC\nserve as the master and mobile\
    \ devices such as a thermostat,\nfitness tracker, smart watch, or any monitoring\
    \ device act\nas slaves. In such cases, slaves must be very power efficient.\n\
    Therefore, to save energy, slaves are by default in sleep mode\nand wake up periodically\
    \ to receive packets from the master.\nIn classic Bluetooth, the connection is\
    \ on all the time even\nif no data transfer is going on. Additionally, it supports\
    \ 79\ndata channels (1 MHz channel bandwidth) and a data rate\nof 1 million symbols/s,\
    \ whereas, BLE supports 40 channels\nwith 2 MHz channel bandwidth (double of classic\
    \ Bluetooth)\nand 1 million symbols/s data rate. BLE supports low duty\ncycle\
    \ requirements as its packet size is small and the time\ntaken to transmit the\
    \ smallest packet is as small as 80 \U0001D707s. The\nBLE protocol stack supports\
    \ IP based communication also.\nAn experiment conducted by Siekkinen et al. [65]\
    \ recorded\nthe number of bytes transferred per Joule to show that BLE\nconsumes\
    \ far less energy as compared to competing protocols\nsuch as Zigbee. The energy\
    \ efficiency of BLE is 2.5 times better\nthan Zigbee.\n7.5. Low Power WiFi. The\
    \ WiFi alliance has recently devel-\noped “WiFi HaLow,” which is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11ah\nstandard. It consumes lower power than a traditional WiFi\ndevice\
    \ and also has a longer range. This is why this protocol\nis suitable for Internet\
    \ of Things applications. The range of\nWiFi HaLow is nearly twice that of traditional\
    \ WiFi.\nLike other WiFi devices, devices supporting WiFi HaLow\nalso support\
    \ IP connectivity, which is important for IoT\napplications. Let us look at the\
    \ specifications of the IEEE\n802.11ah standard [66, 67]. This standard was developed\
    \ to\ndeal with wireless sensor network scenarios, where devices\nare energy constrained\
    \ and require relatively long range\ncommunication. IEEE 802.11ah operates in\
    \ the sub-gigahertz\nband (900 MHz). Because of the relatively lower frequency,\n\
    the range is longer since higher frequency waves suffer from\nhigher attenuation.\
    \ We can extend the range (currently 1 km)\nby lowering the frequency further;\
    \ however, the data rate\nwill also be lower and thus the tradeoff is not justified.\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah is also designed to support large star shaped\nnetworks, where a\
    \ lot of stations are connected to a single\naccess point.\n7.6. Zigbee. It is\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.15.4 communication\nprotocol standard and is used for\
    \ personal area networks\nor PANs [68]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has low power\n\
    MAC and physical layers and has already been explained\nin Section 7.3. Zigbee\
    \ was developed by the Zigbee alliance,\nwhich works for reliable, low energy,\
    \ and cheap communi-\ncation solutions. The range of Zigbee device communication\n\
    is very small (10–100 meters). The details of the network and\napplication layers\
    \ are also specified by the Zigbee standard.\nUnlike BLE, the network layer here\
    \ provides for multihop\nrouting.\nThere are three types of devices in a Zigbee\
    \ network:\nFFD (Fully Functional Device), RFD (Reduced Functional\nDevice), and\
    \ one Zigbee coordinator. A FFD node can addi-\ntionally act as a router. Zigbee\
    \ supports star, tree, and mesh\ntopologies. The routing scheme depends on the\
    \ topology.\nOther features of Zigbee are discovery and maintenance of\nroutes,\
    \ support for nodes joining/leaving the network, short\n16-bit addresses, and\
    \ multihop routing.\nThe framework for communication and distributed appli-\n\
    cation development is provided by the application layer.\nThe application layer\
    \ consists of Application Objects (APO),\nApplication Sublayer (APS), and a Zigbee\
    \ Device Object\n(ZDO). APOs are spread over the network nodes. These are\npieces\
    \ of software, which control some underlying device\nhardware (examples: switch\
    \ and transducer). The device and\nnetwork management services are provided by\
    \ the ZDO,\nwhich are then used by the APOs. Data transfer services\nare provided\
    \ by the Application Sublayer to the APOs and\nZDO. It is responsible for secure\
    \ communication between the\nApplication Objects. These features can be used to\
    \ create a\nlarge distributed application.\n7.7. Integration of RFID and WSN.\
    \ RFID and wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) are both important technologies in\
    \ the IoT\ndomain. RFID can only be used for object identification, but\nWSNs\
    \ serve a far greater purpose. The two are very different\nbut merging them has\
    \ many advantages. The following\ncomponents can be added to RFID to enhance its\
    \ usability:\n(a) Sensing capabilities\n(b) Multihop communication\n(c) Intelligence\n\
    RFID is inexpensive and uses very little power. That is\nwhy its integration with\
    \ WSN is very useful. The integration\nis possible in the following ways [69,\
    \ 70]:\n(a) Integration of RFID tags with sensors: RFID tags\nwith sensing capabilities\
    \ are called sensor tags. These\nsensor tags sense data from the environment and\n\
    then the RFID reader can read this sensed data from\nthe tag. In such cases, simple\
    \ RFID protocols are\nused, where there is only single hop communication.\nRFID\
    \ sensing technologies can be further classified\non the basis of the power requirement\
    \ of sensor tags as\nexplained earlier in the section on RFIDs (active and\npassive)\
    \ (see Section 5.5).\n14\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n(b)\
    \ Integration of RFID tags with WSN nodes: the com-\nmunication capabilities of\
    \ sensor tags are limited to a\nsingle hop. To extend its capabilities, the sensor\
    \ tag is\nequipped with a wireless transceiver, little bit of Flash\nmemory, and\
    \ computational capabilities such that it\ncan initiate communication with other\
    \ nodes and\nwireless devices. The nodes can in this fashion be used\nto form\
    \ a wireless mesh network. In such networks,\nsensor tags can communicate with\
    \ each other over a\nlarge range (via intermediate hops). With additional\nprocessing\
    \ capabilities at a node, we can reduce the\nnet amount of data communicated and\
    \ thus increase\nthe power efficiency of the WSN.\n(c) Integration of RFID readers\
    \ with WSN nodes: this\ntype of integration is also done to increase the range\n\
    of RFID tag readers. The readers are equipped with\nwireless transceivers and\
    \ microcontrollers so that\nthey can communicate with each other and therefore,\n\
    the tag data can reach a reader, which is not in the\nrange of that tag. It takes\
    \ advantage of multihop\ncommunication of wireless sensor network devices.\nThe\
    \ data from all the RFID readers in the network\nultimately reaches a central\
    \ gateway or base station\nthat processes the data or sends it to a remote server.\n\
    These kinds of integrated solutions have many applica-\ntions in a diverse set\
    \ of domains such as security, healthcare,\nand manufacturing.\n7.8. Low Power\
    \ Wide-Area-Networks (LPWAN). Let us now\ndiscuss a protocol for long range communication\
    \ in power\nconstrained devices. The LPWAN class of protocols is low bit-\nrate\
    \ communication technologies for such IoT scenarios.\nLet us now discuss some\
    \ of the most common technolo-\ngies in this area.\nNarrow band IoT: it is a technology\
    \ made for a large\nnumber of devices that are energy constrained. It is\nthus\
    \ necessary to reduce the bit rate. This protocol\ncan be deployed with both the\
    \ cellular phone GSM\nand LTE spectra. The downlink speeds vary between\n40 kbps\
    \ (LTE M2) and 10 Mbps (LTE category 1).\nSigfox: it is one more protocol that\
    \ uses narrow band\ncommunication (≈10 MHz). It uses free sections of\nthe radio\
    \ spectrum (ISM band) to transmit its data.\nInstead of 4G networks, Sigfox focuses\
    \ on using\nvery long waves. Thus, the range can increase to a\n1000 kms. Because\
    \ of this the energy for transmission\nis significantly lower (<0.1%) than contemporary\
    \ cell\nphones.\nAgain the cost is bandwidth. It can only transmit\n12 bytes per\
    \ message, and a device is limited to 140\nmessages per day. This is reasonable\
    \ for many kinds of\napplications: submarine applications, sending control\n(emergency)\
    \ codes, geolocation, monitoring remote\nlocations, and medical applications.\n\
    Weightless: it uses a differential binary phase shift\nkeying based method to\
    \ transmit narrow band sig-\nnals. To avoid interference, the protocol hops across\n\
    frequency bands (instead of using CSMA). It sup-\nports cryptographic encryption\
    \ and mobility. Along\nwith frequency hopping, two additional mechanisms\nare\
    \ used to reduce collisions. The downlink service\nuses time division multiple\
    \ access (TDMA) and the\nuplink service uses multiple subchannels that are first\n\
    allocated to transmitting nodes by contacting a cen-\ntral server. Some applications\
    \ include smart meters,\nvehicle tracking, health monitoring, and industrial\n\
    machine monitoring.\nNeul: this protocol operates in the sub-1 GHz band.\nIt uses\
    \ small chunks of the TV whitespace spectrum\nto create low cost and low power\
    \ networks with very\nhigh scalability. It has a 10 km range and uses the\nWeightless\
    \ protocol for communication.\nLoRaWAN: this protocol is similar to Sigfox. It\
    \ targets\nwide area network applications and is designed to be\na low power protocol.\
    \ Its data rates can vary from\n0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, and it can be used within\
    \ an\nurban or a suburban environment (2–5 kms range\nin a crowded urban area).\
    \ It was designed to serve\nas a standard for long range IoT protocols. It thus\n\
    has features to support multitenancy, enable multiple\napplications, and include\
    \ several different network\ndomains.\n7.9. Lightweight Application Layer Protocols.\
    \ Along with\nphysical and MAC layer protocols, we also need application\nlayer\
    \ protocols for IoT networks. These lightweight protocols\nneed to be able to\
    \ carry application messages, while simulta-\nneously reducing power as far as\
    \ possible.\nOMA Lightweight M2M (LWM2M) is one such protocol.\nIt defines the\
    \ communication protocol between a server and\na device. The devices often have\
    \ limited capabilities and are\nthus referred to as constrained devices. The main\
    \ aims of the\nOMA protocol are as follows:\n(1) Remote device management.\n(2)\
    \ Transferring service data/information between differ-\nent nodes in the LWM2M\
    \ network.\nAll the protocols in this class treat all the network\nresources as\
    \ objects. Such resources can be created, deleted,\nand remotely configured. These\
    \ devices have their unique\nlimitations and can use different kinds of protocols\
    \ for\ninternally representing information. The LWM2M protocol\nabstracts all\
    \ of this away and provides a convenient interface\nto send messages between a\
    \ generic LWM2M server and a\ndistributed set of LWM2M clients.\nThis protocol\
    \ is often used along with CoAP (Constrained\nApplication Protocol). It is an\
    \ application layer protocol\nthat allows constrained nodes such as sensor motes\
    \ or small\nembedded devices to communicate across the Internet. CoAP\nseamlessly\
    \ integrates with HTTP, yet it provides additional\nfacilities such as support\
    \ for multicast operations. It is ideally\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\n15\nsuited for small devices because of its low overhead and\n\
    parsing complexity and reliance on UDP rather than TCP.\n8. Middleware\nUbiquitous\
    \ computing is the core of the Internet of Things,\nwhich means incorporating\
    \ computing and connectivity in\nall the things around us. Interoperability of\
    \ such heteroge-\nneous devices needs well-defined standards. But standard-\n\
    ization is difficult because of the varied requirements of\ndifferent applications\
    \ and devices. For such heterogeneous\napplications, the solution is to have a\
    \ middleware platform,\nwhich will abstract the details of the things for applications.\n\
    That is, it will hide the details of the smart things. It\nshould act as a software\
    \ bridge between the things and the\napplications. It needs to provide the required\
    \ services to the\napplication developers [20] so that they can focus more on\n\
    the requirements of applications rather than on interacting\nwith the baseline\
    \ hardware. To summarize, the middleware\nabstracts the hardware and provides\
    \ an Application Program-\nming Interface (API) for communication, data management,\n\
    computation, security, and privacy.\nThe challenges, which are addressed by any\
    \ IoT middle-\nware, are as follows: [20, 71, 72].\n(1) Interoperability and programming\
    \ abstractions: for\nfacilitating collaboration and information exchange\nbetween\
    \ heterogeneous devices, different types of\nthings can interact with each other\
    \ easily with the help\nof middleware services. Interoperability is of three\n\
    types: network, semantic, and syntactic. Network\ninteroperability deals with\
    \ heterogeneous interface\nprotocols for communication between devices. It\ninsulates\
    \ the applications from the intricacies of\ndifferent protocols. Syntactic interoperability\
    \ ensures\nthat applications are oblivious of different formats,\nstructures,\
    \ and encoding of data. Semantic interop-\nerability deals with abstracting the\
    \ meaning of data\nwithin a particular domain. It is loosely inspired by\nthe\
    \ semantic web.\n(2) Device discovery and management: this feature\nenables the\
    \ devices to be aware of all other devices\nin the neighborhood and the services\
    \ provided by\nthem. In the Internet of Things, the infrastructure is\nmostly\
    \ dynamic. The devices have to announce their\npresence and the services they\
    \ provide. The solution\nneeds to be scalable because the devices in an IoT\n\
    network can increase. Most solutions in this domain\nare loosely inspired by semantic\
    \ web technologies.\nThe middleware provides APIs to list the IoT devices,\ntheir\
    \ services, and capabilities. In addition, typically\nAPIs are provided to discover\
    \ devices based on their\ncapabilities. Finally, any IoT middleware needs to\n\
    perform load balancing, manage devices based on\ntheir levels of battery power,\
    \ and report problems in\ndevices to the users.\n(3) Scalability: a large number\
    \ of devices are expected to\ncommunicate in an IoT setup. Moreover, IoT appli-\n\
    cations need to scale due to ever increasing require-\nments. This should be managed\
    \ by the middleware\nby making required changes when the infrastructure\nscales.\n\
    (4) Big data and analytics: IoT sensors typically collect\na huge amount of data.\
    \ It is necessary to analyze\nall of this data in great detail. As a result a\
    \ lot of\nbig data algorithms are used to analyze IoT data.\nMoreover, it is possible\
    \ that due to the flimsy nature\nof the network some of the data collected might\
    \ be\nincomplete. It is necessary to take this into account\nand extrapolate data\
    \ by using sophisticated machine\nlearning algorithms.\n(5) Security and privacy:\
    \ IoT applications are mostly\nrelated to someone’s personal life or an industry.\n\
    Security and privacy issues need to be addressed in\nall such environments. The\
    \ middleware should have\nbuilt in mechanisms to address such issues, along with\n\
    user authentication, and the implementation of access\ncontrol.\n(6) Cloud services:\
    \ the cloud is an important part of an\nIoT deployment. Most of the sensor data\
    \ is analyzed\nand stored in a centralized cloud. It is necessary for\nIoT middleware\
    \ to seamlessly run on different types\nof clouds and to enable users to leverage\
    \ the cloud\nto get better insights from the data collected by the\nsensors.\n\
    (7) Context detection: the data collected from the sensors\nneeds to be used to\
    \ extract the context by applying\nvarious types of algorithms. The context can\
    \ subse-\nquently be used for providing sophisticated services\nto users.\nThere\
    \ are many middleware solutions available for the\nInternet of Things, which address\
    \ one or more of the\naforementioned issues. All of them support interoperabil-\n\
    ity and abstraction, which is the foremost requirement of\nmiddleware. Some examples\
    \ are Oracle’s Fusion Middleware,\nOpenIoT [21], MiddleWhere [22], and Hydra [23].\
    \ Middle-\nwares can be classified as follows on the basis of their design\n[72]:\n\
    (1) Event based: here, all the components interact with\neach other through events.\
    \ Each event has a type and\nsome parameters. Events are generated by producers\n\
    and received by the consumers. This can be viewed\nas a publish/subscribe architecture,\
    \ where entities can\nsubscribe for some event types and get notified for\nthose\
    \ events.\n(2) Service oriented: service oriented middlewares are\nbased on Service\
    \ Oriented Architectures (SOA), in\nwhich we have independent modules that provide\
    \ ser-\nvices through accessible interfaces. A service oriented\nmiddleware views\
    \ resources as service providers.\nIt abstracts the underlying resources through\
    \ a set\nof services that are used by applications. There is\n16\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\na service repository, where services are published\n\
    by providers. The consumers can discover services\nfrom the repository and then\
    \ bind with the provider\nto access the service. Service oriented middleware\n\
    must have runtime support for advertising services\nby providers and support for\
    \ discovering and using\nservices by consumers.\nHYDRA [23] is a service oriented\
    \ middleware. It\nincorporates many software components, which are\nused in handling\
    \ various tasks required for the devel-\nopment of intelligent applications. Hydra\
    \ also pro-\nvides semantic interoperability using semantic web\ntechnologies.\
    \ It supports dynamic reconfiguration\nand self-management.\n(3) Database oriented:\
    \ in this approach, the network\nof IoT devices is considered as a virtual relational\n\
    database system. The database can then be queried\nby the applications using a\
    \ query language. There\nare easy to use interfaces for extracting data from\n\
    the database. This approach has issues with scaling\nbecause of its centralized\
    \ model.\n(4) Semantic: semantic middleware focuses on the inter-\noperation of\
    \ different types of devices, which commu-\nnicate using different formats of\
    \ data. It incorporates\ndevices with different data formats and ontologies and\n\
    ties all of them together in a common framework.\nThe framework is used for exchanging\
    \ data between\ndiverse types of devices. For a common semantic for-\nmat, we\
    \ need to have \U0001D441 adapters for communication\nbetween \U0001D441 devices\
    \ because; for each device, we need\nadapters to map \U0001D441 standards to one\
    \ abstract standard\n[73]. In such a semantic middleware [74], a semantic\nlayer\
    \ is introduced, in which there is a mapping from\neach resource to a software\
    \ layer for that resource.\nThe software layers then communicate with each\nother\
    \ using a mutually intelligible language (based\non the semantic web). This technique\
    \ allows multiple\nphysical resources to communicate even though they\ndo not\
    \ implement or understand the same protocols.\n(5) Application specific: this\
    \ type of middleware is used\nspecifically for an application domain for which\
    \ it\nis developed because the whole architecture of this\nmiddleware software\
    \ is fine-tuned on the basis of\nrequirements of the application. The application\
    \ and\nmiddleware are tightly coupled. These are not general\npurpose solutions.\n\
    8.1. Popular IoT Middleware\n8.1.1. FiWare. FiWare is a very popular IoT middleware\n\
    framework that is promoted by the EU. It has been designed\nkeeping smart cities,\
    \ logistics, and shop floor analytics in\nmind. FiWare contains a large body of\
    \ code, reusable mod-\nules, and APIs that have been contributed by thousands\
    \ of\nFiWare developers. Any application developer can take a\nsubset of these\
    \ components and build his/her IoT application.\nA typical IoT application has\
    \ many producers of data\n(sensors), a set of servers to process the data, and\
    \ a set\nof actuators. FiWare refers to the information collected by\nsensors\
    \ as context information. It defines generic REST APIs\nto capture the context\
    \ from different scenarios. All the context\ninformation is sent to a dedicated\
    \ service called a context\nbroker. FiWare provides APIs to store the context\
    \ and also\nquery it. Moreover, any application can register itself as a\ncontext\
    \ consumer, and it can request the context broker for\ninformation. It also supports\
    \ the publish-subscribe paradigm.\nSubsequently, the context can be supplied to\
    \ systems using\ncontext adapters whose main role is to transform the data (the\n\
    context) based on the requirements of the destination nodes.\nMoreover, FiWare\
    \ defines a set of SNMP APIs via which we\ncan control the behavior of IoT devices\
    \ and also configure\nthem.\nThe target applications are provided APIs to analyze,\n\
    query, and mine the information that is collected from the\ncontext broker. Additionally,\
    \ with advanced visualization\nAPIs, it is possible to create and deploy feature\
    \ rich applica-\ntions very quickly.\n8.1.2. OpenIoT. OpenIoT is another popular\
    \ open source\ninitiative. It has 7 different components. At the lowest level,\n\
    we have a physical plane. It collects data from IoT devices\nand also does some\
    \ preprocessing of data. It has different\nAPIs to interface with different types\
    \ of physical nodes and\nget information from them.\nThe next plane is the virtualized\
    \ plane, which has 3\ncomponents. We first have the scheduler, which manages the\n\
    streams of data generated by devices. It primarily assigns\nthem to resources\
    \ and takes care of their QoS requirements.\nThe data storage component manages\
    \ the storage and archival\nof data streams. Finally, the service delivery component\n\
    processes the streams. It has several roles. It combines\ndata streams, preprocesses\
    \ them, and tracks some statistics\nassociated with these streams such as the\
    \ number of unique\nrequests or the size of each request.\nThe uppermost layer,\
    \ that is, the application layer, also\nhas 3 components: request definition,\
    \ request presentation,\nand configuration. The request definition component helps\n\
    us create requests to be sent to the IoT sensors and storage\nlayers. It can be\
    \ used to fetch and query data. The request\npresentation component creates mashups\
    \ of data by issuing\ndifferent queries to the storage layer, and finally the\
    \ configu-\nration component helps us configure the IoT devices.\n9. Applications\
    \ of IoT\nThere are a diverse set of areas in which intelligent applica-\ntions\
    \ have been developed. All of these applications are not\nyet readily available;\
    \ however, preliminary research indicates\nthe potential of IoT in improving the\
    \ quality of life in our soci-\nety. Some uses of IoT applications are in home\
    \ automation,\nfitness tracking, health monitoring, environment protection,\n\
    smart cities, and industrial settings.\n9.1. Home Automation. Smart homes are\
    \ becoming more\npopular today because of two reasons. First, the sensor\nand\
    \ actuation technologies along with wireless sensor net-\nworks have significantly\
    \ matured. Second, people today trust\nJournal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\

    \ diagram of a smart home system.\ntechnology to address their concerns about\
    \ their quality of\nlife and security of their homes (see Figure 8).\nIn smart\
    \ homes, various sensors are deployed, which\nprovide intelligent and automated\
    \ services to the user. They\nhelp in automating daily tasks and help in maintaining\
    \ a\nroutine for individuals who tend to be forgetful. They help\nin energy conservation\
    \ by turning off lights and electronic\ngadgets automatically. We typically use\
    \ motion sensors for\nthis purpose. Motion sensors can be additionally used for\n\
    security also.\nFor example, the project, MavHome [75], provides an\nintelligent\
    \ agent, which uses various prediction algorithms\nfor doing automated tasks in\
    \ response to user triggered events\nand adapts itself to the routines of the\
    \ inhabitants. Predic-\ntion algorithms are used to predict the sequence of events\n\
    [76] in a home. A sequence matching algorithm maintains\nsequences of events in\
    \ a queue and also stores their frequency.\nThen a prediction is made using the\
    \ match length and\nfrequency. Other algorithms used by similar applications use\n\
    compression based prediction and Markov models.\nEnergy conservation in smart\
    \ homes [77] is typically\nachieved through sensors and context awareness. The\
    \ sen-\nsors collect data from the environment (light, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ gas, and fire events). This data from heterogeneous\nsensors is fed to a context\
    \ aggregator, which forwards the\ncollected data to the context aware service\
    \ engine. This engine\nselects services based on the context. For example, an\
    \ appli-\ncation can automatically turn on the AC when the humidity\nrises. Or,\
    \ when there is a gas leak, it can turn all the lights off.\nSmart home applications\
    \ are really beneficial for the\nelderly and differently abled. Their health is\
    \ monitored and\nrelatives are informed immediately in case of emergencies.\n\
    Floors are equipped with pressure sensors, which track the\nmovement of an individual\
    \ across the smart home and also\nhelp in detecting if a person has fallen down.\
    \ In smart homes,\nCCTV cameras can be used to record events of interest. These\n\
    can then be used for feature extraction to find out what is\ngoing on.\nIn specific,\
    \ fall detection applications in smart environ-\nments [78–80] are useful for\
    \ detecting if elderly people have\nfallen down. Yu et al. [80] use computer vision\
    \ based tech-\nniques for analyzing postures of the human body. Sixsmith\net al.\
    \ [79] used low cost infrared sensor array technology,\nwhich can provide information\
    \ such as the location, size,\nand velocity of a target object. It detects dynamics\
    \ of a fall\nby analyzing the motion patterns and also detects inactivity\nand\
    \ compares it with activity in the past. Neural networks\nare employed and sample\
    \ data is provided to the system for\nvarious types of falls. Many smartphone\
    \ based applications\nare also available, which detect a fall on the basis of\
    \ readings\nfrom the accelerometer and gyroscope data.\nThere are many challenges\
    \ and issues with regard to smart\nhome applications [81]. The most important\
    \ is security and\nprivacy [82] since all the data about the events taking place\
    \ in\nthe home is being recorded. If the security and trustworthi-\nness of the\
    \ system are not guaranteed, an intruder may attack\nthe system and may make the\
    \ system behave maliciously.\nSmart home systems are supposed to notify the owners\
    \ in case\nthey detect such abnormalities. This is possible using AI and\nmachine\
    \ learning algorithms, and researchers have already\nstarted working in this direction\
    \ [83]. Reliability is also an\nissue since there is no system administrator to\
    \ monitor the\nsystem.\n9.2. Smart Cities\n9.2.1. Smart Transport. Smart transport\
    \ applications can\nmanage daily traffic in cities using sensors and intelligent\n\
    information processing systems. The main aim of intelligent\ntransport systems\
    \ is to minimize traffic congestion, ensure\n18\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\
    \ Engineering\nDatacenter\nGateway\nSend status to cloud\nabout availability\n\
    Search for nearest\navailable parking\nParking space with sensors\nFigure 9: Block\
    \ diagram of a smart parking system.\neasy and hassle-free parking, and avoid\
    \ accidents by prop-\nerly routing traffic and spotting drunk drivers. The sensor\n\
    technologies governing these types of applications are GPS\nsensors for location,\
    \ accelerometers for speed, gyroscopes for\ndirection, RFIDs for vehicle identification,\
    \ infrared sensors\nfor counting passengers and vehicles, and cameras for record-\n\
    ing vehicle movement and traffic. There are many types of\napplications in this\
    \ area (refer to [84]):\n(1) Traffic surveillance and management applications:\n\
    vehicles are connected by a network to each other,\nthe cloud, and to a host of\
    \ IoT devices such as GPS\nsensors, RFID devices, and cameras. These devices\n\
    can estimate traffic conditions in different parts of the\ncity. Custom applications\
    \ can analyze traffic patterns\nso that future traffic conditions can be estimated.\
    \ Yu et\nal. [85] implement a vehicle tracking system for traffic\nsurveillance\
    \ using video sequences captured on the\nroads.\nTraffic congestion detection\
    \ can also be implemented\nusing smartphone sensors such as accelerometers\n[86]\
    \ and GPS sensors. These applications can detect\nmovement patterns of the vehicle\
    \ while the user is\ndriving. Such kind of information is already being\ncollected\
    \ by Google maps and users are using it to\nroute around potentially congested\
    \ areas of the city.\n(2) Applications to ensure safety: smart transport does\n\
    not only imply managing traffic conditions. It also\nincludes safety of people\
    \ travelling in their vehicles,\nwhich up till now was mainly in the hands of\
    \ drivers.\nThere are many IoT applications developed to help\ndrivers become\
    \ safer drivers. Such applications mon-\nitor driving behavior of drivers and\
    \ help them drive\nsafely by detecting when they are feeling drowsy or\ntired\
    \ and helping them to cope with it or suggesting\nrest [87, 88]. Technologies\
    \ used in such applications\nare face detection, eye movement detection, and\n\
    pressure detection on the steering (to measure the\ngrip of the driver’s hands\
    \ on the steering).\nA smartphone application, which estimates the\ndriver’s driving\
    \ behavior using smartphone sensors\nsuch as the accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS,\
    \ and cam-\nera, has been proposed by Eren et al. [89]. It can\ndecide whether\
    \ the driving is safe or rash by analyzing\nthe sensor data.\n(3) Intelligent\
    \ parking management (see Figure 9): in a\nsmart transportation system, parking\
    \ is completely\nhassle free as one can easily check on the Internet to\nfind\
    \ out which parking lot has free spaces. Such lots\nuse sensors to detect if the\
    \ slots are free or occupied by\nvehicles. This data is then uploaded to a central\
    \ server.\n(4) Smart traffic lights: traffic lights equipped with sens-\ning,\
    \ processing, and communication capabilities are\ncalled smart traffic lights.\
    \ These lights sense the\ntraffic congestion at the intersection and the amount\n\
    of traffic going each way. This information can be\nanalyzed and then sent to\
    \ neighboring traffic lights\nor a central controller. It is possible to use this\n\
    information creatively. For example, in an emergency\nsituation the traffic lights\
    \ can preferentially give way\nto an ambulance. When the smart traffic light senses\n\
    an ambulance coming, it clears the path for it and\nalso informs neighboring lights\
    \ about it. Technologies\nused in these lights are cameras, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, and data analysis modules. Such systems\nhave already been deployed\
    \ in Rio De Janeiro.\n(5) Accident detection applications: a smartphone appli-\n\
    cation designed by White et al. [90] detects the occur-\nrence of an accident\
    \ with the help of an accelerometer\nand acoustic data. It immediately sends this\
    \ informa-\ntion along with the location to the nearest hospital.\nJournal of\
    \ Electrical and Computer Engineering\n19\nSome additional situational information\
    \ such as on-\nsite photographs is also sent so that the first respon-\nders know\
    \ about the whole scenario and the degree of\nmedical help that is required.\n\
    9.2.2. Smart Water Systems. Given the prevailing amount of\nwater scarcity in\
    \ most parts of the world, it is very important\nto manage our water resources\
    \ efficiently. As a result most\ncities are opting for smart solutions that place\
    \ a lot of meters\non water supply lines and storm drains. A good reference\n\
    in this area is the paper by Hauber-Davidson and Idris [91].\nThey describe various\
    \ designs for smart water meters. These\nmeters can be used to measure the degree\
    \ of water inflow and\noutflow and to identify possible leaks. Smart water metering\n\
    systems are also used in conjunction with data from weather\nsatellites and river\
    \ water sensors. They can also help us predict\nflooding.\n9.2.3. Examples of\
    \ Smart Cities. Barcelona and Stockholm\nstand out in the list of smart cities.\
    \ Barcelona has a CityOS\nproject, where it aims to create a single virtualized\
    \ OS for\nall the smart devices and services offered within the city.\nBarcelona\
    \ has mainly focused on smart transportation (as\ndiscussed in Section 9.2.1)\
    \ and smart water. Smart transporta-\ntion is implemented using a network of sensors,\
    \ centralized\nanalysis, and smart traffic lights. On similar lines Barcelona\n\
    has sensors on most of its storm drains, water storage tanks,\nand water supply\
    \ lines. This information is integrated with\nweather and usage information. The\
    \ result of all of this is\na centralized water planning strategy. The city is\
    \ able to\nestimate the water requirements in terms of domestic usage\nand industrial\
    \ usage and for activities such as landscaping and\ngardening.\nStockholm started\
    \ way back in 1994, and its first step in\nthis direction was to install an extensive\
    \ fiber optic system.\nSubsequently, the city added thousands of sensors for smart\n\
    traffic and smart water management applications. Stockholm\nwas one of the first\
    \ cities to implement congestion charging.\nUsers were charged money, when they\
    \ drove into congested\nareas. This was enabled by smart traffic technologies.\
    \ Since\nthe city has a solid network backbone, it is very easy to\ndeploy sensors\
    \ and applications. For example, recently the\ncity created a smart parking system,\
    \ where it is possible to\neasily locate parking spots nearby. Parking lots have\
    \ sensors,\nwhich let a server know about their usage. Once a driver\nqueries\
    \ the server with her/his GPS location, she/he is guided\nto the nearest parking\
    \ lot with free slots. Similar innovations\nhave taken place in the city’s smart\
    \ buildings, snow clearance,\nand political announcement systems.\n9.3. Social\
    \ Life and Entertainment. Social life and entertain-\nment play an important role\
    \ in an individual’s life. Many\napplications have been developed, which keep\
    \ track of such\nhuman activities. The term “opportunistic IoT” [92] refers\n\
    to information sharing among opportunistic devices (devices\nthat seek to make\
    \ contact with other devices) based on\nmovement and availability of contacts\
    \ in the vicinity. Personal\ndevices such as tablets, wearables, and mobile phones\
    \ have\nsensing and short range communication capabilities. People\ncan find and\
    \ interact with each other when there is a common\npurpose.\nCircle Sense [93]\
    \ is an application, which detects social\nactivities of a person with the help\
    \ of various types of sensor\ndata. It identifies the social circle of a person\
    \ by analyzing\nthe patterns of social activities and the people present in\n\
    those activities. Various types of social activities and the set\nof people participating\
    \ in those activities are identified. It\nuses location sensors to find out where\
    \ the person is and\nuses Bluetooth for searching people around her. The system\n\
    has built in machine learning algorithms, and it gradually\nimproves its behavior\
    \ with learning.\nAffective computing [94] is a technology, which recog-\nnizes,\
    \ understands, stimulates, and responds to the emotions\nof human beings. There\
    \ are many parameters, which are\nconsidered while dealing with human affects\
    \ such as facial\nexpressions, speech, body gestures, hand movements, and\nsleep\
    \ patterns. These are analyzed to figure out how a person\nis feeling. The utterance\
    \ of emotional keywords is identified\nby voice recognition and the quality of\
    \ voice by looking at\nacoustic features of speech.\nOne of the applications of\
    \ affective computing is Camy,\nan artificial pet dog [95], which is designed\
    \ to interact with\nhuman beings and show affection and emotions. Many sen-\n\
    sors and actuators are embedded in it. It provides emotional\nsupport to the owner,\
    \ encourages playful and active behavior,\nrecognizes its owner, and shows love\
    \ for her and increases\nthe owner’s communication with other people. Based on\
    \ the\nowner’s mood, Camy interacts with the owner and gives her\nsuggestions.\n\
    Logmusic [96] is an entertainment application, which\nrecommends music on the\
    \ basis of the context, such as the\nweather, temperature, time, and location.\n\
    9.4. Health and Fitness. IoT appliances have proven really\nbeneficial in the\
    \ health and wellness domains. Many wearable\ndevices are being developed, which\
    \ monitor a person’s health\ncondition (see Figure 10).\nHealth applications make\
    \ independent living possible for\nthe elderly and patients with serious health\
    \ conditions. Cur-\nrently, IoT sensors are being used to continuously monitor\n\
    and record their health conditions and transmit warnings in\ncase any abnormal\
    \ indicators are found. If there is a minor\nproblem, the IoT application itself\
    \ may suggest a prescription\nto the patient.\nIoT applications can be used in\
    \ creating an Electronic\nHealth Record (EHR), which is a record of all the medical\n\
    details of a person. It is maintained by the health system. An\nEHR can be used\
    \ to record allergies, surges in blood sugar\nand blood pressure.\nStress recognition\
    \ applications are also fairly popular\n[97]. They can be realized using smartphone\
    \ sensors. Wang\net al. describe an application [30], which measures the stress\n\
    level of a college student and is installed on the student’s\nsmartphone. It senses\
    \ the locations the student visits during\nthe whole day, the amount of physical\
    \ activity, amount of\nsleep and rest, and her/his interaction and relationships\
    \ with\nother people (audio data and calls). In addition, it also\nconducts surveys\
    \ with the student by randomly popping up\n20\nJournal of Electrical and Computer\

    \ of a smart healthcare system.\na question in the smartphone. Using all of this\
    \ data and\nanalyzing it intelligently, the level of stress and academic\nperformance\
    \ can be measured.\nIn the fitness sector, we have applications that monitor\n\
    how fit we are based on our daily activity level. Smartphone\naccelerometer data\
    \ can be used for activity detection by\napplying complex algorithms. For example,\
    \ we can measure\nthe number of steps taken and the amount of exercise done\n\
    by using fitness trackers. Fitness trackers are available in the\nmarket as wearables\
    \ to monitor the fitness level of an indi-\nvidual. In addition, gym apparatus\
    \ can be fitted with sensors\nto count the number of times an exercise is performed.\
    \ For\nexample, a smart mat [98] can count the number of exercise\nsteps performed\
    \ on it. This is implemented using pressure\nsensors on the mat and then by analyzing\
    \ the patterns of\npressure, and the shape of the contact area.\n9.5. Smart Environment\
    \ and Agriculture. Environmental\nparameters such as temperature and humidity\
    \ are important\nfor agricultural production. Sensors are used by farmers in\n\
    the field to measure such parameters and this data can be\nused for efficient\
    \ production. One application is automated\nirrigation according to weather conditions.\n\
    Production using greenhouses [99] is one of the main\napplications of IoT in agriculture.\
    \ Environmental parameters\nmeasured in terms of temperature, soil information,\
    \ and\nhumidity are measured in real time and sent to a server for\nanalysis.\
    \ The results are then used to improve crop quality and\nyield.\nPesticide residues\
    \ in crop production are detected using\nan Acetylcholinesterase biosensor [100].\
    \ This data is saved\nand analyzed for extracting useful information such as the\n\
    sample size, time, location, and amount of residues. We can\nJournal of Electrical\
    \ and Computer Engineering\n21\nthus maintain the quality of the crop. Moreover,\
    \ a QR code\ncan be used to uniquely identify a carton of farm produce.\nConsumers\
    \ can scan the QR code and check the amount\nof pesticides in it (via a centralized\
    \ database) online before\nbuying.\nAir pollution is an important concern today\
    \ because it is\nchanging the climate of the earth and degrading air quality.\n\
    Vehicles cause a lot of air pollution. An IoT application\nproposed by Manna et\
    \ al. [39] monitors air pollution on the\nroads. It also tracks vehicles that\
    \ cause an undue amount of\npollution. Electrochemical toxic gas sensors can also\
    \ be used\nto measure air pollution. Vehicles are identified by RFID tags.\nRFID\
    \ readers are placed on both sides of the road along with\nthe gas sensors. With\
    \ this approach it is possible to identify\nand take action against polluting\
    \ vehicles.\n9.6. Supply Chain and Logistics. IoT tries to simplify real\nworld\
    \ processes in business and information systems [101].\nThe goods in the supply\
    \ chain can be tracked easily from\nthe place of manufacture to the final places\
    \ of distribution\nusing sensor technologies such as RFID and NFC. Real\ntime\
    \ information is recorded and analyzed for tracking.\nInformation about the quality\
    \ and usability of the product can\nalso be saved in RFID tags attached with the\
    \ shipments.\nBo and Guangwen [102] explain an information transmis-\nsion system\
    \ for supply chain management, which is based\non the Internet of Things. RFID\
    \ tags uniquely identify a\nproduct automatically and a product information network\n\
    is created to transmit this information in real time along\nwith location information.\
    \ This system helps in automatic\ncollection and analysis of all the information\
    \ related to supply\nchain management, which may help examine past demand\nand\
    \ come up with a forecast of future demand. Supply chain\ncomponents can get access\
    \ to real time data and all of this\ninformation can be analyzed to get useful\
    \ insights. This will\nin the long run improve the performance of supply chain\n\
    systems.\n9.7. Energy Conservation. The smart grid is information and\ncommunication\
    \ technology enabled modern electricity gen-\neration, transmission, distribution,\
    \ and consumption system\n[103].\nTo make electric power generation, transmission,\
    \ and\ndistribution smart, the concept of smart grids adds intel-\nligence at\
    \ each step and also allows the two-way flow of\npower (back from the consumer\
    \ to the supplier). This can\nsave a lot of energy and help consumers better understand\n\
    the flow of power and dynamic pricing. In a smart grid,\npower generation is distributed.\
    \ There are sensors deployed\nthroughout the system to monitor everything. It\
    \ is actually a\ndistributed network of microgrids [104]. Microgrids generate\n\
    power to meet demands of local sites and transmit back\nthe surplus energy to\
    \ the central grid. Microgrids can also\ndemand energy from the central grid in\
    \ case of a shortfall.\nTwo-way flow of power also benefits consumers, who are\n\
    also using their own generated energy occasionally (say, solar,\nor wind power);\
    \ the surplus power can be transmitted back so\nthat it is not wasted. The user\
    \ will also get paid for that power.\nSome of the IoT applications in a smart\
    \ grid are online\nmonitoring of transmission lines for disaster prevention and\n\
    efficient use of power in smart homes by having a smart meter\nfor monitoring\
    \ energy consumption [105].\nSmart meters read and analyze consumption patterns\
    \ of\npower at regular and peak load times. This information is\nthen sent to\
    \ the server and also made available to the user. The\ngeneration is then set\
    \ according to the consumption patterns.\nIn addition, the user can adjust her/his\
    \ use so as to reduce\ncosts. Smart power appliances can leverage this information\n\
    and operate when the prices are low.\n10. Design Considerations in an IoT System\n\
    Now, that we have profiled most of the IoT technologies, let\nus look at some\
    \ of the design considerations for designing a\npractical IoT network.\nThe first\
    \ consideration is the design of the sensors. Even\nthough there might not be\
    \ much of a choice regarding\nthe sensors, there is definitely a lot of choice\
    \ regarding\nthe processing and networking capabilities that are bundled\nalong\
    \ with the sensors. Our choices range from small sub-\nmW boards meant for sensor\
    \ motes to Arduino or Atom\nboards that consume 300–500 mW of power. This choice\n\
    depends on the degree of analytics and data preprocessing\nthat we want to perform\
    \ at the sensor itself. Secondly, there\nis an issue of logistics also. To create\
    \ a sub-mW board, we\nneed board design expertise, and this might not be readily\n\
    available. Hence, it might be advisable to bundle a sensor with\ncommercially\
    \ available embedded processor kits.\nThe next important consideration is communication.\
    \ In\nIoT nodes, power is the most dominant issue. The power\nrequired to transmit\
    \ and receive messages is a major fraction\nof the overall power, and as a result\
    \ a choice of the networking\ntechnology is vital. The important factors that\
    \ we need\nto consider are the distance between the sender and the\nreceiver,\
    \ the nature of obstacles, signal distortion, ambient\nnoise, and governmental\
    \ regulations. Based on these key\nfactors, we need to choose a given wireless\
    \ networking\nprotocol. For example, if we just need to communicate\ninside a\
    \ small building, we can use Zigbee, whereas if we\nneed communication in a smart\
    \ city, we should choose\nSigfox or LoraWAN. In addition, often there are significant\n\
    constraints on the frequency and the power that can be spent\nin transmission.\
    \ These limitations are mainly imposed by\ngovernment agencies. An apt decision\
    \ needs to be made by\ntaking all of these factors into account.\nLet us then\
    \ come to the middleware. The first choice that\nneeds to be made is to choose\
    \ between an open source mid-\ndleware such as FiWare or a proprietary solution.\
    \ There are\npros and cons of both. It is true that open source middleware\nis\
    \ in theory more flexible; however, they may have limited\nsupport for IoT devices.\
    \ We ideally want a middleware\nsolution to interoperate with all kinds of communication\n\
    protocols and devices; however, that might not be the case.\nHence, if we need\
    \ strict compatibility with certain devices and\nprotocols, a proprietary solution\
    \ is better. Nevertheless, open\nsource offerings have cost advantages and are\
    \ sometimes\neasier to deploy. We also need to choose the communication\n22\n\
    Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering\nprotocol and ensure that it is\
    \ compatible with the firewalls\nin the organizations involved. In general choosing\
    \ a protocol\nbased on HTTP is the best from this point of view. We also\nneed\
    \ to choose between TCP and UDP. UDP is always better\nfrom the point of view\
    \ of power consumption. Along with\nthese considerations, we also need to look\
    \ at options to store\nsensor data streams, querying languages, and support for\n\
    generating dynamic alerts.\nFinally, let us consider the application layer. Most\
    \ IoT\nframeworks provide significant amount of support for cre-\nating the application\
    \ layer. This includes data mining, data\nprocessing, and visualization APIs.\
    \ Creating mashups and\ndashboards of data is nowadays very easy to do given the\n\
    extensive support provided by IoT frameworks. Nevertheless,\nhere the tradeoff\
    \ is between the features provided and the\nresources that are required. We do\
    \ not need a very heavy\nframework if we do not desire a lot of features. This\
    \ call needs\nto be taken by the application developers.\n11. Conclusion\nIn this\
    \ survey paper we presented a survey of the current\ntechnologies used in the\
    \ IoT domain as of 2016. Currently,\nthis field is in a very nascent stage. The\
    \ technologies in\nthe core infrastructure layers are showing signs of maturity.\n\
    However, a lot more needs to happen in the areas of IoT\napplications and communication\
    \ technologies. These fields\nwill definitely mature and impact human life in\
    \ inconceivable\nways over the next decade.\nCompeting Interests\nThe authors\

  analysis: There is a widespread usage of smart sensors and actuators in the IoT
    based agriculture which collects data related to the soil, water requirements,
    nutrients and weather conditions. ML algorithms are utilized for data analysis
    to automate farming practices and to make them more controlled and optimized.
    ML classification algorithms and DL techniques such as CNN and RNN have been used
    for identifying and classifying diseases and weeds in crops. Smart irrigation
    systems are used for efficient use of water resources and to provide right amount
    of water at the right place and time. These systems employ regression algorithms
    and neural networks for accurate estimation of irrigation requirements. Robots
    and drones equipped with digital cameras are used for livestock monitoring and
    management along with smart IoT devices and ML, DL, and hybrid algorithms. NLP
    based chatbots can be built for farmers and more ML, DL, and hybrid algorithms
    can be explored in the agriculture industry for sustainable use of available resources
    as a scope of future work.

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality

    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture

    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.

    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are crucial in supporting continuous environmental
    monitoring, where

    sensor nodes are deployed and must remain operational to collect and transfer
    data from the environment to a

    base-station. However, sensor nodes have limited energy in their primary power
    storage unit, and this energy

    may be quickly drained if the sensor node remains operational over long periods
    of time. Therefore, the idea of

    harvesting ambient energy from the immediate surroundings of the deployed sensors,
    to recharge the batter-

    ies and to directly power the sensor nodes, has recently been proposed. The deployment
    of energy harvesting

    in environmental field systems eliminates the dependency of sensor nodes on battery
    power, drastically re-

    ducing the maintenance costs required to replace batteries. In this article, we
    review the state-of-the-art in

    energy-harvesting WSNs for environmental monitoring applications, including Animal
    Tracking, Air Quality

    Monitoring, Water Quality Monitoring, and Disaster Monitoring to improve the ecosystem
    and human life.

    In addition to presenting the technologies for harvesting energy from ambient
    sources and the protocols that

    can take advantage of the harvested energy, we present challenges that must be
    addressed to further advance

    energy-harvesting-based WSNs, along with some future work directions to address
    these challenges.

    INTRODUCTION

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of spatially distributed, autonomous,
    wireless, net-

    worked sensing devices that can be used to monitor a physical space (Yick et al.
    2008; Sharma

    et al. 2016). WSNs have gained increasing popularity for a range of applications,
    such as environ-

    mental monitoring (Khedo et al. 2010; Bhattacharya et al. 2012; Postolache et
    al. 2014; Adamo et al.

    2015), animal tracking (Szewczyk et al. 2004; Pereira et al. 2008; Amundson and
    Koutsoukos 2009;

    and floods (Estrin et al.

    2002; Akyildiz et al. 2002; Devasena and Sowmya 2015), and health monitoring of
    civil structures

    such as bridges and buildings (Lee et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2007; Hu et al. 2013).

    Of particular interest in this article are WSNs used for environmental monitoring,
    including

    water quality monitoring, air quality monitoring, plant/animal tracking, and disaster
    monitoring.

    These environmental monitoring WSNs, also called “field systems,” oftentimes consist
    of a number

    of sensor nodes distributed in the environment along with a local gateway node
    that gathers the

    data for storage or to transmit the data to a remote server. In these systems,
    the sensor nodes are

    low-cost, battery-operated devices with the ability to sense the specific environmental
    parameters

    required by the application and transfer the collected data to the local gateway
    for processing and

    storage. Hence, a sensor node consists of the sensor(s), a wireless transceiver,
    a micro-controller,

    memory, and a battery to power the node.

    When running on batteries, the limited lifetime of the sensor nodes is one of
    the main chal-

    lenges in implementing WSNs for environmental monitoring applications (Potnuru
    and Ganti

    2003; Muthukarpagam et al. 2010). In many of these applications, it is difficult
    to change the bat-

    teries of the nodes regularly, and hence once a sensor node depletes its battery,
    that node can be

    considered dead.

    Over the years, researchers have focused on designing energy saving techniques
    to minimize the

    energy consumption of the sensor nodes at the physical (PHY), medium access (MAC),
    and routing

    layers (Muthukarpagam et al. 2010; Khajuria and Gupta 2015). However, even with
    very energy

    efficient sensing and communication protocols, once the limited battery energy
    is exhausted, the

    sensor node can no longer participate in the network operations (Khajuria and
    Gupta 2015).

    To address the challenge of the limited energy supply to sensor nodes powered
    by batteries, new

    WSN platforms that support the harvesting of energy from the immediate surroundings
    have been

    developed. These devices are able to capture small amounts of energy that would
    have been lost as

    heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement within the environment (Shaikh and
    Zeadally 2016a). By

    recharging the battery with energy harvested from the environment, and by developing
    energy-

    harvesting aware protocols that support so-called “energy-neutral operation,”
    theoretically, WSNs

    could have infinite lifetime. Several researchers have explored technologies to
    harvest energy from

    natural sources, such as the sun, wind, and water flow, to power the sensor nodes
    (Shaikh and

    Zeadally 2016a), while others have explored man-made sources of energy, such as
    human walking,

    magnetic fields, high-frequency vibrations, and RF fields (Chandrakasan et al.
    1999).

    Starting from the early 2000’s several researchers have conducted surveys in the
    area of WSNs

    and Energy-Harvesting WSNs (EH-WSNs), pointing out the various energy sources,
    storage tech-

    nologies, communication network operations, and specific implementation areas
    where sensor

    networks are applicable and deployable (Paradiso and Starner 2005; Gilbert and
    Balouchi 2008;

    Wan et al. 2011; Sudevalayam and Kulkarni 2011; Ku et al. 2016). Other surveys
    conducted in this

    area looked into the energy-harvesting sensor node architecture and relative challenges
    and limita-

    tions of powering the sensor node through energy harvesting (García-Hernández
    et al. 2007; Seah

    et al. 2009; Tan and Panda 2010a). Of particular interest is the work presented
    in Sudevalayam and

    Kulkarni (2011), which describes the design implications of powering WSNs via
    energy harvesting.

    Here, the authors present a survey on energy-harvesting sources, mechanisms, and
    architectures,

    discussing the two main sensor node architectures (i.e., harvest-use and harvest-store-use),
    tech-

    niques for converting different energy sources to electrical energy, and different
    types of energy

    storage technologies. In addition, the authors provide some examples of real implementations
    of

    EH-WSNs.

    In this article, we present the state-of-the-art on EH-WSNs. Starting with a description
    of the

    available energy sources (such as radiant, mechanical, and thermal) and the technologies
    used

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:3

    for harvesting energy, we provide an overview of some EH-WSNs that deploy hybrid
    energy-

    harvesting systems. We then describe the common wireless sensor node architecture
    and present

    the benefits and drawbacks of using different types of energy storage (such as
    rechargeable bat-

    teries and super-capacitors). In addition, we discuss different energy prediction
    algorithms and

    energy management techniques to cope with the unpredictability of energy-harvesting
    rates from

    the environment, and we discuss their impact on the design of energy-harvesting-aware
    com-

    munication protocols. This article extends the work done by Sudevalayam and Kulkarni
    (2011),

    presenting recent developments and techniques in communication protocol design
    in WSN appli-

    cations with energy-harvesting capabilities. We present new techniques that do
    not just consider

    energy-based metrics (such as the effective energy, cumulative energy usage, energy
    value), link

    quality, and duty cycling for route selection, but we also consider previous knowledge
    of the net-

    work and energy count to determine the route based on the energy harvesting of
    the nodes in

    a path and the status of future path hops and not only the next hop to select
    routes. Finally, we

    present different implementations that use EH-WSNs for environmental monitoring,
    and discuss

    the current challenges and future research directions.

    The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the motivation
    for EH-WSNs.

    In Section 3, we describe the different sources of energy that can be harvested
    by sensor devices.

    Section 4 presents the sensor node power system architecture, and the energy storage
    technologies,

    energy prediction, and energy management techniques used in EH-WSNs. In Section
    5, we discuss

    the various approaches at the Physical, MAC, and Routing layers developed for
    EH-WSNs, as well

    as some tools that have been proposed for simulating and emulating EH-WSNs. In
    Section 6, we

    discuss the performance/design requirements in EH-WSNs compared to traditional
    WSNs, and we

    give an overview of performance analytical models that guarantee QoS under worst-case
    scenarios.

    In Section 7, we discuss some implementations of EH-WSNs in Animal Tracking (AT),
    Air Quality

    Monitoring (AQM), Water Quality Monitoring (WQM), and Disaster Monitoring (DM).
    In Section 8,

    we present the challenges related to EH-WSNs and provide future research directions
    in developing

    energy-harvesting-based wireless sensor networks. Finally, Section 9 concludes
    the article.

    MOTIVATION

    The existence of life on earth depends upon the availability of quality air and
    quality water for hu-

    mans, animals, and plants. For instance, ingesting contaminated drinking water
    containing harm-

    ful chemicals and waste products causes diseases (i.e., diarrhea), and even deaths
    of humans and

    animals (Owa 2014; Landrigan and Fuller 2016). Furthermore, according to the WHO,
    80% of deaths

    related to ischemic heart disease are caused by outdoor air pollution. The WHO
    has also reported

    that 14% of deaths in recent times were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    or acute

    lower respiratory infections due to air pollution, and 6% of deaths were due to
    lung cancer also

    related to outdoor air pollution (WHO 2014). Hence, monitoring air quality is
    essential to improve

    lives. Moreover, there is a high cost associated with providing fencing and mustering
    for animals.

    Therefore, providing situational awareness of the state of the pasture and of
    the animals can greatly

    improve livestock management (Wark et al. 2007).

    Due to patients’ needs for real-time, low-cost, and flexible health monitoring
    systems to keep

    track of their body parameters, sensor nodes can also be integrated into a wireless
    body area

    network (WBAN) to enable a proactive personal health management system that has
    the potential

    to transform the future of healthcare (Pantelopoulos and Bourbakis 2010; Omer
    and Al-Salihi 2017).

    Another critical area where WSNs can provide safety and save lives is in military
    applications

    and hostile areas where deploying soldiers can be risky or dangerous (Azzabi et
    al. 2017). WSNs

    can be an integral part of information distribution in various military scenarios
    such as blast local-

    ization, perimeter surveillance and protection, nuclear, chemical, and biological
    attacks detection,

    and missile monitoring, which can decrease fatality rate by providing more accurate
    and real-

    time data (Đurišić et al. 2012). Furthermore, WSNs can be used for disaster management
    applica-

    tions such as floods and earthquakes for detection, monitoring, and rescue operations
    (Saha and

    Matsumoto 2007; Aziz and Aziz 2011; Mahamuni 2016).

    Supply chain management is critical in various areas such as the food supply chain
    to reduce

    loss of perishable food by deploying sensor nodes for temperature monitoring,
    damage detection,

    and transportation tracking (Evers et al. 2007; Parreño-Marchante et al. 2014).
    Furthermore, hu-

    man errors can lead to a significant revenue loss, hence, automating the supply
    chain process

    using WSNs can enhance quality of service, improve efficiency, and increase revenue
    (Wang et al.

    2015). Similarly, inventory management using WSNs can prevent manual process errors
    and en-

    sure personnel safety by limiting the need to be in dangerous environments such
    as offshore oil

    rigs (Vellingiri et al. 2013).

    Governments, policy makers, engineers, and scientists around the world are looking
    for ways

    to curb these environmental problems. WSNs can be used to monitor the environment
    to provide

    information that can aid in finding solutions to these issues. While WSNs provide
    distributed

    sensor readings that can be valuable in mapping the environment, there are a number
    of

    challenges to their continuous operation. Specifically, as the sensor nodes are
    battery operated, to

    achieve consistent monitoring, sensor nodes must be designed to be as energy efficient
    as possible

    (Potnuru and Ganti 2003). Thus, energy management is key, requiring protocols
    that reduce energy

    dissipation in the physical, MAC and routing layers, as well as energy efficient
    topology control

    protocols that simultaneously support the application Quality of Service (QoS)
    (Kawahara et al.

    2009; Muthukarpagam et al. 2010; Swati and Priyanka 2010; Basagni et al. 2013;
    Gupta and Sikka

    2015).

    While all of the research on energy-efficient protocols has helped to prolong
    the lifetime of

    WSNs, for environmental monitoring applications, it is vital to ensure continuous
    operation with-

    out the need to change batteries. Achieving this goal requires the adoption of
    novel technologies,

    such as energy harvesting, which opportunistically acquires energy from solar,
    wind, mechan-

    ical vibrations, magnetic or RF fields to recharge the node batteries. Recent
    advances in these

    energy-harvesting technologies, and the commercialization of sensor nodes that
    support energy

    harvesting, have led to a new class of WSNs, referred to as Energy-Harvesting
    WSNs (EH-WSNs).

    The ability of EH-WSNs to power the sensor nodes through ambient energy sources
    has led to a

    shift in the design requirements and goals of these networks, as network lifetime
    is, ideally, no

    longer an issue. Instead, the goal in EH-WSNs is to support energy-neutral operation,
    so that the

    EH-WSN can operate continuously using the harvested energy.

    Energy harvesting provides new opportunities as well as challenges for the design
    of the pro-

    tocols and algorithms to support environmental monitoring. In particular, rather
    than focusing

    narrowly on reducing the node energy consumption to extend network lifetime, as
    is the key de-

    sign metric in traditional WSNs, in EH-WSNs it is important to re-consider the
    impact of perfor-

    mance metrics such as energy-efficiency, fairness, scalability, and latency in
    the presence of energy

    flow into the network. Similarly, physical, MAC and routing protocols need to
    be re-designed to

    optimize the rate at which the energy is used, rather than simply minimizing the
    total energy

    expenditure.

    Given the above, it is important to clearly define the performance metrics and
    design require-

    ments that impact EH-WSNs, given that energy is no longer limited in the same
    way. Hence, in

    this article, we survey the current state-of-the-art techniques for harvesting
    energy for WSNs as

    well as the latest protocols and algorithms that optimally utilize this harvested
    energy to support

    the application goals and provide continuous environmental monitoring.

    ENERGY-HARVESTING SOURCES

    Over the past few years, energy-harvesting technologies have greatly improved
    in terms of their

    efficiencies, and devices that can provide continuous power output from different
    energy sources

    such as solar energy and vibration have been developed (Instruments 2015a). Furthermore,
    recent

    WSN devices are designed to be extremely energy efficient, enabling them to operate
    using the

    limited harvested energy for a very long period of time without shutting down,
    at least not due

    to energy depletion. There are multiple sources of natural and man-made energy
    that can be har-

    vested by the sensor node and converted to electrical energy, and each power source
    provides a

    different power density, as shown in Table 1.

    In the following subsections, we describe the different types of energy that can
    be harvested

    from radiant sources (e.g., solar energy and radio frequency waves), mechanical
    sources (e.g., vi-

    brations, wind, human body motion, and water flow), and thermal sources (e.g.,
    temperature dif-

    ference between two conducting materials, external heat, and friction sources),
    and we provide

    some examples of commercial harvesters (Seah et al. 2009; Tan and Panda 2010b).

    3.1

    Radiant Energy

    Radiant energy is harvested from the sun and from radio frequency waves, for both
    indoor and

    outdoor systems. In recent years, energy harvesting from radio frequency and sunlight
    has been

    explored extensively in an attempt to utilize this source of energy to power wireless
    sensor net-

    works for environmental monitoring applications (Morais et al. 2008; Bhuvaneswari
    et al. 2009;

    Tabbakh et al. 2010; Alippi et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2014).

    3.1.1

    RF Energy. In RF energy harvesting, rectifying antennas (or rectennas) are used
    to cap-

    ture electromagnetic signals emitted from nearby sources like mobile phones or
    radio stations,

    which are then converted to regulated DC power using a rectifier circuit to be
    utilized by small,

    low power consumption systems such as sensor devices (Ramesh and Rajan 2014).
    Some RF

    sources like radio stations transmit high amounts of RF power (up to megawatts),
    but due to path

    loss and fading, their signals reach the harvesting antennas at relatively low
    levels (Lim et al.

    2013), thus making the harvesting process challenging. Nevertheless, RF energy
    harvesters are

    promising when implemented in urban and suburban areas due to the large amount
    of ambi-

    ent energy sources and the relatively small distance between the RF sources and
    the receiving

    antenna (Pinuela et al. 2013). Implementing a multi-band antenna array architecture
    enhances

    the efficiency of RF energy harvesters and allows energy harvesting even for low-power
    signals

    (as low as −29dBm) (Pinuela et al. 2013). Efficient RF energy harvesting requires
    spectrum analysis

    and knowledge of the harvester distance and direction from the RF source, as the
    receiving antenna

    requires an appropriate level of beam-pointing and polarization matching to ensure
    that the max-

    imum amount of power is harvested. A survey on wireless networks using RF energy
    harvesting

    was provided in Lu et al. (2015), where the authors discussed the state-of-the-art
    in RF circuit de-

    sign and implementations as well as describing resource allocation design issues
    in RF-EHWSNs,

    and presenting future research directions and practical challenges that still
    need to be addressed.

    3.1.2

    Solar Energy. There are two main approaches for converting sunlight into usable
    energy:

    (1) thermal conversion, whereby the energy from the sun is converted into electricity
    by heating

    a medium that passes through a turbine generator, and (2) photovoltaic conversion,
    whereby light

    is directly converted into electricity and therefore does not require any moving
    parts or interme-

    diate energy conversion steps (Bube 2012). Solar energy harvesting based on photovoltaic
    tech-

    nology provides the highest power density of around 15mW/cm2 on bright sunny days
    (Morais

    et al. 2008; Bhuvaneswari et al. 2009), as indicated in Table 1. This makes solar
    an appropriate

    energy-harvesting technique suitable for environmental monitoring EH-WSNs.

    Photovoltaic harvesters have several advantages when employed for EH-WSNs. Since
    its incep-

    tion, solar energy harvesting has remained one of the most reliable, convenient,
    and preferable

    energy-harvesting sources available in WSNs (Li and Shi 2015). Photovoltaic harvesters
    produce

    constant and direct current (DC) to power sensor nodes. Hence, they do not require
    additional

    circuit rectification (i.e., converting from alternating current (AC) to DC).
    Solar energy-harvesting

    approaches are non-emissive, harmless to the environment, and their current and
    voltage levels

    meet the power requirements of wireless sensor nodes (Akbari 2014; Zhou et al.
    2014; Shaikh

    and Zeadally 2016b). Although solar energy is a preferred source for powering
    sensor nodes

    in unattended areas, the amount of energy that can be harvested is seasonal and
    depends on

    the area where the solar panels are deployed. For example, in environmental applications,
    sen-

    sor nodes might be deployed under shaded areas that do not receive much sunlight
    even during

    the day and receive no sunlight during the night. This affects the operational
    cycle of the sensor

    nodes.

    Indeed, there are several environmental monitoring implementations that harvest
    solar energy.

    For example, in Figure 1(a) a solar panel is embedded on the front of the enclosure
    containing

    a sensor node to harvest energy for water quality monitoring applications. Another
    way to at-

    tach solar panels to the sensor node is to mount the solar panel on the sensor
    node, as shown in

    Figure 1(b), which is especially useful for air quality monitoring applications.
    An overview of the

    various commercially available solar cells is presented in Table 2.

    There are two design principles proposed for solar energy-harvesting modules due
    to the lim-

    ited amount of power generated from these systems: (1) the system should be designed
    to extract

    the maximum amount of power at any given point in time, and (2) power management
    subsystem

    efficiency should be maximized to effectively utilize the limited amount of energy
    harvested for

    use by the sensor nodes. These principles are difficult to adhere to when designing
    practical appli-

    cations, because a solar cell active area (i.e., the area of the solar cell through
    which the light enters

    the solar cell) varies when used for power generation (Morais et al. 2008). Other
    limiting design

    factors include the energy storage unit capacity and power conditioning subsystem
    features. The

    latter can lead to a lower solar to electrical energy conversion efficiency if
    it is not operated at the

    solar cell maximum power point (i.e., the highest possible power output of a solar
    cell) (Morais

    et al. 2008).

    A key design consideration with respect to solar energy harvesters, is Maximum
    Power Point

    Tracking (MPPT) (Rodriguez and Amaratunga 2007; Simjee and Chou 2008; Dondi et
    al. 2008;

    To maximize

    the amount of power harvested from solar cells and to overcome the design challenges
    imposed

    by MPP in the design of wireless nodes, new design schemes are proposed to ensure

    incident light

    conditions change and to ensure that the PV module always operates at its MPP.

    K. S. Adu-Manu et al.

    In selecting the appropriate solar energy harvester for environmental applications,
    the factors

    that need to be considered are the solar-harvesting circuitry, the battery technology,
    data trans-

    mission adaptation mechanisms, and the ability for the node to perform MPPT. Also
    in designing

    the recharging circuit, features of much concern are power consumption, cost,
    and its ability to

    provide unlimited power supply to the sensor node and also to recharge the batteries
    efficiently

    (Bhuvaneswari et al. 2009; Shaikh and Zeadally 2016a). Some of these design considerations
    are

    provided in the work done by Sudevalayam and Kulkarni (2011), in which a detailed
    discussion

    was provided on solar energy-harvesting systems, their energy storage technologies
    and whether

    they apply MPPT or not. Another similar work that looked into solar energy-harvesting
    systems

    is the work of Bader et al. (2014). In their work, the authors presented an evaluation
    of some of

    the recent solar energy-harvesting architectures and common methods for their
    modeling. Each of

    these systems were classified based on the input regulation method (i.e., a distinction
    between sys-

    tems with voltage level compliance and those that perform MPPT), the output regulation
    method

    (i.e., systems that implemented DC-DC boost regulator), and the storage technology
    implemented

    in the systems.

    DuraCap and OpenWise (Chen and Chou 2010; González et al. 2012) are two of the
    recent solar

    energy-harvesting systems. DuraCap (Chen and Chou 2010) is composed of a solar
    panel, energy

    storage, system control unit, power regulator, and MPPT circuitry. DuraCap stores
    harvested en-

    ergy in three super-capacitors—the booting super-capacitor (responsible for cold
    booting), and two

    reservoir super-capacitors (responsible to provide power for the target device).
    DuraCap provides

    two different output voltages: 3.3V and 4.2V. The 3.3V is supplied for use by
    the system and 4.2V

    (similar to Li- ion battery) is directly used by the target devices. DuraCap addresses
    the problem

    with the traditional DC-DC converter by utilizing a pulse-frequency modulated
    (PFM) regulator

    to transfer the harvested energy, which is similar to Everlast. Unlike all the
    other solar energy-

    harvesting nodes, all functions in DuraCap are performed by a low-power micro-computer
    unit

    (MCU), which uses its ADC to detect the voltage value of the solar panel, super-capacitors,
    and

    the current sensor output.

    In conclusion, it is important to note that the choice of solar energy-harvesting
    sensor node

    with battery only, super-capacitors, or both will allow developers to set up an
    efficient WSN for

    environmental monitoring applications that are deployed in harsh areas where it
    is difficult to

    change the batteries. Therefore, knowing and considering the important features
    of these tech-

    nologies are very relevant in recent times. Design considerations include sensor
    nodes robustness

    (in terms of storage, charge and discharge rate), low price, MPPT performance,
    and data trans-

    mission mechanism to achieve a longer lifetime of the WSN. For example, since
    super-capacitors

    are more efficient than batteries and offer higher lifetime in terms of charge-discharge
    cycles, sys-

    tems that include a layered energy storage mechanism (i.e., by using both super-capacitors
    and

    a battery) are good for such environmental applications. Similarly, those that
    employ multiple

    super-capacitors like DuraCap will equally be useful in such applications (Bhuvaneswari
    et al.

    2009).

    3.2

    Mechanical Energy

    Another source of energy that can be harvested to power WSNs is mechanical oscillations
    or

    vibrations. Typically, mechanical energy is harvested using piezoelectric devices
    (Seah et al. 2009).

    Due to the piezoelectric materials’ properties, piezoelectric energy-harvesting
    devices are

    known to generate energy at higher voltages without any external voltage supply.
    For instance,

    piezoelectric ceramic PZT is known for its high energy conversion rate, while
    polyvinylidene

    fluoride (PVDF) is known for its high mechanical strength (Zhou et al. 2014).
    Other advan-

    tages piezoelectric harvesters offer in WSNs include their easiness to model due
    to their simple

    structure, low cost, and absence of electromagnetic interference (Wang 2012b;
    Zhou et al. 2014;

    Shaikh and Zeadally 2016b). On the other hand, piezoelectric devices require energy-harvesting

    circuits to regulate the output power leading to energy losses, thereby affecting
    the overall ef-

    ficiency of the energy-harvesting system (Zhou et al. 2014). Moreover, it is difficult
    to integrate

    piezoelectric devices into a small system (Wang 2012b; Shaikh and Zeadally 2016b).

    There are a number of systems that have been developed using piezoelectric devices.
    For ex-

    ample, in Kahrobaee and Vuran (2013), an underground piezoelectric energy harvester
    used in

    an agricultural application was shown to provide encouraging capabilities in harvesting
    above

    ground accelerations from a four wheeler center pivot irrigation system.

    Energy harvesting from the vibrations of roads caused by automobiles is another
    promising

    technique for powering wireless sensor nodes. This approach has been used for
    monitoring car

    exhaust fumes (air quality measurements) or measuring traffic flow (disaster traffic
    management)

    (Vijayaraghavan and Rajamani 2008, 2010; Zhu et al. 2012). Additionally, harvesting
    energy from

    vibrations has been used for disaster relief operations (Hande et al. 2010), where
    experimental

    results show that a mechanical vibration energy-harvesting system can provide
    sustainable en-

    ergy for operation. A high vibrational acceleration, wide range frequency band,
    and an adaptive

    resonant frequency tracker are the main requirements to design a high performance
    vibration

    energy-harvesting system.

    Wijesundara et al. (2016) proposed a WSN-based system to monitor the location
    of Asian ele-

    phants that harvests the kinetic energy generated by the elephants’ movements
    to power the sen-

    sors. The proposed harvester is composed of one moving magnet, two stationary
    magnets, a poly-

    carbonate tube, and two coils. Through experimentally validated analytical and
    simulation models

    of the energy harvester, and measurements of the elephant movement, the proposed
    prototype was

    found to be able to generate 88.91 J per day. This energy was able to power a
    mounted tracking

    unit (tag), which transmits the elephant’s location to a remote monitoring center
    at least 24 times

    a day.

    Energy can also be harvested from water current depending on the water flow rate,
    either from

    water flow with greater pressure (turbulent) or flow at a constant velocity. The
    energy derived from

    flowing water is mainly kinetic. Kinetic energy is obtained as a result of pressure
    fluctuations or

    by applying pressure to the flowing water using mechanical devices and must be
    converted into

    electrical energy. While water flow energy harvesting has not been explored extensively
    in WSNs,

    some research has explored how to harvest energy from flowing water. Most of these
    works used

    different techniques to harvest kinetic energy. For example, Pobering and Schwesinger
    (2004) used

    a fluttering flag to harvest kinetic energy from a turbulent flowing water to
    electrical energy using

    a piezoceramic transducer; Wang and Liu (2011) used a shear mode piezoelectric
    energy harvester

    to harness energy from pressurized water flow; Ye and Soga (2011) harvested energy
    using a micro-

    turbine from a water distribution system in different bypass pipes; and Sun and
    Hu (2011) used an

    electromagnetic vibration generator to harvest energy from the periodic movement
    of a magnet

    within a coil box.

    Although the works described above harvest energy from water to power small devices
    such

    as sensor nodes, they come with limitations such as complexity and large size
    (Sun and Hu

    2011), and high power generation due to the pressure differences between the water
    and the

    ambient air (Ye and Soga 2011) causing the system to waste energy when used to
    power sen-

    sor nodes that require only 15mW out of the total 150W generated by the system.
    Hence, these

    systems remain impractical to adapt and integrate in smaller devices such as wireless
    sensor nodes,

    which are usually used for Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) and other environmental
    monitoring

    systems.

    3.3

    Thermal Energy

    Thermal energy harvesting is based on the fact that when there is a temperature
    difference between

    two conducting materials, an electric current is generated (Seah et al. 2009).
    Many environmental

    studies on thermal powered sensor nodes have been conducted throughout the years.
    For example,

    in Woias et al. (2014), a thermoelectric generator (TEG) was mounted to a sheep’s
    collar for track-

    ing purposes. The thermal energy harvester depends on the temperature gradient
    between the

    sheep body and the ambient environment. This system was shown to be capable of
    generating a

    maximum power of 54μW, which is capable of powering a low-power Very High Frequency
    (VHF)

    radio tracking system. Similarly, a thermal powered sensor node model is developed
    in Davidson

    et al. (2009). The proposed system benefits from the temperature difference between
    the ocean

    water surface that is heated by the sun and the immediate ambient air to monitor
    water quality.

    The average output power was shown to be about 5mW/cm2 all year long.

    Deploying thermal energy harvesters in WSNs depends on the efficiency of the thermoelectric

    materials (Zhou et al. 2014). To increase the thermal energy harvester output
    voltage and power

    levels, multiple arrangements of thermocouples are required, because the individual
    thermocou-

    ple’s voltages and power levels are very low. Therefore, thermal energy harvesters
    are more suit-

    able for large scale power generation such as steam turbines (Gilbert and Balouchi
    2008; Shaikh

    and Zeadally 2016b).

    3.4

    Hybrid Energy-Harvesting Systems

    A few researchers have proposed hybrid energy-harvesting systems that combine
    multiple types

    of energy harvesters into a single system. In this section, we review some of
    these existing hybrid

    energy-harvesting systems.

    3.4.1

    Solar/Thermal Systems. A solar/thermal hybrid system was proposed in Li et al.
    (2008) and

    Yu et al. (2008) for self-sustained wireless sensor nodes. The system consists
    of a solar panel and a

    TEG as energy converters, a Li-ion battery in addition to a super-capacitor for
    energy storage, and

    a power management subsystem. The proposed system was experimentally tested and
    shown to

    provide continuous support of the node operation for more than 5 years under normal
    conditions,

    while it was able to operate for only 7 continuous days in darkness or rain. A
    hybrid indoors artifi-

    cial lightning and thermal energy harvesting was proposed in Tan and Panda (2011).
    The hardware

    prototype demonstrates a solar cell, a miniature TEG, and a combined power management
    circuit,

    and it was shown to harvest an average electrical power of 621μW. A hybrid solar/thermal
    har-

    vesting system for indoor ammonia gas concentration measurements in an organic
    fertilizer plant

    was proposed in Chottirapong et al. (2015). The TEG utilizes the heat difference
    between the hot

    side and the cold side of a deodorizer tank. The system was able to generate a
    minimum of 15mW

    all day and a maximum of 290mW in the morning.

    3.4.2

    Solar/Thermal/Electromagnetic Systems. Virili et al. (2014) designed and fabricated
    a hy-

    brid electromagnetic/thermal harvesting system. The system is composed of a quarter-wavelength

    patch antenna that operates in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) frequency
    band 2.4–

    2.48GHz and that supports a thermoelectric generator (TEG) on top of it. In addition
    to electro-

    magnetic energy harvesting from the antenna, when the sun’s rays hits the TEG,
    its top side heats

    up while it cold side is at ambient temperature. This temperature difference allows
    extra thermal

    energy harvesting. The TEG was able to generate 20 and 50mV for air waves at 50
    and 100◦C,

    respectively (Virili et al. 2015). Moreover, the authors enhanced their hybrid
    system by integrat-

    ing a solar cell on top of the TEG in Virili et al. (2016). When the sun rays
    hits the solar cell, it

    converts solar energy into electric energy, and concurrently the generated heat
    is transfered to

    Open Source & Commercial Harvesters

    In Table 4, we present the technical specifications of some energy harvesters
    that are either open

    source or commercially-developed. From this table, we can see that solar energy
    harvesters are on

    the lower end of the price range, while thermal harvesters are on the upper end.
    Increasing the

    solar cell size increases the output power of the cell, but the efficiency of
    solar cells is still not more

    than 20% (see Table 2). RF energy harvesters are the smallest in terms of size,
    which is reflected

    in their output power. The main consideration when selecting the type of energy
    harvester is to

    choose the right type based on the ambient energy source available in the deployment
    site.

    ENERGY-HARVESTING NODE ARCHITECTURE

    Sensor nodes have evolved from large devices into current day small, embedded
    devices consisting

    of one or multiple sensing units, a radio transceiver, a processing unit, and
    a power unit (see

    Figure 2). Around 2010, sensor nodes with energy harvesters were introduced, which
    has led to

    the development of EH-WSNs. In these networks, the sensor node architecture is
    composed of one

    or multiple sensing units, a radio transceiver, a processing unit, an energy harvester,
    one or more

    energy storage units, a power management system, and possibly an energy predictor
    (Kochlan

    et al. 2015; Basagni et al. 2013), as shown in Figure 2.

    The energy-harvesting system converts harvested energy into electrical energy
    for use by the

    sensor node, either directly (as shown in Figure 3(a)) or indirectly by first
    recharging the node

    energy storage (as shown in Figure 3(b)). In the latter, the energy storage is
    a basic part of the sensor

    node power unit that stores harvested energy and supplies the node with the required
    energy to

    operate. Furthermore, energy predictors are used to estimate the amount of harvested
    energy that

    will be available at any given time to a sensor node. Power management techniques
    have been a

    Energy Storage

    Traditionally, sensor nodes have been powered by batteries, typically alkaline,
    Nickel-Metal hy-

    dride (Ni-MH), Lithium-ion (Li-Ion), or Lithium iron disulfide (Li-FeS2) batteries.
    The alkaline bat-

    teries are cheap but have lower capacity and short lifetimes compared to Li-FeS2
    batteries (Reddy

    2010). The introduction of rechargeable Li-Ion batteries in the early 2000s improved

    capacity and the network lifetime, as the specific energy increased to about 150Wh/kg
    instead of

    about 60Wh/kg cycles for Ni-MH batteries (Reddy 2010).

    The main technologies used to store harvested energy for powering sensor nodes
    in EH-WSNs

    are super-capacitors and rechargeable batteries. In this section, we provide an
    overview of these

    different technologies.

    4.1.1

    Super-capacitors. Super-capacitors are based on the same operational principles
    as regu-

    lar capacitors, however they have narrower dielectrics and a larger surface area,
    which results in

    a capacitance increase leading to higher energy and power densities than regular
    capacitors and

    batteries, respectively. In addition, super-capacitors are charged quicker and
    they have cycle life-

    times that are typically longer than conventional capacitors. On the other hand,
    super-capacitors

    discharge at a higher rate than regular batteries due to leakage, which fortunately
    can be com-

    pensated by the higher charging rate (Halper and Ellenbogen 2006). Table 5 shows
    a comparison

    among super-capacitors that were tested experimentally (Weddell et al. 2011; Kovář
    2013). Accu-

    rate modeling of super-capacitors is important in the design of EH-WSNs, hence
    much research

    has been done in modeling their behavior under different assumptions, ranging
    from modeling

    the super-capacitor as an ideal device (Jiang et al. 2005) to more accurate models
    that take into ac-

    count the super-capacitor internal charge distribution process using a three-branch
    circuit model

    (Weddell et al. 2011; Nadeau et al. 2014).

    4.1.2

    Rechargeable Batteries. Rechargeable batteries are used for energy storage due
    to their

    high energy densities (Halper and Ellenbogen 2006). Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH),
    Lithium Ion

    (Li-Ion), and Lithium Ion Polymer (LiPo, a Li-Ion rechargeable battery in a pouch
    format) are the

    most common types of batteries. A comparison of these different batteries is provided
    in Table 6.

    Table 7 provides a high level comparison between super-capacitors and rechargeable
    batteries.

    Additionally, a Ragone plot showing the current super-capacitor and rechargeable
    battery

    technologies is shown in Figure 4. For systems with limited node size or in case
    of financial

    limitations, rechargeable batteries are preferable over super-capacitors due to
    their lower price

    and higher energy density. On the other hand, for applications that require a
    long lifespan or

    operates in low temperatures, a combination of super-capacitors and rechargeable
    batteries would

    be optimal, as the super-capacitors have a much longer lifetime and a large range
    of operating

    temperatures (Sánchez et al. 2011; Ongaro et al. 2012). We note that, in recent
    times, energy

    storage in WSNs is often a combination of rechargeable batteries and super-capacitors
    to benefit

    from both the higher number of charge/discharge cycles of super-capacitors and
    the high energy

    density of rechargeable batteries (Kochlan et al. 2015).

    4.2

    Energy Prediction

    Energy prediction is important for EH-WSNs, because protocols can be optimized
    if there is some

    knowledge of not only the existing (stored) energy but also the energy that will
    be harvested

    in both the short and long term. However, as the amount and rate of energy that
    can be har-

    vested from different energy sources are generally dynamic and highly variable,
    accurate energy

    prediction can be quite challenging. Different energy sources can be categorized
    based on their

    predictability and controllability (Shaikh and Zeadally 2016a). For example, for
    solar energy, an

    Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) algorithm assumes the energy generation
    at a

    certain time is an exponentially weighted moving average of the energy harvested
    at the same

    time on previous days (Kansal et al. 2007). This model is applicable to stable
    weather conditions

    but does not account for frequent meteorological changes, which results in an
    average error of

    28% between the predicted and the actual harvested energy. Weather-Conditioned
    Moving Aver-

    age (WCMA) algorithm divides the day into time slots, and at the end of each time
    slot the energy

    prediction of the next time slot is provided. The WCMA algorithm includes data
    from the same

    time in past days and scales it with respect to the difference in weather conditions
    between the

    current day and the past days to achieve a better prediction model, with an average
    error of 9.8%

    (Piorno et al. 2009). In Moser et al. (2007), the energy predictor collects information
    about the re-

    ceived energy at the current time and combines it with an exponentially decaying
    old data from

    past days. A comparison between these algorithms shows that the WCMA algorithm
    provides the

    best energy prediction with the lowest error; however, it requires more storage
    memory and longer

    prediction time (Bergonzini et al. 2009).

    Sharma et al. (2010a) designed their algorithm to benefit from local weather forecasting
    data

    by creating a model that translates weather forecast data into an energy-harvesting
    prediction.

    Although weather forecasting can provide more accurate data than algorithms that
    take only the

    past days into account, this algorithm requires high overhead to transmit the
    weather prediction

    data to the sensor nodes. In Noh and Kang (2011), an algorithm based on EWMA is
    proposed. To

    overcome EWMA’s inability to account for varying weather conditions, a scaling
    factor (which is

    the ratio between the predicted and the actual energy harvested) is calculated
    at the end of each

    time slot and used to adjust the predicted energy for the future time slot.

    In Cammarano et al. (2012), the proposed Profile energy prediction model (Pro-Energy)

    algorithm collects a day-long profile that contains information about the energy
    harvested at each

    time slot throughout the day, and then classifies the day into a typical profile:
    sunny, cloudy, or

    rainy. At each time slot, Pro-Energy predicts the harvested energy based on the
    day profile most

    similar to the current day. Pro-Energy is composed of three components, the prediction
    module,

    which is responsible for short and long term energy prediction, the profile analyzer,
    which selects

    the most similar profile to the current day, and the profile pool, which contains
    a collection of dif-

    ferent energy profiles. Pro-Energy achieves a 60% improvement in prediction accuracy
    compared

    to EWMA and WCMA. Furthermore, the authors proposed an enhanced version of this
    protocol

    called Profile Energy prediction model with Variable-Length Time slots (Pro-Energy-VLT)
    in

    Cammarano et al. (2013). Instead of the common design of dividing a day into fixed-length
    time

    slots, Pro-Energy-VLT assigns a variable length time slot based on the average
    daily harvesting

    rate computed using historical data. The newly proposed protocol outperformed
    Pro-Energy,

    WCMA, and EWMA, achieving a lower prediction error up to 10%, 40%, and 50%, respectively.

    Moreover, Pro-Energy-VLT achieves a higher performance in terms of energy and
    memory

    saving. In addition, increasing the number of time slots results in a lower prediction
    error, as this

    allows a better estimation of the fluctuating energy source. These results were
    obtained using

    real-life experiments using Telos B nodes interfaced with solar panels and wind
    micro-turbines

    (Cammarano et al. 2016).

    In general, solar prediction models provide a reasonable indication of the energy
    to be harvested

    from solar energy. However, solar energy is the most predictable energy source
    when compared

    to the other sources described in Section 3, and accurate prediction models for
    the other energy

    sources are still needed.

    4.3

    Power Management

    As described above, the amount of energy harvested is variable, e.g., for solar
    energy harvesting,

    no energy will be harvested at night. This variability in the available energy
    for EH-WSNs has

    led to the idea of designing either the individual node or the larger network
    to operate at an

    energy equilibrium, also called energy-neutral operation (ENO) (Sharma et al.
    2010b). Energy-

    neutral operation refers to a state where the energy consumed by a node is always
    less than or

    equal to the energy harvested from the operating environment (Kansal et al. 2007;
    Sharma et al.

    2010a; Fafoutis and Dragoni 2011; Baghaee et al. 2014). Designing an EH-WSN to
    support energy-

    neutral operation theoretically leads to infinite network lifetime (Kansal et
    al. 2007; Fafoutis and

    Dragoni 2011).

    Given its importance, various approaches have been proposed to achieve ENO and
    can be classi-

    fied into predictive approaches that predict the energy and adjust the node operations
    accordingly

    to satisfy ENO, or reactive approaches that monitor the node energy generation
    level and adjust

    some aspect of the node operation in response to the harvested energy (Buchli
    et al. 2014). Existing

    energy-neutral systems are designed to use analytical models and protocols to
    schedule tasks in

    accordance with the amount of energy harvested from the environment (for both
    predictive and

    reactive approaches) (Kansal and Srivastava 2005; Vigorito et al. 2007).

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    communication and the harvesting-aware utility-based sensing rate allocation algorithm
    (Gu et al.

    2009; Fafoutis and Dragoni 2011; Sharma et al. 2010b; Zhang et al. 2011; Shu et
    al. 2017) enable task

    (e.g., communication or sensing tasks) scheduling to meet ENO. Furthermore, techniques
    such as

    duty cycling and adaptive sensing (Alippi et al. 2009; Hsu et al. 2006), adaptive
    control (Vigorito

    et al. 2007), topology control (Tan et al. 2015; Yoon et al. 2015; Wang et al.
    2016b), cooperative

    transmission (Zhang et al. 2016a), frame length optimization (Li et al. 2017),
    adaptive throughput,

    and mean delay optimal energy-neutral policies have been proposed for EH-WSNs
    to maximize

    the performance of the network given the rate of energy that is harvested by the
    sensor nodes

    (Sharma et al. 2010b; Fafoutis and Dragoni 2011).

    Adaptive duty cycling or control are mechanisms that allow the energy-harvesting
    sensor nodes

    to autonomously adjust their duty cycle (that is, waking up the sensors) according
    to the energy

    availability in the operating environment. In this case, the nodes are assumed
    to have prior knowl-

    edge of the energy profile (Hsu et al. 2006).

    Since energy storage devices have a limited capacity and are prone to energy leakage,
    it is not

    always beneficial to maximize conserved energy, especially when excessive energy
    could be har-

    vested (Gu et al. 2009). Gu et al. (2014) rely on this fact to propose an energy
    synchronization com-

    munication (ESC) protocol that aims to minimize the communication delay in EH-WSNs
    through

    dynamically synchronizing the nodes’ activity patterns or working schedule with
    the available

    energy budget and simultaneously achieving energy-neutral operation.

    Topology control is another method to manage the energy consumption of the WSN
    by properly

    adapting the node transmission power and number of neighbors (Santi 2005). In
    Tan et al. (2015),

    the behavior of sensor nodes are defined as an ordinal potential game in which
    a Nash equilibrium

    is proven to exist. In this game theory approach, the energy status and harvesting
    capabilities

    of the sensor nodes are considered, and consequently the high and low harvesting
    power nodes

    cooperate together to optimize the network topology and achieve network connectivity.
    In Yoon

    et al. (2015), a hierarchial topology control approach is implemented in which
    the sensor nodes

    are arranged in layers based on their residual energy levels. Since nodes closer
    to the sink require

    more energy to aggregate data, this approach shifts the network load into high
    residual energy

    levels. In Wang et al. (2016b), a localized topology control approach selects
    the node’s neighbors

    based on their distance and their remaining energy levels, which is modeled as
    a Bernoulli random

    process to take into account the energy-harvesting capabilities of the sensor
    nodes.

    In Dynamic Power Management (DPM), which is another technique for power management,
    the

    main focus is on reducing the power consumption while maintaining the network
    performance at

    a reasonable level by switching the nodes to different energy states. In DPM,
    to save power, the

    nodes go into the sleep mode whenever they are not needed, and they are woken
    up when they

    are required to process the data or send or receive the packets. In this way the
    node lifetime is

    increased by reducing its power consumption. It is important to note that an efficient
    sleep mode

    transition algorithm is essential. In Sinha and Chandrakasan (2001), several sleep
    states are defined

    for each node based on which components are put in the sleep mode. In the deeper
    sleep states,

    more components of the node are in sleep mode, and thus less power is consumed.
    However, this

    translates into an higher latency for waking up the node. In Chen et al. (2013),
    the authors present

    a multi-hop wake-up radio-based sensor node that improves the wake-up range while
    achieving

    low power consumption for energy-harvesting sensor nodes. Their implementation
    consists of a

    low-power wake-up radio circuit combined with a WISP-Mote, which allows both an
    ID-based and

    a broadcast-based wake-up mechanism.

    To reduce the energy used for sensing operations, adaptive sensing can be employed
    to

    dynamically regulate the amount of data sensed in a given period of time (Alippi
    et al. 2009;

    Sharma et al. 2010b; Zhang et al. 2013, 2016b; Yoon et al. 2016). Cooperative

    proposed in Zou et al. (2016) to balance the network energy consumption by optimizing
    the nodes’

    sleeping schedules. Cooperative transmission and relay selection is a widely used
    concept in

    sensor networks to provide better energy efficiency (Cui et al. 2004). Zhang et
    al. (2016a) proposed

    a cooperative transmission scheme that aims at balancing the node’s residual energy
    levels. Based

    on the initial energy in the source, channel gain and source’s energy-harvesting
    rate, the node

    that achieves the maximum sensors’ residual energy is chosen as a relay to cooperate
    with the

    source node. This protocol is shown to provide better residual energy balancing
    compared to

    the largest Er (LERS) scheme, where the relay with the highest initial energy
    is chosen, and the

    minimum energy consumption scheme (MECS) in which the node that minimizes the
    total energy

    consumption is chosen as the relay node (Berbakov et al. 2013).

    There are three main design considerations discussed in Kansal et al. (2007) for
    energy neutral-

    ity in WSNs. These include the size of the energy buffer, the operational performance
    level when

    in energy-neutral mode, and the measurement capabilities required in the hardware
    for harvesting

    the energy. Typically, the energy buffer could be a a battery or a super-capacitor
    used to store the

    harvested energy depending on the energy generation profile. In an energy-harvesting
    system, it

    would be ideal to have an energy buffer that could store any amount of energy
    without any inef-

    ficiency in the charging process and one that does not leak energy over a period
    of time when the

    sensor node is in use. In practice, it becomes difficult to harvest energy without
    these inefficiencies

    and leakages. Hence, the implementation of energy neutrality in such systems is
    paramount. The

    performance level will be determined based on the power-management strategies
    employed.

    Measuring the amount of energy harvested from the environment and the variability
    in the en-

    ergy supply can be helpful when employing power management schemes to manage the
    amount

    of energy used for sensing, communication, and data processing in energy-harvesting
    sensor net-

    work systems. In Baghaee et al. (2014), the combination of vibrational energy
    harvesting, recharge-

    able batteries and adjusting the sensor node duty cycle has been shown to empirically
    achieve en-

    ergy neutrality. In addition, an energy-neutral clustering protocol is proposed
    in Peng et al. (2015)

    to maintain the network operation and achieve energy neutrality. The uncertain
    nature of the

    amount of harvested energy results in a more challenging protocol design, as this
    requires more

    sophisticated prediction models. When designing an EH-WSN, a design goal is to
    maximize the

    network performance while meeting ENO. Achieving this goal depends on the energy
    harvested

    by multiple distributed nodes rather than simply at individual nodes, as the network
    load should

    be allocated based on the energy harvested by the entire network (Kansal et al.
    2007).

    Although the energy harvested from the environment can be quite variable in nature,
    a long

    term data collection and analysis for the amount of energy harvested may lead
    to a high perfor-

    mance protocol design that will operate and achieve energy-neutral operation over
    the long run

    rather than for a short period of time. In contrast to providing nodes with energy
    using static charg-

    ers through wireless energy transfer, energy harvesting using mobile chargers
    have received much

    attention due to their ability to provide stable energy supply to the nodes, which
    has lead to a new

    type of WSN called Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) (Baroudi and
    Al-Roubaiey

    2014; Fu et al. 2016). Although WRSNs can potentially decrease the uncertainty
    of harvested en-

    ergy, there are different challenging areas that still need to be explored such
    as localization, syn-

    chronization and velocity control of mobile chargers (Fu et al. 2013; Shu et al.
    2015, 2016).

    COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS FOR EH-WSNS

    In WSNs, communication protocols are used to efficiently collect sensor data from
    distributed sen-

    sors and deliver this data to a local base station. The main purpose of these
    protocols is to effectively

    utilize the energy supplied to the node for sensing, computation, and communication/networking.

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:19

    In traditional WSNs, as the energy is limited by the batteries, energy efficient
    protocol design is a

    key component for designing systems that achieve long lifetimes.

    Over the years, there have been a number of protocols developed to try to minimize
    the energy

    required to send data throughout the network, at the physical, link (MAC), and
    network layers,

    as well as protocols for topology control and network connectivity to ensure sufficient
    data are

    collected and the network remains connected (Lynch and Loh 2006; Nack 2010; Potnuru
    and Ganti

    2003). In these traditional WSNs, the important performance metrics are application
    quality of

    service (QoS) and energy-efficiency (network lifetime). Hence, protocols such
    as routing protocols

    seek to achieve the required QoS while at the same time reducing energy dissipation
    as much

    as possible. To achieve this, energy is often considered as the metric to optimize,
    for example, in

    selecting next hop neighbors in routing (Singh et al. 2010; Nack 2010).

    On the other hand, EH-WSNs obtain energy from the harvester to continuously power
    the sen-

    sor nodes. Hence, rather than making decisions to minimize energy drain, in EH-WSNs
    the ulti-

    mate goal is to design protocols that effectively manage the use of this variable
    energy to support

    application QoS goals. For example, in EH-WSNs, energy may not be considered as
    a routing met-

    ric, because the design will no longer focus on energy efficiency of the sensor
    nodes and the overall

    network, but instead it will focus on the active time a node can operate with
    the minimum amount

    of energy harvested in a specified time interval. Additionally, physical layer
    issues related to the

    modulation scheme and power transmission are of much interest in EH-WSNs. Different
    commu-

    nication protocol parameters that must be adapted for EH-WSNs are presented in
    Sudevalayam

    and Kulkarni (2011).

    Meeting these new goals for EH-WSNs requires different types of optimizations
    of existing pro-

    tocols as well as new designs that consider the variable energy supply of the
    node. In the following

    sections, we overview the various protocol changes needed to support EH-WSNs at
    the physical,

    MAC, and routing layers.

    5.1

    Physical Layer

    Data transmission and reception are the most energy-consuming operations in wireless
    sensor

    nodes (Carmona et al. 2014) and, to maintain a certain bit error rate, the transmission
    power must

    increase as the distance between the communicating nodes increases (Nanavati and
    Deshpande

    2015). Furthermore, higher transmission power can increase the interference with
    other nodes.

    As a result, the transmission power must be adjusted appropriately to find an
    optimum operating

    point that can result in a high packet delivery ratio or achieve energy-neutral
    operation (Yildiz

    et al. 2016). Sudevalayam and Kulkarni (2011) provided a discussion on how to
    adjust the node’s

    transmission power based on its current and predicted effective energy in addition
    to the node’s

    energy consumption to achieve ENO. In Fan and Liu (2016), an energy synchronized
    transmission

    control scheme (ESTC) is proposed, in which each node adjusts its transmission
    power based on

    its energy budget and traffic load.

    In this article, we describe the latest advances in power adjustment protocols
    and present two

    additional techniques developed to enhance the system performance by changing
    the number of

    transmitting and/or receiving antennas and the usage of adaptive source and channel
    coding in

    addition to adaptive modulation schemes.

    5.1.1

    Power Adjustment Based on Link Quality Parameters. In the literature, many algorithms

    are available to adjust the transmit power based on link quality parameters such
    as received

    signal strength and link quality indicator (Yildiz et al. 2016; Carmona et al.
    2014). For example,

    Abo-Zahhad et al. (2015) provided the optimal transmission power that minimizes
    the energy per

    bit for different modulation schemes as a function of the distance. Lin et al.
    (2006) proposed a pro-

    tocol for WSNs in which the nodes’ transmission power is controlled based on the
    link quality of

    the neighbors. In this adaptive transmission power control algorithm, each node
    receives feedback

    packets carrying the link quality information. Based on the collected link quality
    information,

    each node determines a suitable transmission power to reach a particular neighbor
    and, when the

    quality of the transmission link changes, the node adjusts its transmit power
    accordingly.

    In Aprem et al. (2013), the authors proposed a protocol that adapts the transmission
    power based

    on the current Channel State Information (CSI). In automatic repeat request (ARQ)-based
    packet

    transmissions, the sender node may receive either an ACK packet indicating a successful
    trans-

    mission or a NACK packet indicating an unsuccessful one. In Aprem et al. (2013),
    each ACK/NACK

    packet includes the CSI, which is then used by the transmitter to adjust the transmit
    power for

    the next data packet. For instance, if the channel is in good condition, the sender
    may reduce the

    transmit power for the next transmission to save energy. Conversely, if the CSI
    shows a low link

    quality, a higher transmission power is chosen for the transmission of the next
    packet.

    Building off of this work, an optimal power allocation algorithm for EH-WSNs is
    presented

    in Sinha and Chaporkar (2012). Assuming that the transmitter has the full CSI,
    the transmission

    power that maximizes the link throughput is calculated by formulating the power
    allocation prob-

    lem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). They consider different states for the
    channel and the

    battery, and their model decides the optimal transmit power for that specific
    state so that the max-

    imal overall throughput can be achieved. Every state represents the energy in
    the battery and also

    the channel fade coefficient. The actions that can be taken at each state is based
    on the amount

    of transmit power that is allocated to the node. Moreover, they assumed that the
    battery has a

    limited capacity and can be recharged through a renewable source like the wind
    or solar. Their

    aim is to find the optimal transmit power such that the reward function, which
    is defined based

    on the channel’s capacity, is maximized.

    5.1.2

    Multi Antenna-Based Protocols. Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) radio antenna tech-

    nology is another approach to adjust the transmission power to improve energy
    efficiency in wire-

    less networks. In such networks, various dynamic antenna selection schemes can
    be used for com-

    munication: Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO), Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO),
    Single-Input

    Multi-Output (SIMO), and Single-Input Single-Output (SISO). Each of these schemes
    has different

    power consumption, and different protocols that adapt both the number of antennas
    and the trans-

    mit power for the data communication have been proposed in the literature. In
    Ayatollahi et al.

    (2015), the authors employed an adaptive multi-antenna protocol in which the number
    of anten-

    nas for sending and receiving the data and thus the transmit power is adjusted
    according to the

    channel bit-error-rate, the transmission distance, and the available energy in
    the nodes’ buffers.

    Among four dynamic antenna selection schemes, the one that provides the highest
    lifetime for the

    system is chosen on a per-packet basis.

    In Zhang and Ho (2013), a novel multi-antenna broadcast channel (MIMO-BC) system
    for si-

    multaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) energy in a three-node
    network

    is proposed, and the authors show fundamental trade-offs in designing future SWIPT
    systems. In

    their system, all three nodes (one transmitter and two receivers) are equipped
    with multiple anten-

    nas, of which, one of the receiver nodes is responsible for harvesting the energy
    and transferring

    it to the other nodes, while the second receiver decodes the data sent by the
    transmitter. At the

    receiver-side, the authors proposed two receiver designs. In the first design,
    the receivers switch

    between harvesting and transferring the energy and receiving the data packets.
    In the second de-

    sign, the received signal is split into two separate signals with different power
    levels, with each

    signal being sent to one of the receivers.

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:21

    5.1.3

    Joint Source-Channel Coding Based Protocols. In EH-WSNs, since the amount of har-

    vested energy is variable and unpredictable, sensor nodes should employ adaptive
    source coding,

    adaptive channel coding and modulation scheme selection (Bai and Nossek 2013;
    Motlagh et al.

    2015; Castiglione and Matz 2014; Yao et al. 2012). However, modulation scheme
    selection and

    adaptive source-channel coding in which source encoders and channel encoders are
    jointly

    designed, can be very challenging without robust energy prediction models that
    estimate the

    amount of available energy in the future (Zhai et al. 2005; Castiglione et al.
    2011). Due to the

    prediction-based nature of energy-harvesting problems, some of the algorithms
    assume that

    either the full knowledge of the harvested energy in the future is known at the
    transmitter, or

    both the history and the future harvested energy are available prior to the communication.

    The problem of minimizing the mean squared error of estimated source symbols at
    the receiver

    side in an energy-harvesting estimation system is explored in Zhao et al. (2013).
    Here, the authors

    consider two cases, when the transmitter only knows the amount of harvested energy
    in the past

    and also when the transmitter knows the harvested energy in the past, present,
    and the future.

    The throughput of energy-harvesting transmitters is analyzed by employing discrete
    M-ary

    Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) and coding rates in Bai and Nossek (2013).
    Bai and

    Nossek (2013) assumed that the energy arrival in a specific time duration is fully
    known at the

    transmitter to maximize the total throughput. According to their simulation results,
    the through-

    put of the system with the coded transmission is better than the uncoded one when
    the distance

    between the transmitter and the receiver is more than 50 meters. In Yao et al.
    (2012) the source

    packet generation rate is optimized by choosing the number of packets that allow
    the system to

    achieve ENO. Here, the authors proposed a source coding rate algorithm that first
    transmits the

    most valuable data packets.

    In Castiglione et al. (2012), an energy management model is proposed that focused
    on allocating

    the energy to the channel encoders and source encoders based on different parameters
    such as

    available energy, quality of the wireless channel, and the state of the data queue.
    This protocol

    simultaneously achieves maximal average distortion and ensures the stability of
    the queue that

    connects the source and the channel encoders. For networks with more than two
    nodes, they

    employed TDMA-based scheduling policies to ensure the stability of the data queues
    at the nodes.

    In Motlagh et al. (2015), an adaptive source-channel coding system with an energy-harvesting

    transmitter is proposed in which the channel codewords change according to the
    variation of

    available battery energy, their main goal being to minimize the distortion at
    the receiver side. They

    found a lower bound for the average distortion in a system with a constant transmission
    power and

    infinite battery capacity. A similar problem for the case of a finite and rechargeable
    battery in the

    energy-harvesting nodes is discussed in Castiglione and Matz (2014). Here, the
    authors proposed

    a joint energy management scheme for channel and source encoders, and proved that
    using this

    algorithm, a near-optimal level of distortion can be achieved with respect to
    the battery size.

    5.2

    MAC Layer

    Optimizing communication protocols is a cornerstone in the design of EH-WSNs,
    hence the im-

    portance of an efficient MAC layer design (Shahzad and Sheltami 2015). MAC layer
    synchronous

    protocols that rely on sharing nodes’ sleeping schedules are unsuitable for EH-WSNs,
    since the

    nodes’ charging periods (in which the node is considered to be unavailable for
    communication)

    may coincide with the wake up periods (Huang et al. 2013). Asynchronous schemes
    can be

    categorized into transmitter initiated schemes, in which the receiver wakes up
    periodically and

    checks for a preamble from the transmitter, and receiver initiated schemes where
    the receiver

    sends periodic beacons implying that it is ready to receive data (Bachir et al.
    2010). Existing MAC

    protocols for EH-WSNs fall primarily into three categories: adaptive duty-cycle-based
    protocols,

    CSMA type protocols, and polling-based protocols. The main idea behind the first
    two categories

    of protocols were discussed in the Sudevalayam and Kulkarni (2011) survey; nevertheless,
    we

    provide the latest advances in these protocols categories and, in addition, we
    discuss polling-based

    techniques, which were not included in the aforementioned survey.

    5.2.1

    Adaptive Duty Cycle Based Protocols. Several EH-WSN MAC protocols that use an
    adap-

    tive duty cycle have been developed; however, the protocols differ in the criteria
    that controls the

    node duty cycle. In the Energy Adaptive MAC (EA-MAC) protocol, the RF harvested
    energy adapts

    the node duty cycle (Kim and Lee 2011a). This protocol was developed for a star
    network in which

    the sink node is always awake to transmit RF energy to power the source nodes
    and receive data

    from them. When the node energy reaches a threshold, it awakens and competes for
    the channel

    to send its data based on the unslotted CSMA/CA algorithm in the IEEE 802.15.4
    protocol and then

    goes back to sleep. The authors extended their work to provide analytical model
    of the algorithm

    in Kim and Lee (2011b). Karthi et al. (2015) proposed an energy-harvesting WSNs
    MAC protocol

    based on the IEEE 802.15.4. IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode that uses a super-frame
    structure

    that consists of fixed active and non-active periods. In the active periods, the
    nodes access the

    channel according to the CSMA/CA protocol. Conversely, in the proposed protocol,
    if the node’s

    remaining energy is less than a certain threshold, the protocol reduces the node’s
    duty cycle to

    its minimum value. Otherwise, the proposed protocol adjusts the active and non-active
    periods

    according to the battery discharge characteristics, the node’s harvested and consumed
    energy.

    On Demand MAC (OD-MAC) is a receiver initiated protocol that uses a solar energy
    predic-

    tion model (i.e., the EWMA protocol described in Section 4.2) to set the node’s
    initial duty cycle

    (Fafoutis and Dragoni 2011). Then at each slot, the node checks its actual harvested
    energy, and

    based on the difference between this value and the predicted energy, it reduces
    or increases its

    duty cycle to achieve energy-neutral operation. Load and Energy Balancing MAC
    (LEB-MAC) (Liu

    et al. 2014) is an asynchronous, receiver initiated protocol that sets the duty
    cycle of the nodes in

    a distributed manner. Based on the node harvesting energy rate, the node sets
    its duty cycle and

    sends this information along with the next time it is expecting to wake up to
    its neighbors. When

    the neighbor nodes receive this information, they combine it with their own energy-harvesting

    rate to synchronizes the duty cycles (Liu et al. 2014).

    ERI-MAC is a receiver initiated duty cycle with carrier sensing MAC protocol developed
    for EH-

    WSNs (Nguyen et al. 2014). ERI-MAC depends on a receiver-initiated mechanism,
    which has been

    proven to be energy efficient in WSNs and widely used in adaptive duty cycling
    protocols. The

    protocol also applies a packet concatenation mechanism by aggregating similar
    small packets into

    a larger packet. This provides energy efficiency by reducing the control packets
    overhead. In their

    previous work, Byun et al. (2013) assigned low-priority packets a fixed queuing
    time-out before

    sending them. They have extended their work in ERI-MAC by dynamically changing
    the time-

    out according the energy-harvesting rate and the node’s energy consumption. When
    the energy

    consumption is higher than the energy harvested, the node switches to a sleeping
    mode until its

    batteries are recharged above a certain threshold.

    Two MAC protocols that adapt the node duty cycle based on the the current and
    expected energy

    are presented in Yoo et al. (2012). The authors first proposed the Duty-cycle
    Scheduling based

    on Residual energy (DSR) protocol, in which the node adjusts its duty cycle based
    only on its

    residual energy. Afterwards, the Duty-cycle Scheduling based on Prospective increase
    in residual

    energy (DSP) protocol was developed that takes into account the effect of future
    harvesting rates

    on the residual energy. A similar approach was proposed in Varghese and Rao (2014),
    in which

    the authors developed two protocols, the Exponential Decision MAC based on Current
    Residual

    protocol energy (ED-CR), and the Exponential Decision based on Prospective Increase
    in Residual

    energy (ED-PIR) protocol. The main difference between these approaches is that
    Yoo et al. (2012)

    proposed a linear decision graph to adapt the duty cycle while an exponential
    decision graph is

    implemented in Varghese and Rao (2014). ED-PIR achieves a better performance in
    terms of energy

    consumption, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio compared to DSP and to
    the non energy-

    harvesting receiver initiated protocol (RI-MAC) in which the receiver nodes wake
    up periodically

    to receive data.

    An adaptive duty cycle protocol developed for periodically powered indoors WSNs
    is proposed

    in Le et al. (2015). The protocol applies the Zero Energy Interval predictor (ZEI)
    proposed in

    Castagnetti et al. (2012) to determine the harvesting and non-harvesting periods.
    Then, it adjusts

    the node’s duty cycle according only to its residual energy in the non-harvesting
    periods. On the

    other hand, the protocol adapts the node’s duty cycle based on the harvested energy
    in addition

    to saving a portion of the collected energy to be utilized in non-harvesting periods.
    Similarly,

    Oueis et al. (2016) proposed an adaptive duty cycle MAC protocol for indoors and
    outdoors photo-

    voltaic EH-WSNs that takes into consideration the battery’s residual energy and
    its variation. The

    protocol compares the node’s remaining energy in two consecutive time slots, and
    if there is an

    increase/decrease in this value, which corresponds to a charging/discharging state,
    the protocol

    increases/decreases the duty cycle.

    FarMAC is a multi-source protocol developed for WSNs rechargeable by RF wireless
    power

    transfer (WPT) (Shao et al. 2016). In addition to the charging sink nodes, the
    protocol catego-

    rizes nodes into Energetic Sensor Devices (ESDs), which is ready to transfer its
    data directly, and

    lethargic sensor devices (LSD) that need energy replenishment before being able
    to conduct data

    transmission; the LSD devices are provided with a higher channel access probability.
    In the first

    stage, ESDs switch to a sleeping mode while LSDs use a CSMA/CA protocol to contend
    for chan-

    nel access, and the winner node communicates with a specific sink node to compute
    its required

    charging time and then switch to a sleeping mode. Afterwards, the sink node sends
    a Data Query

    (DQ) packet to the ESDs that contend for the channel and the winner replies with
    a Data Request

    (DR), which in turn responds with a Data Request Clear (DRC) packet. Afterwards,
    wireless power

    transfer and data collection are executed concurrently.

    5.2.2

    CSMA/CA Based Protocols. The RF-MAC protocol was developed to work with sensor

    nodes that harvest energy from multiple RF transmitters (Naderi et al. 2014).
    When the node resid-

    ual energy reaches a minimum threshold, it sends an RF request with its ID to
    the transmitters to

    replenish its energy, and a shorter inter-frame spacing (DIFS) is assigned to
    this energy request to

    assure it is given a higher priority than data exchange. When the node is ready
    to send its data, it

    contends for the channel based on a slightly modified CSMA/CA protocol. In particular,
    RF-MAC

    provides nodes with a higher harvesting rate a higher priority to access the channel
    by assigning

    them shorter back-off times.

    Energy Level MAC (EL-MAC) is an energy aware MAC protocol that was developed for
    energy-

    harvesting secondary users in cognitive radio networks, nevertheless it could
    be applied in EH-

    WSNs. In this protocol, the node channel access probability is set to be inversely
    proportional to

    its residual energy by assigning a smaller contention window to low energy nodes.
    This process

    ensures that low energy nodes have high probability to access the channel and
    then go back to

    sleep mode to save energy otherwise lost in channel sensing. Furthermore, this
    process lowers the

    probability of collisions by decreasing the number of contending nodes (Kim et
    al. 2014).

    5.2.3

    Polling Based Protocols. Polling is a common MAC protocol used in many EH-WSNs
    im-

    plementations. The simplest polling approach proposed for EH-WSNs is ID polling,
    where the sink

    node polls each of the nodes based on their ID regardless of the number of active
    nodes in the net-

    K. S. Adu-Manu et al.

    work or the node’s harvested energy rate. This approach is simple but can result
    in polling inactive

    nodes, which leads to a low network throughput (Eu et al. 2011).

    To overcome this problem, a Probabilistic ID polling protocol that depends on
    the number of

    active nodes in the network to determine a contention probability was proposed
    in Eu et al. (2011).

    In this protocol, the active nodes receive a broadcasted periodic polling packet
    from the sink node

    and generate a random number between 0 and 1. If this number is higher than the
    contention

    probability, then the node will defer from sending and wait for the next polling
    packet. Otherwise,

    it will send its data, and in the case of collisions, the sink node lowers the
    contention probability.

    The authors also provided analytical models for slotted CSMA, unslotted CSMA,
    ID polling, and

    probabilistic polling MAC schemes. They have shown that probabilistic polling
    achieves higher

    performance in terms of network throughput, fairness and scalability.

    Probabilistic polling protocol was extended to achieve a multi-hop WSN in Fujii
    and Seah (2011),

    by enabling sensor nodes to poll other nodes beyond the sink’s range and dynamically
    update their

    tier number in a multi-tier manner. The sink node polls the nodes in its transmission
    range, and

    then each polled node either sends its data back to the sink or rebroadcasts the
    same probabilistic

    value to a higher tier nodes. When a node gets polled by a lower tier node, it
    sends its data and the

    data it received from higher tier nodes, and this process is repeated until the
    data reaches the sink

    through intermediate tiers. Unlike the previous protocols, the authors used commercial
    devices as

    testbed validation of their approach.

    In EH-WSNs different nodes may harvest different amounts of energy, hence assigning
    the same

    contention probability for all nodes regardless of their energy state can be considered
    unfair to

    nodes with low energy levels based on Jain’s fairness index. EH-MAC is a multi-hop,
    asynchro-

    nous, receiver initiated polling scheme that provides nodes with lower charging
    rates more trans-

    mission opportunities by integrating their harvested energy rate into their contention
    probability

    (Kunikawa et al. 2015). This approach succeeded in increasing the network fairness
    but slightly

    lowers network throughput compared to ID polling and probabilistic polling.

    5.3

    Routing Layer

    Sensor nodes’ energy is the main consideration in routing protocol design for
    WSNs and EH-WSNs,

    as out of energy nodes affect the routing decisions and cause a degradation in
    the network perfor-

    mance. In designing an energy aware routing protocol for WSNs, minimum hop count
    schemes

    might not be optimal as they may lead to energy depletion of nodes in the shortest
    path at a higher

    rate than other network nodes. Hence, traditional routing protocols have been
    modified to include

    energy aware parameters. For example, Distributed Energy-Harvesting Aware Routing
    Algorithm

    (DEHAR), is an energy-aware routing protocol that includes the concept of energy
    distance, which

    is a combination of the hop count between the source and destination and the energy
    consumed in

    this path, to find the optimum route instead of only using the hop count (Jakobsen
    et al. 2010). To

    select the shortest path in energy-harvesting applications, some protocols are
    designed to perform

    the route selection based on the residual energy of the sensor node, while some
    EH-WSN routing

    protocols implement an energy consumption prediction model. There is a paradigm
    shift from en-

    ergy aware routing protocols (EARPs) to energy-harvesting aware routing protocols
    (EHARPs),

    as in EH-WSNs, routing protocols should focus on achieving the required QoS when
    the ambient

    energy is not available or limited (Wu and Liu 2013). In the following, we discuss
    the advanced

    schemes for routing in EH-WSNs that include incorporating the energy-harvesting
    rate into the

    route cost, updating the traditional geographic routing that depends on the nodes’
    location, and

    clustering-based routing protocols improved for EH-WSNs.

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:25

    5.3.1

    Offline Routing Protocols. In offline routing protocols, nodes’ routing tables
    are con-

    structed based only on previous knowledge of the network. Kollias and Nikolaidis
    (2015) imple-

    mented a seasonally aware routing protocol that builds the nodes’ routing tables
    based on their

    solar energy-harvesting rates and the created paths from previous years. These
    types of protocols

    are fairly simple and do not waste energy in overhead for creating routes. For
    energy-harvesting

    sources that are periodic or at least predictable, this type of routing protocols
    could be beneficial.

    The drawback of this approach is that if a node dies, an offline routing protocol
    cannot recover.

    To enhance the performance of EH-WSNs, routing protocols must go online to mitigate
    the affect

    of energy unpredictability. Two types of online protocols are discussed in this
    article, multi-hop-

    based and clustering-based EH-WSNs routing protocols.

    5.3.2

    Route Cost Based Protocols. Multi-hop routing protocols are based on finding the
    route

    cost using a cost function that takes into account energy-harvesting parameters.
    For example,

    Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) is modified in Gong et al. (2014) to support
    energy

    harvesting by replacing the hop count field with an energy count field to find
    the route with the

    minimum cost based on the energy harvesting of the nodes in the path. Similarly,
    Pais et al. (2011)

    proposed a routing protocol with a routing cost function that includes the hop
    count between

    source and destination, the source residual energy and the source’s harvested
    energy in the last

    time slot as its parameters. This routing algorithm is improved in Cheng et al.
    (2015) by taking

    into account the status of future path hops and not only the next hop.

    Peng and Low (2013) proposed an energy-neutral routing (ENR) protocol based on
    directed

    diffusion. In ENR, each node admits or rejects packet relay requests based on
    its energy-harvesting

    status, which aims at fairly distributing the network traffic load to achieve
    ENO. Smart Energy-

    Harvesting Routing (SEHR) proposed a cost function that formulates the energy
    consumption

    based on the sent data type in addition to the node’s energy and the expected
    energy-harvesting

    rate (Bai et al. 2015). SEHR selects routes using three main strategies including
    real-time node

    power estimation, which is based on the amount of energy harvested and the energy
    drain rate,

    the node mobility and stability, and finally the protocol prioritizes routes based
    on the data types

    available for transmission.

    These protocols do not take into account the waste of harvested energy due to
    finite-energy

    storage capacities, which is considered in the energy-harvesting wastage-aware
    (EHWA) routing

    algorithm (Martinez et al. 2014b). EHWA selects the best route by computing the
    cost associated

    with current residual battery level of a node to obtain a resultant energy. The
    route with the maxi-

    mum total resultant network energy is selected to transmit packets from source
    to destination. The

    authors extended their work by jointly optimizing multiple routing requests instead
    of optimizing

    each route separately with the objective of maximizing the total remaining energy
    in the network

    (max-total) or maximizing the minimum residual energy (max-min) by formulating
    this as a linear

    programming (LP) optimization problem (Martinez et al. 2014a). To maximize the
    total remaining

    energy, the shortest path is chosen, while the longer paths can be used when maximizing
    the mini-

    mum remaining energy to avoid low-energy nodes. This protocol works under the
    assumption that

    the required routing request information is available on demand. The jointly optimized
    protocol

    shows higher residual energy levels compared to both the max-total and max-min
    approaches.

    5.3.3

    Geographic Routing Based Protocols. Energy-harvesting opportunistic routing (EHOR)

    is a protocol developed for linear EH-WSNs. For each sender, EHOR divides the
    possible set of

    forwarding neighbors into regions and gives transmission probabilities to each
    region based on

    its distance from the sink, with the nearest region to the sink assigned the highest
    probability

    (Eu et al. 2010). The number of regions depends on the average energy-harvesting
    rates and the

    number of possible forwarding nodes, and for each region, only one node is chosen
    to forward

    packets to the sink to decrease the probability of collision. Afterwards, the
    authors developed

    adaptive routing protocol (AOR), which is a routing protocol for a general two
    dimensional

    EH-WSNs (Eu and Tan 2012). Opportunistic Routing algorithm with Adaptive Harvesting-aware

    Duty Cycling (OR-AHaD) is a one dimensional EH-WSNs routing protocol (Beheshtiha
    et al.

    2012). Similar to EHOR, the nodes are organized in zones, and nodes residing in
    zones closer

    to the sink have greater transmission priority based on their residual energy.
    In contrast to

    EHOR, OR-AHaD implements coordination messages between nodes and takes into account
    the

    estimated energy-harvesting rate in the near future to adjust the nodes’ duty
    cycles, which results

    in a better performance in terms of goodput compared to EHOR.

    Beaconless geographic routing protocols have been developed to overcome the challenges
    of

    conventional geographic routing protocols by reducing the cost of transmitting
    beacons and the

    maintenance of keeping neighbor information (Heissenbüttel et al. 2004). Instead
    of sending con-

    trol messages, the Energy-Efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing with Energy
    Supply (EBGRES)

    protocol starts sending the data packets itself (Jumira et al. 2013). EBGRES divides
    the network

    into subregions based on their progress towards the destination node and uses
    a three way hand-

    shake (DATA/ACK/SELECT) and a discrete dynamic forwarding delay scheme is applied
    to select

    the next node. Moreover, the selected node will make forwarding decisions based
    on the energy

    harvesting and the node’s duty cycle.

    Stability-Aware Geographic Routing in Energy-Harvesting wireless sensor networks
    (SAGREH)

    is a geographically based routing protocol that selects routes based on the location
    information,

    the residual and solar harvested energy, and the link quality of neighboring nodes,
    to enhance the

    route selection reliability and increase the network lifetime (Hieu et al. 2016).
    The authors used

    Packet Reception Rate (PRR), which is defined as the ratio of the number of receivers
    within a

    certain distance from the transmitter to the average number of receivers within
    the same distance

    as a link quality indicator to select the most stable multi-hop path between the
    transmitter and

    receiver. The proposed protocol surpasses the EHWA routing algorithm (Martinez
    et al. 2014b) in

    terms of average hop count, packet delivery ratio, and average consumed energy.

    5.3.4

    Clustered Network Based Protocols. Clustering is a valuable technique to enhance
    the net-

    work efficiency and balance the energy consumption of all nodes, and it has been
    used in WSNs

    to improve the network performance for large scale networks. In EH-WSNs, different
    approaches

    must be implemented for clustering to benefit from the energy-harvesting properties
    of the sensor

    nodes. The differences between clustering algorithms in WSNs and EH-WSWNs include
    choosing

    the cluster-heads, selecting the cluster-head rotation frequency, and determining
    how the com-

    munication is achieved between the sensor nodes and their assigned cluster-head
    or between the

    cluster-heads themselves.

    The node harvesting rate and its energy status are used to modify the probability
    of electing the

    node as a cluster head in EH-WSN clustering protocols (Bozorgi et al. 2015; Meng
    et al. 2012). In

    addition to choosing the cluster-head based on the energy-harvesting rates of
    the nodes, select-

    ing the optimum cluster-head position enhances the network performance, since
    the cluster-head

    position affects the energy consumption of the nodes inside the cluster (Zhang
    et al. 2013). Fur-

    thermore, an energy-neutral clustering protocol is proposed in Peng et al. (2015)
    to maintain the

    network operation and achieve energy neutrality. This protocol is based on scheduling
    a group of

    sensor nodes within a cluster to be the cluster head (CH) for specific time slots
    to share the traffic

    load and reduce the CH re-selection overhead, which achieves a perpetual network
    operation.

    A genetic-based algorithm called Energy-harvesting genetic-based unequal clustering-optimal

    adaptive performance routing algorithm (EHGUC-OAPR), is proposed in Wu and Liu
    (2013).

    EHGUC-OAPR is composed of a set-up phase and a steady state phase. During the
    setup phase,

    sensor nodes send their location, remaining energy and harvesting energy rate
    to the base station,

    which implements a genetic algorithm to form unequal size clusters and choose
    cluster heads.

    Then, the OAPR algorithm is executed to establish a routing path between cluster
    heads. After the

    set-up phase, the base station broadcasts the information about the cluster heads
    and the routing

    paths to all sensor nodes. Discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO), which
    is another optimiza-

    tion algorithm, is implemented in Li and Liu (2015) to select cluster heads. This
    proposed algorithm

    uses the EWMA algorithm to predict the nodes’ energy-harvesting rates.

    5.4

    Cross-Layer Protocols

    Castagnetti et al. (2014) proposed a joint duty-cycle and transmission global
    power management

    protocol that optimizes the nodes’ wake up periods and transmission power based
    on the harvested

    energy and link quality. They have applied the closed-loop power manager proposed
    in Castagnetti

    et al. (2012) to compute the transmission wake-up periods. The protocols used
    a combination of the

    exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) energy prediction model and the last
    received

    signal strength indicator (RSSI) from the base station to adjust the node’s transmission
    power.

    Han et al. (2015) proposed a cross-layer multi-path protocol that is based on
    geographic routing.

    At the physical layer, instead of using the maximum power, the nodes collaborate
    to adjust their

    transmission power according to their residual energy as proposed in Abdu and
    Salamah (2011).

    The connected k-neighborhood (CKN) sleep scheduling algorithm is applied at the
    MAC layer

    to dynamically adapt the nodes’ duty cycles according to their residual energy
    levels to allow

    the nodes to recharge their storage. In each epoch, the node runs the CKN algorithm
    and collects

    information about the 2-hop neighbors’ locations, residual energy, energy harvested
    and consumed

    rates to schedule the state of the next epoch, whether to be in active or sleep
    mode. In the routing

    layer, a 2-hop multi-path protocol named Two-Phase geographic Greedy Forwarding
    (TPGFPlus)

    is proposed in which the next hop is determined based on its progress to the destination,
    the node’s

    harvesting rate, and the node’s residual energy levels.

    A MAC/Routing cross-layer protocol for wireless sensor nodes with RF energy-harvesting
    ca-

    pabilities is proposed in Sasikala and Kumar (2016). The sensor nodes toggle between
    transceiver

    mode or harvesting mode based on the energy-harvesting time and the node’s active
    time. After

    the path between a sender and the receiver node is established, the node checks
    for data availabil-

    ity. If the node’s residual energy is higher than a certain threshold, then it
    sends an RTS signal,

    at which point all of its neighbors will go to harvesting mode for a certain duration
    except the

    intended receiving node. If the residual energy at the receiver is higher than
    a certain threshold,

    then it will reply with a CTS, at which point all of the receiving node’s neighbors
    will switch to

    harvesting mode. On the other hand, if the node has data to send but it does not
    have enough en-

    ergy, it switches off to recharge and after few cycles, if its energy is still
    below a certain threshold

    it transmits an energy request packet.

    5.5

    Simulation and Emulation Tools

    As described in the previous sections, when using an energy-harvesting source,
    the objectives of

    the communication protocols are fundamentally different than those of using a
    traditional energy

    source: rather than focusing on minimizing the maximum energy and adapting the
    operations

    according to the residual energy, algorithms need to shift the optimization to
    the maximum rate

    at which the energy can be used (Kansal et al. 2007).

    As a result, the need for a simulation framework for evaluating the performance
    of energy aware

    wireless networks has been widely recognized. Different generic network simulators
    are compared

    in Merrett et al. (2009), showing that no existing simulators natively provided
    models for the en-

    ergy source and the energy harvester, nor for simulating the energy consumptions
    of the different

    ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, Vol. 14, No. 2, Article 10. Publication date:

    K. S. Adu-Manu et al.

    elements that compose the wireless node. To overcome these limitations, Merrett
    et al. (2009) pro-

    posed WSNsim, one of the first simulators to include a set of flexible and extensible
    hardware and

    environment models to enhance the design of energy-aware sensor nodes. However,
    WSNsim is

    not available to the research community. Subsequently, an extension to ns-3 to
    support energy

    aware networks has been proposed (Wu et al. 2011). The framework in Wu et al.
    (2011) is designed

    and implemented with the objective of adding support for different energy sources
    and device en-

    ergy consumption models into ns-3 simulations. A generic energy model for OMNeT++
    has been

    presented in Chen et al. (2009), which allows the accurate evaluation of the energy
    consumption

    and network lifetime of sensor networks, taking into account the energy consumption
    of both the

    radio transceiver and the CPU.

    While these solutions provide viable simulation environments for energy-aware
    wireless net-

    works, they do not include support for the simulation of EH-WSNs. As a result,
    the increasing

    interest in evaluating the performance of energy-harvesting wireless systems brought
    forth sev-

    eral contributions to fill this gap. In particular, GreenCastalia, an energy-harvesting
    framework for

    the Castalia simulator (Castalia 2016) that allows the simulation of networks
    of embedded devices

    with heterogeneous harvesting and energy source capabilities, has been presented
    in Benedetti

    et al. (2013). Minakov and Passerone (2013) presented PASES, a standalone, flexible,
    and extensible

    design space exploration framework that allows an accurate analysis of the performance
    and en-

    ergy consumption of WSNs, from the application to the hardware level. This framework
    requires

    detailed power models of the node architecture to provide statistics about the
    power consumption

    and to determine the optimal hardware configuration. A complete ns-3 modeling
    of a practical

    WSN architecture with energy-harvesting capabilities has been described in Sánchez
    et al. (2011).

    However, the focus of Sánchez et al. (2011) was to simulate the performance of
    the particular sys-

    tem under consideration, and the relative ns-3 implementation is not available
    to the research

    community. A complete framework for the simulation and emulation of EH-WSNs has
    been pro-

    posed in Dall’Ora et al. (2014). The framework allows the reuse of the same code
    written for the

    simulations in real-world WSN deployments and, for this reason, relies heavily
    on the architecture

    of a specific wireless sensor node.

    More recently, an extension to the ns-3 energy framework presented in Wu et al.
    (2011) that

    introduces the concept of an energy harvester has been proposed in Tapparello
    et al. (2014). Using

    this framework, different energy harvester models can be developed as independent
    ns-3 objects,

    and can then be connected to the current and future energy source implementations.
    In addition

    to the definition of the general interface, the framework includes the implementation
    of two sim-

    ple models for the energy harvester: a basic energy harvester, where the energy
    provided by the

    harvester varies over time according to a customizable generic random variable,
    and an energy

    harvester that recharges the energy source with an amount of energy gathered from
    a dataset of

    real solar panel measurements.

    Ekho, a tool to record and emulate energy-harvesting conditions is presented in
    Hester et al.

    (2014). Ekho is generally applicable to a wide range of harvesting technologies,
    and uses a novel

    method to explore and record an energy-harvesting environment by modulating the
    load using a

    precisely controlled digital potentiometer. The energy-harvesting environment
    (Solar, RF) is pro-

    cessed and stored to be later replayed through a custom analog front-end that
    serves as a current

    source.

    PERFORMANCE METRICS AND MODELING OF EH-WSNS

    A metric is a measure for quantitatively evaluating the performance of a system
    (Khan et al. 2012;

    O’Donohoe 2008). In computer networks, metrics are important as design factors,
    and the network

    performance is generally evaluated based on specific metrics for each network
    layer (Akkaya and

    ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, Vol. 14, No. 2, Article 10. Publication date:
    April 2018.

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:29

    Fig. 5. Design metrics for traditional WSNs and for EH-WSNs.

    Younis 2003). In traditional wireless sensor networks, the most important metrics
    contributing to

    the design and performance evaluation are quality of service (QoS) and network
    lifetime (Akyildiz

    et al. 2002; Yahaya et al. 2009). Network lifetime is the time span from the deployment
    of the WSN

    to the instant when the network is considered nonfunctional (Chen and Zhao 2005).
    With respect

    to QoS, network lifetime can be determined based on how long the network is able
    to meet the

    QoS requirements of the end user/application. Thus, network lifetime is the time
    until which the

    network stops providing the required QoS in a given network.

    QoS seeks to evaluate how the network meets the needs of the application. QoS
    is application-

    specific and can be measured in different ways. For example, in environmental
    monitoring systems,

    minimizing the probability of false alarm (PFA) and maintaining a high probability
    of detection

    (PD) are essential for reliability, as this leads to more accurate results that
    are used for decision

    making (Dutta et al. 2005). As another example, in determining the QoS in an application
    for

    tracking animals, the interest may be in the expected accuracy of the location
    of the animal in a

    given time (Perillo and Heinzelman 2005).

    While application QoS is an applicable metric in EH-WSNs, unlike traditional WSNs,
    EH-WSNs

    can be operational with a continuous energy supply, through energy-neutral operation.
    Alter-

    natively, EH-WSNs can also harvest and store energy that the sensor nodes can
    use to perform

    sensing, processing, and communications operations at a later time, which makes
    the network

    lifetime no longer a design requirement for EH-WSNs. In EH-WSNs, instead, designers
    and ap-

    plication developers are concerned with the network uptime (i.e., the percentage
    of time during

    which the network remains active and provides the required application QoS). Hence,
    as shown

    in Figure 5, this is the main difference between performance metrics for traditional
    WSNs and for

    EH-WSNs.

    Guaranteed Qos under worst-case scenarios are required in some applications that
    implement

    EH-WSNs. Therefore, performance modeling and analysis of the network must be executed,
    which

    can be challenging due the probabilistic nature of the network load and energy-harvesting
    pat-

    terns. Schmitt and Roedig (2005a) proposed one of the first analytical frameworks
    to perform

    traffic analysis under worst-case scenarios using deterministic network calculus.
    The proposed

    framework also demonstrated the interdependencies between the node power consumption,
    buffer

    requirements and information delay. Moreover, an extension of their framework
    to compute the

    worst-case topology in terms of delay and buffer requirements, to provide performance
    analy-

    sis for multiple sinks, and for cluster-tree WSNs were proposed in Schmitt and
    Roedig (2005b),

    Schmitt et al. (2006), and Koubaa et al. (2006), respectively. Even though these
    models provided a

    basic framework for traffic analysis, they did not take into account the energy
    constraint of WSNs.

    To overcome the limitations in these frameworks, a stochastic network calculus
    (SNC) approach

    that models the harvested and consumed energy using stochastic charging and discharging
    rates

    was proposed in Wu et al. (2012). This framework provided the upper and lower
    bounds on the

    node residual energy levels, the stochastic performance of the network delay,
    and an analysis of

    multiple energy sources in the system. This model does not take into account overflow
    due to the

    finite-energy storage capacity, and energy underflow when the battery runs out
    of energy. Wang

    and Simon (2016) extended this work by incorporating energy-harvesting rate, energy
    overflow

    and depletion using the SNC approach by modeling the node’s energy resources as
    the amount of

    service that can be provided for the incoming traffic. When receiving traffic,
    the node checks it

    resources and only accepts it if there are enough tokens. Otherwise, the traffic
    is discarded. Upper

    and lower bounds on network delay, wasted energy, and lost packets were derived
    using SNC.

    IMPLEMENTATIONS OF ENERGY-HARVESTING WSNS

    In the previous sections, we discussed the unique features of EH-WSNs, including
    the sensor node

    architecture, energy storage technologies and capacities, energy-neutral operation,
    energy pre-

    diction models, and communication protocols. The main difference between traditional
    WSNs and

    EH-WSNs relates to the network lifetime: whereas traditional WSNs are constrained
    with energy,

    and hence optimize for network lifetime, EH-WSNs are designed with an emphasis
    placed on the

    percentage uptime of the network, because they can operate via energy neutrality
    or achieve es-

    sentially infinite lifetime when deployed in environments with a constant energy
    supply.

    In this section, we present recent implementations of Energy-Harvesting Wireless
    Sensor Net-

    works (EH-WSNs) for the following environmental applications: Animal Tracking
    (AT), Air Qual-

    ity Monitoring (AQM), Water Quality Monitoring (WQM), and Disaster Monitoring
    (DM). In these

    environmental applications, different application-specific protocols are designed
    to meet the cri-

    teria set for the system to achieve high performance.

    7.1

    Animal Tracking

    EH-WSNs are used for animal tracking to provide information about different animals
    species

    (Zhang et al. 2004; Sorber et al. 2013; Woias et al. 2014). Information gathered
    in these systems

    include data on the animals’ habits, behaviors, and habitat conditions; this information
    can help

    researchers develop a better understanding of the status and dynamics of wildlife
    resources, and

    hence can provide the basis for the effective protection, sustainable use, and
    scientific management

    of wildlife resources (Zhang et al. 2014). In such applications, the QoS metrics
    may include the

    expected accuracy of the target location estimates provided by the sensor network
    (Perillo and

    Heinzelman 2005) as well as the fairness of the system based on the per-node packet
    delivery rate

    (Sorber et al. 2013).

    Energy-harvesting technologies have been used in tracking animals with projects
    such as

    ZebraNet for tracking Zebras (Zhang et al. 2004), TurtleNet for studying the Gopher
    tortoise (Sor-

    ber et al. 2013, 2013), tracking Cervus elaphus (a type of deer) in their environment
    to keep them

    from becoming an endangered species (Zhang et al. 2014), tracking sheeps (Woias
    et al. 2014), and

    elephants tracking in Wijesundara et al. (2016). Energy-harvesting-based sensor
    nodes are fitted

    to these animals to gather sensor data and transfer this sensed data to a mobile
    base station or to

    other nodes within a specified range (Gilbert and Balouchi 2008). To power these
    sensor nodes, the

    main sources of energy for these implementations are rechargeable batteries and
    solar energy or

    vibration energy. For example, a Li-Ion (2A-hr, 45g) battery was recharged using
    a solar panel for

    the ZebraNet, TurtleNet and Cervus eaphus implementations (Zhang et al. 2004,
    2014), while the

    sensor nodes of JumboNet were powered through a kinetic energy harvester (Wijesundara
    et al.

    2016).

    Generally in environmental systems, the energy of the system is largely consumed
    by the radio

    and the GPS during sensing, transmission, and reception. To minimize energy consumption
    in such

    applications, different approaches have been adopted. In Zhang et al. (2004),
    to minimize the energy

    al. 2004) and (b) JumboNet

    consumption and to maximize the performance of different components on the sensor
    devices,

    separate power supplies were designed for each module, which were turned off independently

    of each other. However, in Sorber et al. (2013), an adaptive sensing technique
    was used to adjust

    the application behavior to match the sensor nodes’ energy budget so that the
    sensor nodes do

    not exhaust their battery energy. Although these systems provide mechanisms to
    minimize the

    amount of energy consumed by the sensor nodes, no specific energy prediction model
    has been

    proposed to forecast the amount of energy that can be harvested for future use.

    We provide a detailed description of ZebraNet to illustrate the use of solar harvesters
    and sen-

    sor nodes for tracking animals in their natural environment. ZebraNet was designed
    to monitor

    and track the movement of zebras in Kenya to support research work by biologists
    in the Mpala

    Research Center (Zhang et al. 2004). The system consisted of sensor nodes built
    into collars that

    were placed on the zebras. The sensor nodes had integrated GPS to locate the animals
    to deter-

    mine patterns in migration as well as habitats. The system used a total of 14
    solar modules, each

    producing a maximum of 7mA at 5V. The extra harvested energy was used to recharge
    a 2mA-H

    lithium-ion battery, which was utilized at night and during periods where there
    was low or no

    sunlight (especially during bad weather conditions). The batteries provided up
    to 72h of normal

    operation without recharge, and charging normally took place when the voltage
    was near 4.2V.

    Figure 6(a) shows a sensor node with a solar energy harvester placed around the
    neck of a zebra

    to track its movement (Zhang et al. 2004).

    Zebras are mobile, and they spread over long distances covering several kilometers.
    To track

    these zebras, ZebraNet collars are placed around the necks of a selected number
    of zebras, creat-

    ing a sparse network. In this sparse network, nodes communicate through pairwise
    connections

    between two zebras within a single hop when the collars come in contact with each
    other. Data is

    transferred to a manned mobile base station periodically from several zebras.
    The radio connec-

    tivity is maintained within a range of 1–5km. The radio is activated every two
    hours to search for

    nodes in range and allows for data transmission of recorded positions to the immediate
    neighbor.

    The radios are powered off after 5min of activation to conserve energy. Information
    propagation

    is performed either by the use of flooding or history-based protocols within the
    network and the

    base station (BS). When a flooding-based routing approach is used, the nodes communicate
    data

    to their neighbors whenever they meet, and when the history-based routing protocol
    is used, each

    node is assigned a probability of sending data to the base station based on its
    history of successful

    communication with the base station (Boukerche 2008). This routing technique allows
    the BS to

    receive the data from all of the collared zebras in range (Zhang et al. 2004).

    Air Quality Monitoring

    Human activities affect the quality of air, since high volumes of smoke are emitted
    from factories

    and cars, which increases the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide
    (CO2) leading

    to the increasing effects of global warming (WHO 2014). The utilization of EH-WSNs
    in air quality

    monitoring (AQM) aids in the detection of air pollutants such as particulate matter
    (PM), carbon

    dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) (Morelli
    et al. 2016;

    Sardini and Serpelloni 2011; Touati et al. 2015; Chottirapong et al. 2015; Wang
    et al. 2012). EH-WSNs

    for air quality monitoring can be installed indoors or outdoors, with the main
    difference being in

    the amount of energy harvested from the environment. For outdoor AQM systems,
    solar cells is an

    obvious energy-harvesting technique but must be accompanied by energy storage,
    management

    and prediction to provide high efficiency and overcome the obstacles in harvesting
    solar energy,

    such as varying weather conditions.

    A thermal solar hybrid energy-harvesting implementation for air quality monitoring
    is provided

    in Chottirapong et al. (2015). The authors looked at the possibility of harvesting
    energy from

    organic fertilizer plant waste to monitor air pollution in terms of ammonia gas
    concentration.

    The first part of the system is the energy harvester. A thermoelectric generator
    (TEG) is used to

    convert the difference between the hot and cold sides of a gas deodorizer tank—used
    for treating

    the polluted air—from heat energy into electrical energy. To increase the power
    to operate the

    ammonia sensor and the transmission module in the morning, solar cells are proposed.
    BQ25570,

    which is an Ultra Low Power Harvester Power Management IC with Boost Charger (Instruments

    2015b), is used as the power conditioner for interfacing DC sources, which stabilizes
    the output

    voltage that is stored in a combined 1F super-capacitor and Li-Ion battery to
    provide continuous

    voltage levels. The last part is the energy management in which an MSP430G2231
    (Instruments

    2013a) Texas Instruments low power consumption micro-controller is used. The results
    show that

    the TEG and the solar cells provide up to 15mW and 275mW, respectively, while
    the consumption

    of the nodes is only about 55mW, which allows the system to be working all day.
    The STM32W

    RF module standard version DZ-ZB-GA is used as a radio frequency transmission
    module, which

    operates using the ZigBee protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). Table 10 provides examples
    of existing EH-

    WSNs used for air quality monitoring.

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:33

    7.3

    Water Quality Monitoring

    In recent times, water bodies have suffered from damaging human activities such
    as mining, man-

    ufacturing, and the production of goods. Harmful chemicals and waste products
    from homes and

    industrial activities are dumped into various water bodies, thereby polluting
    them (Owa 2014).

    Thus, water quality monitoring remains an interesting application area where EH-WSNs
    can

    be used to monitor different conditions to ensure safe drinking water. Self-autonomous
    wireless

    sensor networks with sensor nodes that harvest energy from their operating environment
    can pro-

    vide water quality monitoring in rural and residential areas. Energy can be harvested
    from solar,

    thermal, and mechanical sources to support this type of environmental application,
    which requires

    constant energy for measuring parameters such as temperature, pH, conductivity,
    turbidity, and

    dissolved oxygen (DO). Apart from monitoring drinking water for humans, water
    quality moni-

    toring can be performed to improve life in aquatic environments. For example,
    WQM can be used

    to monitor the temperature, pH, and DO in fish farms to maintain constant conditions
    for the fish.

    To monitor water quality, devices have been designed to harvest energy from flowing
    water

    using piezoelectric polymers, including use of a flag-shaped piezoelectric polymer
    harvester and

    micro-structured piezo-bimorph generator (Pobering and Schwesinger 2004), Intellisonde
    probe

    (to measure water flow, temperature, and pressure) (Ye and Soga 2011), and an
    energy-harvesting

    eel (Taylor et al. 2001). Although these technologies have not yet been fully
    harnessed and imple-

    mented for monitoring water quality in a WSN environment, advances in the manufacturing
    of

    wireless sensor nodes are expected to increase to support the implementation of
    these technologies

    for water quality monitoring.

    An example WQM system with energy-harvesting implementation is provided in Wang
    (2012a).

    In their work, the authors proposed an energy-harvesting system for monitoring
    and management

    of aquaculture (i.e., fishery water quality monitoring) to collect, process, and
    transmit environ-

    mental parameters on fish farming. The wireless sensor network was designed to
    detect water

    temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Electrical Conductivity, and water level. WQM
    sensors, such

    as the pH sensor and the turbidity sensor, were installed to sense specific phenomenon,
    and the

    collected data were transmitted to a remote WQM station for data processing. The
    system used

    two different sets of nodes. The sub-node included one printed circuit board (PCB)
    and a set of

    500mAh Li-MnO2 coin batteries. The main node was encapsulated with a 4000mAh rechargeable

    Li-Ion battery inside a water proof case and consisted of four PCB boards: main
    board, interface

    board, sensor board and sensor area network (SAN) board. ZigBee communication
    standard was

    used by the nodes to transfer data among them, and GSM/GPRS was used as the standard
    for

    communicating between the nodes in the pumping station and the control center.

    7.4

    Health Monitoring

    Wireless sensor nodes can be deployed for preventive healthcare as a wireless
    body area network

    (WBAN), to monitor the human body functions and physical attributes, which arguably
    can en-

    hance an individual’s health through continuous monitoring and reduce the cost
    of health mon-

    itoring (Cavallari et al. 2014; Noel et al. 2017). Energy harvesting from various
    sources such as

    biochemical and biomechanical sources from the human body, in addition to scavenging
    ambient

    energy, enables WBANs to be more practical by reducing their system size and cost
    (Akhtar and

    Rehmani 2017).

    The human body wastes about 100W in heat, which can be harvested by thermoelectric
    genera-

    tors (TEG), and utilized to power WBANs (Saida et al. 2016). As an example, an
    experimental study

    of the thermal human properties of the human body with an attached thermoelectric
    harvester

    (TEH) is carried out in Leonov (2013), and shows that the TEH device is capable
    of powering

    10:34

    K. S. Adu-Manu et al.

    low-power health monitoring devices such as wireless electrocardiography through
    body heat

    harvesting. Similarly, an autonomous wearable sensor node with a bendable amorphous
    PV panel

    to harvest solar power, a super-capacitor to store energy, and an ultra low-power
    circuitry is

    proposed in Toh et al. (2014). RF transmissions from commercial telecommunications,
    especially

    the 900/1800MHz cellular system, represent a reliable ambient energy that could
    be harvested to

    power wearable biomedical sensors (Borges et al. 2015). For instance, a battery-less
    sensor with

    efficiency tracking RF energy harvester and a whip antenna has been proposed in
    Xia et al. (2014).

    Practical experiments show that the system can successfully measure and transmit
    abdominal

    temperature to a base station for a distance up to 9m.

    7.5

    Structural Health Monitoring

    Monitoring the performance of structures is important as it can provide advanced
    warning on

    damages and potential collapses. Furthermore, using WSNs for structural health
    monitoring (SHM)

    was found to be superior compared to conventional wired systems due to their low
    cost, ease of

    implementation and their effective data management (Jang et al. 2010; Banerji
    et al. 2016). In this

    section, we provide three diverse examples of SHM systems based on the type of
    harvested energy

    and the structure.

    A solar powered WSN was proposed in Jang et al. (2010) to monitor the structural
    health of

    a cable stayed bridge using 70 Imote2 sensor nodes to cover the 484m Jindo bridge
    length. The

    system uses 9V-350mA solar panels to power a lithium-polymer rechargeable battery
    with a total

    capacity of 10,000mAh. Moreover, in Cahill et al. (2014), a piezoelectric material
    is used to detect

    any damage in a reinforced concrete beam through voltage shift, which is simultaneously
    used to

    power the wireless sensor node. Based on experimental tests, it was found that
    the output voltage

    from the energy harvester is capable of detecting localized damage in the structure.
    Furthermore,

    an SHM system to monitor concrete and steel deformation using a vibrating wire
    strain gauge

    in an underground train tunnel is implemented in Cammarano et al. (2013). The
    system uses six

    Telos B motes with micro wind turbines to harvest energy, which is stored in a
    super-capacitor.

    The results show that the energy harvested by each node varies significantly based
    on its location

    in the tunnel, and its value ranges from 5 to 132mJ, which allows at least one
    strain measurement

    per day.

    7.6

    Disaster Monitoring

    Natural disasters like earthquakes and flooding cause severe impact on humanity
    in terms of life,

    financial costs, and emotional turmoil (Rasaneh and Banirostam 2013). Preventing,
    managing, or

    at least mitigating their effects is a major challenge due to the unpredictable,
    short-span, and

    high-impact nature of these disasters. This has led to some research focusing
    on using vibration-

    based energy-harvesting WSNs to monitor or even manage the effects of natural
    disasters (Hande

    et al. 2010; Mihajlovic et al. 2015; Cheng et al. 2013). A flooding monitoring
    system that har-

    vests energy from a 2V, 150mA solar panel that charges a 0.47F super-capacitor
    is implemented in

    Mihajlovic et al. (2015). A BQ25570 power management IC is used as the power conditioner
    with an

    MSP430G2553 (Instruments 2013b) Texas Instruments low power consumption micro-controller.

    The results show that a maximum of 0.3W can be harvested with this setup. The
    design of the

    network was based on clustering. Three main sensor nodes were used in the clustering
    setup (i.e.,

    vibration, temperature, and acoustic sensor nodes) (Rasaneh and Banirostam 2013).
    In each clus-

    ter, cluster-heads and the base station have more computing power and energy.
    The Event-Driven

    Energy-Harvesting (EDEH) MAC protocol was used to address channel contention under
    strin-

    gent energy constraints. The protocol used a large backoff exponent and spread
    access of devices

    CHALLENGES AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

    While much work has been done on EH-WSNs, as described in this article, there
    are still a number

    of challenges that require future research to address.

    8.1

    Challenges

    8.1.1

    Universal Harvester Design. Energy-harvesting techniques still have drawbacks
    that affect

    their net performance, i.e., solar energy does not work at night or during bad
    weather conditions,

    vibration energy harvesters produce very low power unless there is a considerable
    size vibration,

    RF energy harvesting works on limited bands only and its power declines rapidly
    with distance,

    and thermal energy harvesting only works well when there is a large heat difference.
    Hence, there

    is a need to design a multi-source harvester that can harvest energy from various
    environmental

    sources to comply with the sensor nodes’ energy needs (Shaikh and Zeadally 2016a).
    Furthermore,

    due to the variability of the available energy from the environment, designing
    a power condition-

    ing subsystem that can adapt to this unpredictability is a major challenge in
    the design of energy

    harvesters (Yang et al. 2014).

    8.1.2

    Energy-Harvesting Modeling. Although a practical recharge model for WISP tags
    is de-

    veloped based on extensive experimental data in He et al. (2013), stochastic statistical
    modeling of

    harvested environmental energy remains a challenging task, as in most cases natural
    resources can

    be variable and unpredictable (Gunduz et al. 2014). Implementing learning algorithms
    such as the

    Q-learning algorithm that models the harvested energy rate, channel conditions
    and data arrival

    as Markov processes can lead to an optimal transmission strategy (Blasco et al.
    2013). However,

    as the number of nodes increases, a longer learning time would be required to
    reach this optimal

    strategy. In addition, achieving an optimal transmission state for all the nodes
    leads to more com-

    plex algorithms as the data arrival rate at the nodes is coupled with the transmission
    rate of other

    nodes (Gunduz et al. 2014).

    8.1.3

    Network Energy Optimization. Sensor nodes may have different energy consumption
    lev-

    els based on their location, transmission power, and the network architecture
    used (e.g., clusters,

    chain, tree, etc.). In a single-hop network, nodes that are farther from the sink
    will require more

    transmission power to get their data to the sink, while in a multi-hop network,
    nodes that are closer

    to the sink will need more power to route sensed information from other nodes
    to the sink. Al-

    though existing protocols such as the work in Huang and Neely (2013), have attempted
    to manage

    power and balance energy consumed by nodes in the network, network energy optimization
    still

    remains a challenge in energy-harvesting WSNs, where nodes have different energy-harvesting

    rates that should be considered when managing the network.

    8.2

    Future Directions

    8.2.1

    Network Wide Protocol Design. Existing WSN protocols are designed to efficiently
    man-

    age the amount of energy consumed by sensor nodes, while EH-WSN protocols are
    designed to

    improve the network uptime, under fairness, throughput, and delay constraints.
    To meet these re-

    quirements under variable energy-harvesting rates, sensor nodes must collect information
    about

    the other sensors in the network. Some protocols proposed for EH-WSNs have been
    shown to

    achieve energy-neutral operation for individual nodes by optimizing parameters
    in the physical,

    MAC, and network layers. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, protocols
    for network-

    wide optimization of EH-WSNs have not been fully explored. As a result, research
    on novel pro-

    tocols that can achieve Network Neutral Operation (NNO), instead of individual
    node ENO, can

    greatly benefit the overall system performance.

    8.2.2

    Prediction Models. Due to the dynamic nature of the energy-harvesting sources,
    re-

    searchers pay much attention to the amount and the rate of energy that can be
    harvested over

    time to predict the network uptime. Prediction models such as Genetic Machine
    Learning Ap-

    proach (GMLA) (de Araújo et al. 2014), an optimized Markov model using Oriented
    Birth-Death

    (OBD) (de Araújo et al. 2012), and Data Driven Link Quality Prediction (DDLQP)
    (Liu and Cerpa

    2014) have been proposed for link quality prediction in mobile WSNs. Also, solar
    energy prediction

    models such as Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average (EWMA) (Piorno et al. 2009;
    Moser et al.

    2007), SunCast (Lu and Whitehouse 2012), and Pro-Energy (Cammarano et al. 2012)
    are designed

    based on the solar energy availability. There are also prediction models proposed
    for energy har-

    vesting that use wind as the energy source. Examples of wind energy prediction
    models include

    the adaptive AC-DC converter and a hybrid voltage rectifier using linear regression
    (Porcarelli

    et al. 2015) and Combinational Prediction Model (CPM) for short-term wind farm
    output power

    based on meteorological data collected by a WSN (Ma et al. 2014). These prediction
    models are

    designed to predict the amount of energy to be harvested at the node and not the
    entire network.

    These models are also utilized at different levels of the protocol stack to estimate
    the amount

    of energy to be harvested by the node to achieve ENO. Hence, communication protocols
    should

    be designed to combine different energy prediction models for different nodes
    to achieve Network

    Neutral Operation (NNO), and network-wide prediction models should be thoroughly
    investigated

    by researchers.

    8.2.3

    Energy-Harvesting Wearable Devices. Conventional human activity recognition (HAR)
    re-

    lies on an accelerometer, which consumes relatively high amounts of energy and
    can be a bot-

    tleneck in situations where small amounts of energy is harvested (Khalifa et al.
    2015). Hence,

    researchers have started to explore the possibility of using the harvested kinetic
    energy to clas-

    sify human activities based on the fact that each activity generates a different
    amount of energy.

    Enhancing the design of EH-HAR devices to match the accuracy of conventional HAR
    that use

    accelerometer in classifying various human motions, is still an open area to explore.

    8.2.4

    Energy-Harvesting Channel Capacity. In WSNs without energy harvesting, the available

    energy for transmission is deterministic and Shannon’s capacity formula can be
    used to design

    efficient communication systems. On the other hand, for energy-harvesting communication
    sys-

    tems, the available energy for information transmission can be unpredictable and
    is modeled as a

    stochastic process (Shaviv et al. 2016). Several of the research studies in EH-WSNs
    have focused

    April 2018.

    Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs): A Review

    10:37

    on the capacity of EH channel with a finite battery (Shaviv et al. 2016; Mao and
    Hassibi 2017; Chen

    et al. 2017), whereas other studies have focused on channels in which energy is
    harvested in bi-

    nary units (either 0 or 1 unit) and is stored in a unit-sized battery (Tutuncuoglu
    et al. 2013, 2017).

    For instance, Shaviv et al. (2016) proved that, in an EH channel with a battery
    size larger than the

    maximum energy that can be harvested, the information-theoretic capacity of the
    EH channel is

    approximately equal to the capacity of an AWGN channel with an average power constraint
    equal

    to the average energy-harvesting rate.

    Since the harvested energy is unpredictable and can be insufficient for information
    transmission

    at some instances, channel capacity limits pose a major challenge in recent EH
    systems. Hence,

    further theoretical research work is required for determining the channel capacity
    of these systems

    under different energy-harvesting processes and for deriving efficient communication
    policies in

    multi-user settings.

    8.2.5

    Joint Transmitter-Receiver Network Performance Analysis for EH systems. In EH-WSNs,
    en-

    ergy scheduling at the transmitter side has been at the center of discussion by
    some researchers,

    since it is mostly assumed that the power at the receiver is constant in supply
    using some conven-

    tional power source (Satpathi et al. 2016). Due to this limitation, researchers
    have begun study-

    ing the performance of energy-harvesting receivers (EHRs), information decoding
    and processing

    costs, which led to some energy-harvesting transmitter-receiver schemes provided
    in Arafa and

    Ulukus (2015) and Satpathi et al. (2016). Nevertheless, understanding the energy
    issues at the re-

    ceiver side, in addition to developing decoding and transmission policies, still
    remains an open

    area for further exploration.

    8.2.6

    New Communication Technologies (Non-RF Technologies). Communication is an impor-

    tant aspect of WSNs. Communication in WSNs can be local (i.e., between nodes and
    the sink) or

    remote (i.e., between the sink and a remote monitoring center). There are a number
    of conventional

    communication technologies (or protocols) that are used in WSNs include ZigBee,
    WiMax, WiFi,

    LTE, GPRS, and GSM. In addition, there are newer technologies that could also
    be explored like

    Visible Light Communication (VLC), underwater optical/acoustic communication,
    wireless under-

    ground communication, and Narrow-band Internet of Things (NB-IoT). NB-IoT is a
    radio access

    technology that aims to enhance the GSM and LTE standards for IoT applications
    in addition to

    providing coverage extension and enhancing battery lifetime (Wang et al. 2016a).
    Implementing

    these technologies in EH-WSNs might require the design of new communication protocols.
    To fully

    implement these new technologies, researchers should look into new ways to design
    the physical

    layer protocols to accommodate these technologies within the context of energy
    harvesting.

    CONCLUSIONS

    Wireless sensor networks play a pivotal role in monitoring the environment. Over
    the years,

    energy management techniques have been shown to prolong the lifetime of sensor
    devices in

    monitoring the environment, but the amount of energy required by sensors to operate
    for a long

    time still remains a challenge. Hence, the use of energy harvesters to support
    the existing power

    management schemes is essential. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive
    study of the

    current state-of-the-art techniques for harvesting energy to increase the lifetime
    of sensor nodes

    in WSN environments. We first discussed the energy-harvesting sources that are
    currently used

    to support WSNs operation and then presented the technologies used for harvesting
    the differ-

    ent energy sources. In addition, we discussed the unique features of EH-WSNs and
    their differ-

    ent energy prediction and management techniques, with a particular emphasis on
    their impact

    on the design of energy-harvesting-aware communication protocols. Finally, we
    presented recent

    implementations of EH-WSNs for environmental applications. Despite the large body
    of work in

    this area, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed to make
    EH-WSNs mainstream.

    irrigation management can contribute to the efficient use of water resources and
    enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing demand for food.
  verbatim_quote2: In addition to presenting the technologies for harvesting energy
    from ambient sources and the protocols that can take advantage of the harvested
    energy, we present new techniques that do not just consider energy-based metrics
    (such as the effective energy, cumulative energy usage, energy value), link quality,
    and duty cycling for route selection, but we also consider previous knowledge
    of the network and energy count to determine the route based on the energy harvesting
    of the nodes in the path and the status of future path hops and not only the next
    hop to select routes.

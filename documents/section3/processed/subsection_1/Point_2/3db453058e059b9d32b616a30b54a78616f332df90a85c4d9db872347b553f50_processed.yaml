    and measuring meteorological and physiological parameters of humans, animals,
    and plants are necessary to understand the complex interactions that occur between
    atmospheric processes and the health of the living organisms. Advanced sensing
    technologies have provided both meteorological and biological data across increasingly
    vast spatial, spectral, temporal, and thematic scales. Information and communication
    technologies have reduced barriers to data dissemination, enabling the circulation
    of information across different jurisdictions and disciplines. Due to the advancement
    and rapid dissemination of these technologies, a review of the opportunities for
    sensing the health effects of weather and climate change is necessary. This paper
    provides such an overview by focusing on existing and emerging technologies and
    their opportunities and challenges for studying the health effects of weather
    and climate change on humans, animals, and plants. Similar content being viewed

    16 June 2022 Introduction Technological advancements have greatly facilitated
    data acquisition across disciplines, leading to innovations in the cross-disciplinary
    field of biometeorology. This field of science focuses on the interactions between
    the biosphere (i.e., all living organisms, including plants, animals, and humans)
    and the Earth’s atmosphere in space and time (Tromp 1980; McGregor 2012; Gosling
    et al. 2014). The diverse field of biometeorology allows for the collaboration
    of many disciplines including, but not limited to, meteorology, geography, biology,
    mathematics and statistics, environmental science, animal welfare and behavior,
    urban climatology, epidemiology, public health, and physiology. Measuring and
    sensing contribute to our understanding of climatological, biological, and physiological
    processes. This can inform and optimize climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    For example, rising temperatures have been found to have an adverse impact on
    human, animal, and plant health (Cavicchioli et al. 2019; Harwatt 2019). In this
    respect, data acquisition is a key component of studying and understanding the
    complex interactions that occur between atmospheric processes and the health of
    the living world. As such, biometeorology is reliant on the sensing and measurement
    of these physiological parameters. Newly designed sensing technologies have provided
    both meteorological and biological data across increasingly vast spatial, spectral,
    and temporal scales, and further across unprecedented thematic scales. Addressing
    the cross-sectoral impacts of weather and climate change requires an “un-siloed”
    and multi-disciplinary approach. Furthermore, information and communication technologies
    have dramatically reduced barriers to data dissemination enabling the circulation
    of information across countries and disciplines faster and more reliably than
    ever. Researchers and practitioners alike benefit from the use of a wide array
    of measurement technologies to advance research, especially on the health effects
    of weather and climate change. Due to the rapid growth and advancement of sensing
    technologies, a comprehensive review of the opportunities for sensing the health
    effects of weather and climate change is necessary. Thus, the goal of this paper
    is to present the state of scientific development of existing and emerging sensing
    technologies used in biometeorological studies, building upon a recent short communication
    by Mehdipoor et al. (2017). To this end, we provide an overview of existing and
    emerging technologies that are used or have the potential for use in understanding
    the health effects of weather and climate change on humans, animals, and plants.
    Furthermore, we review challenges that may be encountered in the use and deployment
    of these technologies. Current and emerging technologies are introduced and organized
    by scale and their direct relevance for study of human, animal, and plant biometeorology.
    Finally, sensing parameters and approaches used across these scales are presented
    for addressing novel challenges in the study of human, animal, and plant health
    in relation to weather and climate change. Systematic review A systemic review
    was undertaken to identify relevant literature on biometeorological sensing technologies.
    Multiple search engines were used in this review including Google Scholar, Web
    of Science, Scopus, Scholars Portal, ProQuest, and the University of Twente and
    University of Toronto digital databases. The search keywords were grouped into
    themes as presented in Table 1. Table 1 Keywords and search terms Full size table
    Recent advances and newly developed techniques in biometeorological monitoring
    were prioritized over conventional or historical technologies. A total of 2395
    items were located through database searches as shown in Fig. 1. This was complemented
    by a review of conference papers, books, and publications from various governmental
    and international organizations. A total of 267 studies were included as part
    of this review paper. Fig. 1 Overview of studies identified in the steps of the
    systematic review process derived from the PRISMA flow diagram (source: Moher
    et al. 2009) Full size image Scale of sensing technologies Interactions between
    the atmosphere and biosphere are bidirectional with the mechanisms that alter
    atmospheric processes to human, animal, and plant health issues occurring at different
    scales in space and time (Hungate and Koch 2015; Suni et al. 2015). Understanding
    the influence of scale on the dynamics of the atmosphere—biosphere system is fundamental
    to the selection of technologies and methods for undertaking biometeorological
    measurements. New and emerging technologies offer opportunities for undertaking
    biometeorological studies at various scales. Pulido Barrera et al. 2018used qualitative
    spatial classes (i.e., individual, local, regional, and global) to conceptualize
    metabolic processes for organisms, populations, ecosystems, and landscapes in
    urban areas. Generic quantitative approaches have been defined highlighting the
    spatial and temporal scale of biological processes (Munns 2002; Jorgensen and
    Nielsen 2013; Suni et al. 2015). As with biological processes, atmospheric processes
    are ordered across space and time (Oke 2008), yet both processes are so often
    illustrated in separate space-time diagrams. Figure 2 shows the relationship between
    these two conceptual views, with space representing the main medium of coincidence
    of both processes. Fig. 2 Spatial and temporal diagram illustrating the occurrence
    of both biological processes (levels of biological organization) and atmospheric
    processes (climatic scales) Full size image Sensing and measurement technologies
    have different temporal scales of measurement and are dependent on the spatial
    scale. For human and animal vitals, the temporal scale can be seconds or less.
    For microscale weather data, measurements are taken by the minute to the hour.
    Other sensing technologies such as satellite monitoring and their derived products
    are less granular, ranging from every 15 min to hourly and monthly outputs. Table
    2 summarizes different examples of technologies and sensors related to physiological
    processes, environmental conditions, and behavioral factors of humans, animals,
    and plants for various spatial scales. This table includes both traditional meteorological
    scales including micro-, meso-, and macro-scales according to Oke (2007), as well
    as individual-scale technologies. It also illustrates whether the technology can
    be used for animal, plant, and/or human applications. It should be noted that
    there is an unequal distribution of technological advancements across the three
    main fields of biometeorology, with a greater emphasis on human applications.
    Table 2 Spatial scales and examples of related biometeorological research topics
    (adapted from Oke 2006 and Muller et al. 2013) Full size table Individual and
    micro-scale sensing Microscale technology has the potential to enable the smart
    monitoring of plants, soils, and environmental conditions required to implement
    a new generation of precision agriculture practices that will further optimize
    agricultural production and reduce costs and environmental impacts (Stafford 2000;
    Shang et al. 2019). Moreover, these sensors can be used to create Internet of
    Things (IoT) networks for various applications, for instance, to measure environmental
    conditions such as relative humidity (Ganeshkumar et al. 2016), or to detect diseases
    such as bacterial leaf spot on peppers and tomatoes (Kwak et al. 2017). In terms
    of animal biometeorology, microchip technologies can be used to evaluate the effect
    of weather variation on sperm motility in livestock (de Wagenaar et al. 2016).
    In addition, smart sensors such as microneedles, skin patches, skin tattoos, and
    stretchable electronics can be used for physiological sensing with regard to meteorological
    and climatological conditions (Hosu et al. 2019), such as sweat rate through galvanic
    skin response, sodium levels in sweat, skin temperature, and heart rate (Kim and
    Rogers 2008; Harbert et al. 2013; Fan et al. 2014). At the individual scale, wearable,
    implantation, or ingestible monitors and sensors (Dougherty et al. 2009; Gill
    and Sleivert 2001; Kuras et al. 2017) are commonly used in biometeorology to measure
    vital human parameters in both controlled experiments and daily life. Common vital
    signs measured include heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, body temperature,
    cardiac rhythm, skin perspiration, and blood oxygen saturation (Lee et al. 2009;
    Taniguchi et al. 2011; Wakabayashi et al. 2011; Dias and Paulo Silva Cunha 2018).
    In addition, wearable devices are used to measure microclimate conditions and
    individual human exposure to weather. These include iButtons, Kestrel Drops, and
    UV dosimeters that collect data on body and air temperature, humidity, and UV
    radiation (Dias and Paulo Silva Cunha 2018; Hass and Ellis 2019). Accuracy of
    personal heat exposure measurement devices is in a range of ± 0.2–0.5 or ± 2.5–8%
    (Kuras et al. 2017). Another way to assess the effect of weather on individual
    health is through analyzing changes in body chemistry by sampling blood and saliva
    (Celec et al. 2009; Kanikowska et al. 2010). For example, cytokine levels in the
    blood will rise during heat stroke (Leon and Helwig 2010). In addition, portable
    saliva tests are a novel way to test for dehydration caused by heat and activity
    (Lu et al. 2019). Studies to evaluate the thermal status of animals and the dynamics
    of gas exchanges can be undertaken using simple indirect calorimetry setups with
    facial masks, hoods, or heat exchangers to determine metabolic heat production,
    sensible and latent heat transfer, plus enteric methane emissions of ruminants
    (e.g., broilers chickens, Nascimento et al. 2017; dairy cows and beef cattle,
    de Melo Costa et al. 2018). For large animal species, particularly bovines, equids,
    and camelids, this is a novel technological development as it removes the need
    to (a) individually confine animals within climate chambers and (b) further removes
    the need for highly specialized equipment generally required by direct and indirect
    calorimetry studies. This provides opportunities to simultaneously collect data
    from larger cohorts of animals and enables institutions without access to climate
    chambers to conduct this type of research. There are greater challenges in the
    assessment of physiological and behavioral responses in free-ranging wild species
    compared to the less complex livestock environment such as large grazing pastures
    or open confinement areas. In the wilderness context, animals are less predictable,
    and evaluations are performed in much larger territorial areas where animal restraint
    can be a significant challenge. Biologging approaches can be used to assess aspects
    of autonomic and behavioral thermoregulation in free-ranging animals on a large
    temporal scale (Fuller et al. 2014). For ecological purposes, sensors can be applied
    to determine location, patterns in body posture, activity, and vocalization (Williams
    et al. 2019). For instance, body temperatures measured by miniature implanted
    loggers have revealed the importance of adjustments in peripheral blood flow for
    thermoregulation, without requiring human observation (Hetem et al. 2009). There
    are some limitations in the of biologgers such as the use of post hoc statistical
    methods to overcome the limitations of specific sensor data, like machine learning
    approaches to positional and accelerometer data, and the necessity of recapture
    of animals to recover data from on-board devices (Williams et al. 2019). Heart
    rate measurements can be used as a proxy for metabolism in free-ranging animals,
    which reveals their response to food availability in changing environments (Signer
    et al. 2011). Remote monitoring can be used to assess (a) thermoregulatory behavior
    using miniature black globe thermometers, (b) activity patterns using accelerometers,
    and (c) movement using GPS loggers. This can enable the assessment of how free-ranging
    animals adjust their activity spatially and temporally manipulate heat exchange
    (Hetem et al. 2012). At the micro-scale, human thermal exposure in the built environment
    can be evaluated through the use of mobile custom-built human biometeorological
    platforms, such as MaRTy (Middel and Krayenhoff 2019). This moving observational
    platform enables detailed micrometeorological observations of air temperature,
    relative humidity, wind speed, and longwave and shortwave radiant flux densities
    in six directions (Höppe 1992; Ali-Toudert and Mayer 2007). This technology enables
    the assessment of the human health effects of different climatic elements in various
    urban micro-environments. It is important to note that the development of custom-made
    observational biometeorological platforms often requires theoretical knowledge,
    practical skills, and substantial financial resources that constitute a central
    limitation for their adoption in practice. In this respect, more affordable and
    accessible solutions provide less accuracy and granularity of measurement. These
    can include stationary devices, such as weather stations and heat stress meters,
    where incoming radiation is measured with gray or black globe thermometers (Thorsson
    et al. 2007). Other examples include infrared thermography (cameras and thermometers)
    that can be utilized to capture microscale differences in surface temperatures
    of skin and materials (Scharf et al. 2008). Local, regional, and synoptic scale
    sensing At the local scale, a growing number of applications in different research
    disciplines are using UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) because these small instruments
    can carry sensors (e.g., multi-spectral, hyperspectral, and thermal imaging systems).
    These platforms enable monitoring in various environmental conditions. For example,
    UAVs can be used in agriculture to remotely monitor growth conditions, drought
    stress, and crop damage from insects. It can support wildlife monitoring and environmental
    enforcement (Lopez-Tello and Muthukumar 2018). UAVs can also be used in a post-disaster
    assessment of extreme weather events (Adams et al. 2013). Some limitations of
    UAV usage in biometeorological sensing include payload restriction, length of
    the flight, weather conditions, and interference to airspace (von Bueren et al.
    2015). Sensing at the mesoscale focuses on measuring the thermal performance of
    different land-use land cover (LULC) classes, to correlate meteorological conditions
    with health impacts. In this respect, urban meteorological networks are established
    to monitor regional climate and biometeorological conditions (Šećerov et al. 2015).
    These networks represent the conventional paradigm of observations because of
    the significant costs to establish and maintain them; therefore, sustainable approaches
    to monitor urban environments are required. The IoT is a “disruptive” technological
    approach (Chapman 2015) that enables the widespread use of numerous, quality-controlled
    devices to monitor the weather and health-related parameters in various urban
    environments. However, this approach has several limitations. At the regional
    scale, the urban fabric is quite heterogeneous, and assessing the thermal performance
    of different morphological typologies can be challenging because of the following:
    (1) most cities do not have in situ networks dense enough to provide air temperature
    datasets with adequate spatial resolution; and (2) there is a deficit of adequate
    rural reference stations due to an increase in urban sprawl, which means that
    formerly rural stations (particularly located in airports) have become increasingly
    urbanized. Such circumstances prevent detailed spatialization and study of individual
    neighborhood thermal performance. This research pathway uses freely accessible
    satellite thermal imagery to map land surface heat levels, as a proxy for human
    exposure to excess temperatures. In fact, freely available remote sensing satellite
    thermal imagery (such as Landsat, MODIS, Sentinels) provides accessible datasets
    with much greater spatial resolution (from 10 m to 1 km), and with global coverage
    (e.g., Liu and Zhang 2011; Parlow et al. 2014; Arellano and Cladera 2016; Bechtel
    et al. 2019). Specifically, many studies have been dedicated to infer the spatial
    patterns of the urban atmospheric thermal anomaly (urban heat island, UHI) by
    assessing the spatial patterns and intensities of the surface temperatures (surface
    urban heat island, SUHI). While the use of satellite-based thermal imagery is
    beneficial in examining vast spatial landscapes—from forest monitoring (Dorren
    et al. 2003; Hansen et al. 2008) to sea surface temperature dynamics (Kaplan et
    al. 1998; Reynolds et al. 2007), from geologic surfaces differentiation (Syvitski
    et al. 2012) to fire detection (Giglio et al. 2003)—its application to human heat-related
    health research requires an understanding of two circumstances. Firstly, UHI effect
    is not in and of itself damaging to human health, despite controversy on the subject
    (e.g., Manoli et al. 2020; Martilli et al. 2020). Although several research studies
    have reported an increase in UHI intensity during heatwave events, or event UHI-related
    mortality (Heaviside et al. 2016, Lemonsu et al. 2015, Paravantis et al. 2017,
    Tan et al. 2010), it is actually the heatwave event itself (which is a widespread
    regional phenomenon, not restricted to the urban areas) that causes health-related
    consequences. As such, the potential contribution of the urban thermal anomaly
    to excessive heat exposure must be acknowledged. It requires further investigation
    into examples of case study cities across climate regions to be assumed an overall
    certainty. Secondly, even in cases where UHI increases under heatwave conditions
    have been reported, one must consider that surface and air UHI are not synchronous,
    and the former is not necessarily a proxy of the latter. In short, there are several
    limitations to using satellite thermal imagery for mesoscale urban climate studies.
    For urban areas, the sub-kilometer spatial resolution is of greatest interest
    to distinguish the thermal performance of different built-up densities and morphologies.
    For example, only at the 100-m scale is it possible to detect and assess the impact
    of neighborhood scale green areas, such as small parks and community gardens.
    As such, only Landsat satellites offer this spatial resolution in their thermal
    bands, but it presents challenges for continuous monitoring, which is especially
    relevant considering the frequency of non-viable scenes due to extensive cloud
    cover. Another freely available alternative is shorter range satellite-based thermal
    imagery that ranges from 1-km resolution (e.g., MODIS, Sentinel 3 SLSTR) to 5
    km (e.g., SEVERI) or more. Although Landsat 5-8 imagery has an adequate spatial
    resolution, it is acquired during the morning which is least suitable for urban
    climate research, as surfaces in the built environment are not yet warm enough
    to show a significant thermal signal, especially in drier climates where cities
    are not surrounded by dense tree cover (e.g., Oliveira et al. 2020. The ideal
    method to assess UHI from surface thermal imagery is to either have enough daily
    samples (e.g., hourly) to compute a daily SUHI cycle, or to use that data to compute
    the flux components of the urban energy balance (UBE): heat storage, sensible
    heat, and latent heat components. The UBE approach has evolved (Oke 1982; Oke
    1988; Stewart et al. 2014; Oke et al. 2017) and its application to remote sensing
    data has been explored by several urban climate research groups (Rigo et al. 2006;
    Rigo and Parlow 2007; Wicki et al. 2018; Chrysoulakis et al. 2018) with encouraging
    results. Nevertheless, the main challenge is the need for in situ monitoring to
    validate approaches. Flux towers are one method of validating satellite-based
    results but are difficult to access because they require substantial financial
    resources and appropriate site location (Rigo and Parlow 2007; Wicki and Parlow
    2017; Wicki et al. 2018). In cases where flux towers have been constructed (e.g.,
    UrbanFluxes project), there are also challenges in evaluating the accuracy of
    satellite-based results (i.e., each pixel covering several hundreds of square
    meters) given urban spatial heterogeneity. Recent trends in both technological
    solutions and data analytics offer new pathways to overcome monitoring challenges.
    Smaller scale unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) equipped with thermal and multi/hyperspectral
    cameras can collect urban imagery at more suitable times of the day (Gaitani et
    al. 2017; Burud et al. 2018). In addition, merging different data products can
    generate synthetic remote sensing-equivalent imagery, based on complementary datasets
    including satellite imagery from multiple sensors with different spatial and temporal
    scales, and local vector-based geo-information such as built-up contours and land
    use-land cover classification (Zurita-Milla et al. 2009; Weng et al. 2014). New
    satellite systems such as WildFireSat can reduce the time period required to access
    the data after data acquisition from hours or days down to 30 min (van Mierlo
    et al. 2019), allowing for better decision-making in emergency preparedness and
    forest fire control. Reflective remote sensing (~ 400–2500 nm) can increase the
    performance of agroecosystem modeling by providing canopy state variables at a
    spatial coverage and at spatial and temporal resolutions that would be impossible
    to achieve via ground observations or field campaigns (Dorigo et al. 2007). This
    supports management strategies that maximize crop production while minimizing
    environmental impacts. Global scale sensing At the global scale, the Global ERA5-HEAT
    (Human thErmAl comforT) represents state-of-the-art bioclimatology data record
    production. This dataset provides a complete historical reconstruction for a set
    of indices (Tmrt and UTCI) representing human thermal stress and discomfort in
    outdoor conditions since 01/01/1979 to near real-time. It is regularly extended
    as ERA5 data becomes available. Data is gridded with horizontal resolution 0.25° × 0.25°
    and has global coverage, except for Antarctica (90 N–60S, 180 W–180E) and provides
    hourly temporal resolution of data (Copernicus 2020). This dataset is computed
    using the ERA5 reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts
    (ECMWF). ERA5 combines model data with observations from across the world to provide
    a globally complete and consistent description of the Earth’s climate and its
    evolution in recent decades (Copernicus 2020). This dataset represents an important
    technological opportunity for assessing trends in human thermal comfort conditions
    as the past few decades have been marked by a changing climate. Furthermore, Copernicus
    forecasts UV index values, European air quality, and worldwide long-range transport
    of pollutants. RapidEye Satellite is another satellite system equipped with multi-spectral
    push broom sensors. It has the ability to acquire high-resolution data (5 million
    km2 per day). The satellite is radiometric, sensor, and geometrically corrected.
    It is also aligned to a cartographic map projection. This can remove distortions
    caused by terrain (RapidEye 2016). Another global scale sensing opportunity is
    the MethaneSAT satellite that will be launched in 2021 by the European Space Agency
    to continuously collect data on the magnitude and location of methane emissions
    around the planet. This will enable the identification of methane hotspots and
    monitoring of emission reductions over time (Krupp 2018). It will employ a highly
    sensitive spectrometer that measures light at the specific wavelengths where methane
    absorbs light within the shortwave infrared spectrum and detects differences in
    methane concentration as low as 2 parts per billion (ppb). MethaneSAT’s small
    pixel size (1–2 km2), and wide view path (200 km2) will be able to quantify small
    emission sources over large areas with finer resolution data that will allow larger
    emissions to be pinpointed to within 400 m of their source. This makes it preferable
    to the greenhouse gas satellite (GHG SAT) and is a key tool for the identification
    and reduction of methane emissions (Krupp 2018). Sensing parameters Environmental
    and meteorological sensing In surface measurements, there has been a systemic
    shift from human observation of weather elements to automated weather stations
    around the world (van der Meulen 2017). The meteorological parameters recorded
    include air temperature, precipitation, wind speed and direction, snow depth,
    soil temperature, solar radiation, visibility, cloud ceiling, and current weather
    (Leung and Gough 2016; Leung et al. 2020b). There are both positive benefits and
    negative impacts on the automation process of weather stations. Positive benefits
    include improved measurements at remote locations, higher frequency of observations
    (e.g., hourly precipitation amounts, gust speed), observations not reliant on
    personnel, reduction in human error, and real-time reporting (Sabatini 2017; van
    der Meulen 2017; Leung et al. 2020b). Negative impacts include reduced accuracy
    for some parameters (e.g., visibility, types of cloud, snow depth), inability
    to measure trace amounts of precipitation, false positives of snow depth due to
    weed growth underneath the sensor, lack of distinction between various types of
    precipitation (rainfall, freezing rain, hail, snowfall, etc.), power or transmission
    outages resulting in loss of data, and unclear impacts on long-term climate records
    due to a change in instrumentation (e.g., switching from a handheld thermometer
    to a digital thermometer) (Milewska and Hogg 2002; Follett et al. 2015; Sabatini
    2017; van der Meulen 2017; Leung et al. 2020a). These impacts could introduce
    non-climatic, artificial bias in the climate records, some of which can be addressed
    by the homogenization of the data (Squintu et al. 2019). Radiation is a decisive
    parameter in the study of outdoor thermal comfort (Brown and Gillespie 1995; Thorsson
    et al. 2007; Kántor et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014; Manavvi and Rajasekar 2020);
    however, it remains the most elusive element of the landscape (Brown and Gillespie
    1995). Measuring radiation in open spaces is complex owing to heterogeneous long
    and short-wave radiant flux densities, shading, and terrain. Radiation instruments
    can be classified based on the type of variable to be measured, field of view,
    spectral response, and intended use (WMO 2014). Instruments used for measuring
    radiation include pyranometers, pyro-heliometers, and sun-photometers. Net radiometers
    estimate net radiation; albedometers estimate the albedo of surfaces, while sun
    trackers measure global, diffuse, and direct irradiance. Pyranometers are characterized
    by the sensors used, specifically thermal sensors (thermopile) and photovoltaic
    (PV) sensors (Alados-Arboledas et al. 1995). Thermal sensors have a nearly constant
    spectral sensitivity for the whole solar spectral range and therefore enjoy wide
    application (Alados-Arboledas et al. 1995). Photovoltaic radiation sensors on
    the other hand are the simpler and cheaper alternative. Photodiode-based pyranometers
    have a response time of 10 μs making them suitable for measuring rapid changes
    in radiation. Using PV cells as radiation sensors has limitations. Firstly, there
    is a risk of limited and non-uniform spectral response of silicon cells. Secondly,
    the thermal dependence of these sensors (about 0.15% per °C) can cause a change
    in the sensitivity in mid-latitude regions (Michalsky et al. 1987). Also, it is
    crucial to note that most radiation sensors are not absolute and require calibration.
    The uncertainty of the radiation sensors depends upon resolution, changes in sensitivity
    due to environmental variables, deviation of spectral response, and time constant
    of the instrument (WMO 2014). Certain instruments perform better for particular
    climates, irradiances, and solar positions. Instruments for measuring radiation
    should be chosen carefully in accordance with their end-use and intended location
    of application (WMO 2014). Furthermore, procurement and deployment of these instruments
    under various conditions involve substantial costs thereby limiting concurrent
    measurements. Emerging technologies for measuring radiation have begun focusing
    on developing low-cost options (e.g., Martínez et al. 2009). Loveday et al. (2019)
    have developed iButton radiation sensors to measure albedo. This sensor comprises
    a silicon chip contained in a stainless steel can (17 mm in diameter and 6 mm
    high), which it uses as a communications interface (Loveday et al. 2019). Mean
    radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters
    governing human energy balance (Thorsson et al. 2007) and is among the parameters
    necessary in the calculation of the human thermophysiological stress indices,
    such as PET (Höppe 1999) and the UTCI (Bröde et al. 2012; Jendritzky et al. 2012).
    There are different technological solutions to acquire Tmrt data. Instrumentation
    to measure this data includes globe thermometers, pyranometers, and pyrogeometers.
    These instruments have enabled researchers to overcome the existing knowledge
    gap in the measurement accuracy of different radiation fluxes that influence human
    thermal exposure and thermal comfort outdoors. In addition to Tmrt, measurements
    of wind speed and surface and air temperature are important in the assessment
    of urban bioclimate and outdoor thermal comfort. Measurements of wind speed are
    often performed using a large variety of anemometers with the most common being
    the two-dimensional cup anemometer, followed by the heated sphere. On the contrary,
    the three-dimensional measurements of the wind speed are rare. Because wind speed
    is a critical variable in assessing the thermal comfort, accurate measurements
    are required to overcome limitations in certain instruments (e.g., cup anemometers
    are inappropriate at low wind speeds) (Johansson et al. 2014). For the measurement
    of air temperature, several aspects should be considered: (i) proper shielding
    of the sensor to minimize radiative exchange (ISO 7726 1998; WMO-No. 8 2008);
    (ii) proper ventilation of the radiation shield (WMO-No. 8 2008); and (iii) account
    for instrument thermal inertia (ISO 7726 1998; ASHRAE 2001) (Johansson et al.
    2014). For analysis of surface temperature, infrared thermography (e.g., portable
    infrared thermometer, thermal infrared imager, forward-looking infrared radiometer
    (FLIR)) (Scharf et al. 2008; Kuang et al. 2015) and remote sensing (e.g., LANDSAT-8,
    MODIS LST (Bechtel et al. 2019; Geletič et al. 2019) are used to provide temporal
    and spatial resolution for assessment of surface temperature changes. Passive
    air samplers collect pollutants over time. They are suitable for deployment using
    a variety of structures (e.g., trees, utility poles, traffic lights) in remote
    or urban locations. Since they capture pollutants passively by trapping them in
    a filter or orifice, they do not require electricity or labor to operate continuously.
    Passive air samplers can measure different pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic
    hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and gaseous mercury (Eng
    et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2019). Air pollutants can also be measured with active
    air samplers (Anderson and Gough 2020). Measurements can be undertaken for gaseous
    air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and carbon dioxide among others
    (Okeme et al. 2016; Anderson and Gough 2020). These measurement technologies are
    essential to biometeorological research on linkages between air pollution, urban
    development, and human health outcomes. Passive water samplers can measure heavy
    metals, flame retardants, antibiotics, and others (Brumbaugh et al. 2002; Chen
    et al. 2012; Cristale et al. 2013). Plants are an integral part of biometeorological
    studies. Studies pertaining to plants in biometeorology require data from various
    sources including meteorological parameters (e.g., air temperature, rainfall,
    relative humidity, wind speed and direction, leaf wetness, and solar radiation),
    physical parameters (e.g., CO2 concentration, soil structure), and biological
    parameters (e.g., observed symptoms, crop monitoring parameters) (Orlandini et
    al. 2009). Lysimeters are used to measure evapotranspiration of plants and come
    in types: weighable (percolation type) and non-weighable. Large-area percolation
    type lysimeters are used for water budget and evapotranspiration studies of mature
    and deep rooting vegetation cover (WMO 2014). On the other hand, basic lysimeters
    can be used in areas with bare soil or grass and are easy to install with low
    maintenance costs. Practical details that relate to the choice of the lysimeter
    wall material, depth of the lysimeter, and minimization of the soil and plant
    disturbance during extraction must be considered for application. Custom-made
    mini-lysimeters have been used in studies estimating the influence of trees and
    grass on outdoor thermal comfort in a hot-arid environment (Shashua-Bar et al.
    2011). Transpiration from trees can also be measured through the sap flow (i.e.,
    thermal dissipation method) (Gash and Granier 2007). The thermal dissipation probe
    (Granier 1985) is widely used to estimate tree transpiration. It is simple to
    build, easy to install, requires low-energy supply, and is relatively inexpensive
    (Pasqualotto et al. 2019). Further parameters such as chlorophyll and nitrogen
    can be measured through the use of spectral sensors (Peng et al. 1995; Ling et
    al. 2011). These sensors are lightweight, easy to use, and are handheld. They
    can be easily coupled with apps in a smartphone for enhanced use (Hariadi et al.
    2018). A limitation in the use of these sensors however is that they do not give
    value for the whole plant, requiring a computational average. In addition, they
    are costly and application varies based on the type of vegetation structure. Parameters
    such as leaf area index area crucial in plant studies. Leaf area index (LAI) can
    be measured through the leaf area meter (Pandey and Singh 2011; Dufrêne and Bréda
    1995; Marenco et al. 2009). Additionally, cost-effective photovoltaic leaf area
    meters have been developed (Igathinathane et al. 2008). Recent research has attempted
    to improve the leaf area index estimates by utilizing the gap fraction method
    (Martens et al. 1993; Phattaralerphong et al. 2006). The aforementioned method
    has been used widely for the ecophysiology of agricultural crops (Hicks and Lascano
    1995), boreal forests (Chen et al. 1997), and deciduous stands (Chianucci and
    Cutini 2013). Soil sensing is an important component of biometeorological research
    as it focuses upon the interactions between the human, animal, and plant populations
    across time scales. The synergistic relationship between soil, water, and climate
    regulates vegetation. Soil moisture has implications for agriculture, ecology,
    wildlife, and public health. After precipitation, it is the most important connection
    between the hydrological cycle and human, animal, and plant life (Lakshmi 2013).
    Soil moisture content as a function of depth is an important parameter for biometeorological
    research but its application varies. For example, evapotranspiration models generally
    pertain to a shallow depth (i.e., tens of centimeters) while agricultural applications
    require moisture information at root depth (i.e., order of a meter), while atmospheric
    general circulation models incorporate a number of layers down to a few meters
    (WMO 2014). Soil moisture is highly variable in both space and time; therefore,
    it can be difficult to measure soil moisture on the continental or global scale
    as needed by researchers (Lakshmi 2013). Space-based remote sensing of soil moisture
    is one method that provides surface soil moisture observations on a global scale.
    Researchers have developed various techniques for measuring soil moisture including
    thermo-gravimetric (Robinson et al. 2008; Hillel 2013), neutron scattering (Jayawardane
    et al. 1984; Fityus et al. 2011), soil resistivity (Amer et al. 1994), and dielectric
    techniques (Campbell 1990; Baumhardt et al. 2000; Hilhorst 2000; Schwartz et al.
    2008). Additionally, soil water potential measurements can be performed by several
    indirect methods using tensiometers, volumetric water sensors, resistance blocks,
    soil profiling probes, and soil psychrometers. Observations of soil moisture at
    a point scale are very sparse and observation networks are expensive to maintain
    (Lakshmi 2013). Soil moisture sensors are useful for studying processes at a smaller
    scale, but large numbers are required for a comprehensive understanding. Space-based
    remote sensing of soil moisture provides surface soil moisture observations on
    a global scale. For passive remote sensing of soil, four principal types of sensors
    are as follows: (i) optical remote sensing with a limited number of bands (e.g.,
    SPOT, ASTER, and LANDSAT); (ii) optical remote sensing based on hyperspectral
    sensors, particularly adapted for soil texture description; (iii) optical remote
    sensing with a thermal infrared band, adapted for soil temperature estimation;
    and (iv) passive microwave remote sensing adapted to soil moisture and vegetation
    estimation (Zribi et al. 2011). Soil temperature is another crucial parameter
    in soil studies. Thermocouples, resistance-temperature detectors (RTD), thermistors,
    integrated circuit sensors, and infrared thermometers are commonly used sensing
    tools for measuring soil temperature (Berard and Thurtell 1990). The challenges
    involved with soil temperature measurements include non-uniform temperature distribution,
    low resolution, self-heating effect, and shortened sensor life span (Aniley et
    al. 2017). A bent-stem soil thermometer is often used to measure soil temperature
    between the ground surface and a depth of 20 cm below ground (WMO 2008); however,
    such a thermometer is exposed to sunlight and needs to be removed in harsh conditions
    (Berard and Thurtell 1990; Aniley et al. 2017). Surface soil temperature can be
    measured using an infrared temperature sensor (Wang et al. 2015) or in situ sensors
    such as type E thermocouples and thermistors. Thermistors have several potential
    advantages such as higher temperature capability, high sensitivity, simple construction,
    and low cost (Aniley et al. 2017). Additionally, ultra-narrow field of view infrared
    radiometer sensors are being employed in terrestrial surface (e.g., soil, vegetation,
    water, snow) temperature measurements in energy balance studies. One challenge
    in using thermistors is that servicing and maintenance of buried instruments can
    disturb the soil and introduce noise to the data. The choice of a type of sensor
    depends on the equipment available, cost, application, and accuracy desired (Berard
    and Thurtell 1990). Physiological sensing Both human and animal studies in biometeorology
    use measurements of physiological parameters as health and performance indicators
    to examine how weather, climate, seasonality, and changes in the immediate environment
    affect health, productivity, and well-being. A body of literature examines how
    seasonal variations or environmental extremes (e.g., high or low ambient temperatures,
    high humidity, high altitude) affect heat stress levels, sleep patterns, and chronic
    or acute diseases (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008; Scharf et al. 2008; Schneider et
    al. 2008; Tsuzuki et al. 2008; Kanikowska et al. 2009). Other studies examine
    how specific interventions in patients’ daily routines can affect their recovery,
    for example baths with high CO2 concentrations, baths with high or low temperatures,
    negative air ions, and exposure to nature (Yamamoto and Hashimoto 2007; Iiyama
    et al. 2008; Suzuki et al. 2008). Typically, combinations of physiological variables
    are measured to assess subjects’ responses to environmental stressors. Tympanic,
    skin, sublingual or rectal temperatures, and sweat rates are common variables
    measured in humans and animals to evaluate heat stress and thermoregulation (Scharf
    et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2009; Mader et al. 2010; Wakabayashi et al. 2011). Temperature
    is measured with wearable or small portable devices such as thermistors, infrared
    and electronic thermometers, and sweat rates are measured with capacitance hygrometers.
    Heart rate, blood pressure, and blood flow help to assess body responses to various
    environmental stressors and are measured with wearable watches, tachometers, and
    sphygmomanometers for heart rate and blood pressure and laser Doppler flowmetry
    for blood flow (Iiyama et al. 2008; Suzuki et al. 2008). Blood samples are utilized
    in human and animal biometeorological studies to identify indicators of stress
    in the body chemistry with levels of cortisol and hematocrit being the most common
    (Antonelli and Donelli 2018; Pereira et al. 2008). However, there are a variety
    of measures tested depending on the study goals. Studies that examine sleep patterns
    and stress levels due to climate- or weather-related factors use cardiac output
    measured with portable or wearable ECG devices (Bhattacharyya et al. 2008; Delyukov
    et al. 2001). Other variables measured include sleep, brain and muscle activity,
    saliva and urine, oxygen levels, and respiration and expiration levels (Bhattacharyya
    et al. 2008; Celec et al. 2009; Taniguchi et al. 2011; Wakabayashi et al. 2011).
    Certain physiological parameters, such as skin temperature or heart rate, can
    be easily measured with wearable or portable devices, while obtaining others require
    lab tests and controlled settings. The complexity of the experiment and the type
    of equipment used will affect the data accuracy, sample size, and replicability.
    Developments in non-invasive techniques and wearable devices for obtaining physiological
    measurements can help to overcome some of these limitations. In addition, opportunities
    to collect physiological data from ubiquitous wearable devices such as smart watches,
    present a promising new direction in research on human and animal biometeorology.
    Lack of standardization for studies in semi-controlled experiments is an ongoing
    concern. The frequency and time of measurements, minimal amount of data points,
    number of participants, and duration of the experiments vary widely between the
    studies making it difficult to draw comparisons among regions and populations
    (Johansson et al. 2014). Selection and use of instruments are guided by the international
    standards and national guidelines, such as ISO 7726 (2001) and ASHRAE Handbook
    of Fundamentals (ASHRAE 2001). These standards specify the required and desired
    accuracy and response time. However, some of the guidelines might be difficult
    to follow in the field experiments. For instance, for thermal comfort studies,
    it is recommended to position the thermal sensor at 1.1 m, which is a core of
    a standing person (ISO 7726 2001); but in reality, sensors are often placed at
    above 2 m height for long-term data collection to avoid obstruction of pathways
    and prevent vandalism. Instruments have to be selected in accordance with appropriate
    standards and regularly calibrated to maintain specified accuracy. In addition,
    instruments need to be properly positioned, shielded, and ventilated to avoid
    under- or over-estimation. For instance, air temperature and humidity probes should
    be protected from direct sun exposure (Johansson et al. 2014). Sensors located
    close to roads or air-conditioned buildings can be affected by waste heat or escaped
    cool air. Response time is another important concern for decisions on quantity
    and time interval of measurements. For instance, quick response time and larger
    time interval are necessary for wind measurements to ensure accuracy and capture
    of low and high winds. Three directional wind measurements are ideal for optimal
    accuracy; cup and propeller anemometers are not effective for areas with low wind
    speed (Johansson et al. 2014). Globe radiation measurements are affected by the
    size and color of the globe (Teitelbaum et al. 2020). Smaller black globes commonly
    used in Kestrel Heat Stress Trackers tend to overestimate globe temperature in
    the sun due to the globe overheating (Kántor and Unger 2011; Middel et al. 2016).
    Additionally, smaller globe size is more affected by the wind variations and can
    lead to inaccuracies on globe temperature measurement (Johansson et al. 2018).
    The flat gray color of the globe better represents characteristics of human clothing
    and skin, while black-colored globes tend to overestimate the influence of short-wave
    radiation (Thorsson et al. 2007). Considerations for individual environmental
    exposure wearable devices include convenience for participants, safety, participants’
    anticipated behaviors, and sensor placement. Sensors need to be worn outside of
    bags and clothing to avoid contact with skin or sweat. Consistent placement among
    participants is important to ensure comparability (Kuras et al. 2017). Accurate
    measurement of body temperature in uncontrolled or semi-controlled environments
    remains a challenge. Rectal temperature is the most accurate method to measure
    core temperature, but it is not suitable for outside the lab environment. Telemetric
    pills are one possible alternative. Some of the accuracy concerns are that the
    exact position of the pill in the intestinal tract cannot be controlled; therefore,
    differences in position between subjects can affect the temperature (Dougherty
    et al. 2009). In addition, the telemetric pill is affected by the ingestion of
    cold and hot fluids (Dias and Paulo Silva Cunha 2018). Sensing approaches Wireless
    sensor networks and the internet of things Many sensing technologies can be enhanced
    through the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to overcome the challenges
    of analogue sensors mainly long time queues for data acquisition, processing,
    and analysis. The WSNs refer to spatially distributed sensors that monitor specific
    information (e.g., air quality, weather) and cooperatively convey the data to
    a central base station (i.e., sink) using wireless connectivity (Matin and Islam
    2012; Flammini and Sisinni 2014). For example, WSNs have proved to be effective
    in real-time communication of environmental and meteorological data across vast
    areas (Yahya 2020). The WSNs as shown in Fig. 3 are composed of “nodes” and a
    base station or gateway, which enables acquisition and transmission of field observations
    to a data storage and processing facility, and further enables end users to utilize
    the field observations or derived products from devices and for diverse applications
    (Flammini and Sisinni 2014; Kocakulak and Butun 2017). Some of these observations
    utilizing WSN include marine environment monitoring (Xu et al. 2019b), monitoring
    and controlling greenhouse environmental conditions (Ferentinos et al. 2017),
    and forecasting apple disease (Nabi et al. 2020). The “Internet of Things” (IoT)
    is defined as any object that is aware of the context of its location with the
    capacity to communicate through the internet, at any time and location. Advances
    in the use of the IoT as a platform for WSN has rapidly progressed and increased
    the usefulness of near real-time data for understanding the effect of rapid environmental
    change (Chapman 2015). Application of IoT sensor networks for near real-time data
    acquisition overcomes the shortcomings of traditional analogue techniques that
    are prone to vandalism, drift, and have long time queues for data processing.
    Fig. 3 The IoT end-to-end pathway of data transmission (illustration based on
    Kocakulak and Butun 2017) Full size image Configuration of IoT-WSN varies with
    respect to data requirements, range of communications, energy consumption, licensing
    restrictions, and setup costs. These limitations can impact the application of
    collected data through observation frequency, number of monitoring stations, and
    anonymization of data. The long range-wide-area network (LoRaWAN) is a type of
    low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) that permits sensor nodes to communicate over
    long distances using radio networking technologies (Khutsoane et al. 2017; Mdhaffar
    et al. 2017). LoRaWAN removes the requirement for conventional networking connectivity,
    such as WiFi, SIM cards, or Ethernet cables, thus reducing the hardware and operating
    costs of dense sensor networks. The data is transferred to the internet via a
    gateway, and the network can be used as an “Open Network” through organizations
    such as “The Things Network” that enable citizen science (Khutsoane et al. 2017;
    Mdhaffar et al. 2017) or to provide timely weather information to rural farmers
    in developing countries (Reda et al. 2018). Although IoT-WSN is being increasingly
    operationalized for military, industrial, and smart city use, its scope of application
    is still limited within biometeorology. Moreover, future efforts aimed at enhancing
    the use of IoT technologies for biometeorology ought to address concerns of low
    sensor accuracy and the need for standardization of data collection and analytics.
    Crowdsourcing Chapman et al. (2017) and Meier et al. (2017) define crowdsourcing
    based on Muller et al. (2015) as the collection of atmospheric data from public
    sensors that are connected to the internet. Zhu et al. (2019) delineated four
    different types of potential providers of crowdsourced data namely (1) smart embedded
    sensors, (2) social networks, (3) sensors provided by meteorological services,
    and (4) citizen-based science. People are not only message receivers but also
    perceive and produce weather and environmental information through social media
    (Zhu et al. 2019). For example, social media channels were used by extracting
    keywords or hashtags used in posts to evaluate severe weather events or rare atmospheric
    phenomenon in central Canada and the United States (Leung et al. 2017). In Europe,
    forest fires are also monitored through blogs, tweets, and photos (De Longueville
    et al. 2010). The inclusion of subjective data such as opinions, reactions, emotions,
    and feedback on the weather can inform emergency management and disaster planning
    (Zhu et al. 2019). Crowdsourcing initiatives can also enable sensing of climate
    change impacts on plants and animals, and indirectly on humans. Two Dutch citizen
    science projects to monitor ticks collected nearly 50,000 geo-located tick bite
    reports from 2006 to 2016 (Garcia-Marti et al. 2018). Crowdsourced information
    can support mapping of hazards, risks, and potential exposure. Particularly in
    cities with high spatial variability, there is a need for high spatial resolution
    spatial weather and climate data. Using crowdsourced data from citizen weather
    stations such as Netatmo in combination with high-quality meteorological data
    is an effective way to overcome the challenges presented by those heterogeneous
    urban environments. This heterogeneity includes microclimates and variability
    in temperature, precipitation, air quality, and wind speeds (Chapman 2015). These
    high-spatial-resolution technologies can contribute to increasing urban resilience
    through improved accuracy of predictions leading to enhanced monitoring capabilities,
    and emergency preparedness. Crowdsourced weather stations are used globally in
    the analysis of spatial variability in near-surface air temperature (Chapman et
    al. 2017; Leibovici et al. 2017). The benefits of crowdsourced data include widespread
    coverage, low cost of instrumentation, and real-time data collection. For example,
    Netatmo and Wunderground stations have been installed in highly urbanized areas
    which makes the dataset suitable to analyze variability between various urban
    microclimate conditions. Other aspects, such as the cooling effect of urban parks
    cannot be analyzed directly from the data, as stations are almost exclusively
    installed in built-up environments (Meier et al. 2017). The basic Netatmo and
    Wunderground weather station packages, measure air temperature, humidity, pressure,
    noise level, and carbon dioxide concentrations. Advanced modules also include
    other parameters such as precipitation and wind. Weather station operators can
    decide if they wish to publish their datasets, which can be freely accessed by
    the public, however, little metadata is available for individual stations (Chapman
    et al. 2017). These sensors have been used in human biometeorological research
    across various European cities (Chapman et al. 2017; Meier et al. 2017; Fenner
    et al. 2017; de Vos et al. 2017; Nipen et al. 2020; Feichtinger et al. 2017).  The
    crucial deficit in crowdsourced data is the unknown data quality. These data need
    to be quality controlled to account for inconsistent metadata, low data availability,
    poorly maintained/calibrated instruments, and placement of modules (e.g., exposure
    to direct solar radiation). Several studies have developed post-processing methods
    to control the data quality of Netatmo networks (Meier et al. 2017; Chapman et
    al. 2017; Napoly et al. 2018; Nipen et al. 2020). Additionally, Meier et al. (2017)
    evaluated the accuracy using comparative measurements in a climate chamber and
    in the field. They confirmed the average accuracy level of ± 0.3 K but revealed
    that temperature offsets of up to 1.3 K occurred frequently and that four of the
    seven tested sensors showed a warm bias of nearly 0.5 K. It is also important
    to keep in mind that if the instruments are not carefully maintained and calibrated,
    this could lead to a possible drift toward poorer data quality over time (Meier
    et al. 2017). Furthermore, there is an element of uncertainty with respect to
    the continuity of sampling and duration from these crowdsourced devices and networks.
    These ad hoc devices and networks are typically not intended for long-term data
    collection compared to conventional weather stations (Jean 1991). Conventional
    weather stations have the advantage of having long time series, more stable funding,
    regular maintenance, and operational standards as set out by the WMO (Jean 1991).
    This allows data to be exchanged globally and used in meteorological forecasting
    and research models. These ad hoc devices and networks can supplement data collection
    undertaken by conventional networks. Discussion Accuracy, guidelines, and standardization
    Acquiring spatially and temporally congruent information on how weather and climate
    influence human, animal, and plant health can present challenges; however, it
    is crucial to understand the limitations of current, new, and emerging technologies.
    For example, a heated tipping bucket rain gauge is suitable for tropical climate
    or summer field season on a local to regional scale but may not be suitable for
    snow studies due to the evaporation loss from the heating component in the gauge
    (Savina et al. 2012). The use of different technological solutions or their combination
    (e.g., sensing and modeling) should facilitate this task providing the most significant
    weather data for human, animal, and plant health, such as radiation, wind, temperature,
    and humidity (Leung et al. 2020b). Detailed weather and climate datasets should
    be linked with biophysical indicators and psychological responses (Oke et al.
    2017). For example, outdoor thermal comfort indices and human outdoor thermal
    comfort models have been developed to study the link between weather and psychological
    parameters such as ambient stressors, physical exertion, outdoor human comfort,
    and pre-existing health conditions (Epstein and Moran 2006). Review studies by
    Johansson et al. (2014) and Potchter et al. (2018) found a great variety of instruments
    (with diverse accuracy) and methods (without standardization) used to measure
    meteorological variables and access outdoor human thermal perception. The use
    of numerous methods makes it difficult to compare results from various studies
    and accordingly there is a need for standardization and guidance regarding how
    to conduct field measurements and surveys in outdoor environments. These standards
    and guidelines should provide advice regarding the choice of measurement sites,
    type and accuracy of sensors (especially for Tmrt and wind speed), statistical
    methods, and unifying outdoor thermal comfort questionnaires. Furthermore, evaluating
    the human comfort indoor and outdoor is challenging due to a large number of physiological
    variables (e.g., thermoregulation, energy balance (Chen and Ng 2012), sweat rate,
    metabolic response (Lenzholzer and de Vries 2020), physiological adaptation or
    acclimatization (Hondula et al. 2015), in addition to environmental and psychological
    variables, that influence thermal, visual, and aural comfort (Jayathissa et al.
    2020)). The acquisition of physiological data as an indicator of human perception
    is complex, particularly in real-world settings where perception is influenced
    by various factors (Bell et al. 2001), such as changes in the environment or in
    the field-of-view of the investigated person (Ojha et al. 2019). Accordingly,
    personal exposure should be combined with information about various physiological
    susceptibility factors (Kuras et al. 2017). The present study supports the previous
    conclusions regarding the urgent need for standardization of methods and techniques
    in contemporary biometeorological research, by accounting for different temporal
    and spatial scales across diverse climates and regions. Access to technological
    advancements Gaps in technology present another challenge. Technology is linked
    to economic development. The type and scale of technology used in biometeorology
    are dependent upon the circumstances, capacity, and resources of the interested
    researcher (Kesici Çalkan 2015; Steenhuis and de Bruijn 2012). While global scale
    satellite data is accessible, access to higher resolution data is dependent on
    available resources. In addition, the lack of infrastructure (e.g., electricity
    and data coverage) in remote areas and isolated communities also limits the use
    of certain technologies. Power may be unreliable or intermittent and data transmission
    can be slow and expensive in less built-up areas. Technologies such as automated
    weather stations or other instruments that require constant electrical access
    and frequent data transmission to operate can create barriers to widespread adoption
    and dissemination. While existing technologies enable data production at high
    spatial and temporal resolutions, there is a significant challenge in materializing
    all its potential—the so-called digital divide. Originally, this concept was conceived
    to distinguish between people with and without physical access to Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICTs), but since its introduction, it has evolved
    to include other aspects such as the technical capacity to utilize them (Longo
    et al. 2017). In this regard, the differences between the global north and south
    regarding access to economic resources and training might limit researchers in
    developing countries to the usage of old technologies. As such, the potential
    benefits of newer technologies remain a privilege for researchers in developed
    countries. Populations of the digitally invisible especially in low and middle-income
    countries (LMIC) countries are characterized by lack of access to and quality
    of technology, poor infrastructure, inadequate computer and digital skills, and
    language barriers (George 2020). They lack smartphones, credit cards, and internet
    connectivity, in addition to living beneath the concentration of sensors and data
    capture points (Longo et al. 2017). This digital divide is caused by inequality
    in the ability to use technology, access to social support networks, and quality
    of available technology (Diaz Andrade and Techatassanasoontorn 2020). Other research
    challenges include the availability of funding, access to expertise in data collection
    and processing, and technical skills training. Vendors for biometeorological instruments
    and engineers for their installation, calibration, repairs, and maintenance are
    difficult to access in most low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Similarly,
    training and re-training of experts on how to interpret instructions for the use
    of instruments is a required standard for data collection in meteorology for professional
    competence, particularly with the invention of new instruments. This standard
    is lagging in most LMIC because of funding. Together they have an influence on
    the data quality from these regions. Barriers to the adoption of new biometeorological
    technologies can be reduced for countries with capacity challenges through membership
    in global research networks and collaborative research partnerships. Free-for-research
    platforms can also provide a mechanism to overcome the digital divide between
    the global north and south. For example, free satellite images can be downloaded
    from Planet (Kirschbaum et al. 2019), processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to
    map agricultural land in southern Mali or the loss in green and gray spaces areas
    in urban cities (Clinton et al. 2015; Aguilar et al. 2018). Satellite images that
    are provided by GEE are ideal datasets and biometeorological assessments of agricultural
    fields at the local scale. For example, Rapid Eye Satellite was used in the village
    of Bourasso in rural Burkina Faso to investigate child malnutrition by linking
    satellite images with individual fields to reveal crop yield estimation of family
    garden plots (Sorgho et al. 2017). The scarcity, randomness, and inaccessibility
    of in situ continuous climate data and the estimation of global air temperature
    in various parts of the world have been solved with the emergence of satellite
    data (Sobrino et al. 2020). Access to personal data Access to individual-level
    data has become more prevalent in health-based research through wearable devices
    such as smart watches, skin tattoos, or smartphones. Biometric and geo-referenced
    data are two kinds of collected data from such technologies that can be useful
    in biometeorological research but have the potential to be personally invasive.
    For example, researchers need to obtain informed consent from participants for
    any studies involving human subjects. Participants must be provided with an opportunity
    to accept, decline, or withdraw from the study (Crow et al. 2006). Besides, there
    is a need to restrict the access of collected data, particularly if it is attributable
    to the user (Miller 2008). Social media posts are useful in tracking biometeorological
    data; however, scraping/crawling social media posts and tweets may violate the
    service provider’s terms and conditions for using their websites. For example,
    Section 4 of Twitter’s terms and conditions states that “scraping the services
    without the prior consent of Twitter is expressly prohibited” (Twitter 2020).
    Similarly, other data sources may also impose restrictions on the use of their
    data, such as prohibiting commercial use. In addition, digital data solely based
    on those wearable devices or smartphones may be biased and only offer a partial
    picture of the reality of the digital invisible—those people that do not own such
    devices or are less connected for different reasons such as poor bandwidth, age,
    neglect, or underrepresentation (Longo et al. 2017). Data collection and storage
    Most new sensors offer wireless and near real-time data collection and storage.
    The basic steps for data transmission include the following:(1) data collection
    using data loggers or communication hardware; (2) data management with network
    servers, data quality checks (quality assurance/quality control; QA/QC), pre-processing
    data, and archive data repository; (3) data display using visualizations, near
    real-time displays, graphs, maps on websites or files for download; and (4) data
    usages for the end users who can be researchers, the general public or stakeholders
    (Muller et al. 2013). Siting and placement of sensors and measurement technologies
    are crucial for quality data collection. Guidelines and standards rarely exist
    for new and emerging technologies, such as the WMO guidelines for conventional
    meteorological equipment. Clean and clear metadata is essential for the analysis
    of collected data and research transparency (Muller et al. 2013). This is a limitation
    of many urban climate studies (Stewart 2011). In this respect, citizen science–based
    data has the potential to fill gaps in knowledge and to optimize sensor network
    configuration. Data visualization Visualization is an important part of workflow.
    Typical tasks include the analysis of the data and the communication of collected
    information to different audiences (Rautenhaus et al. 2018). With increased data
    size and underlying complexity, creating effective visualization becomes more
    challenging. Machine learning and data mining methods can bring complex datasets
    to higher abstraction levels so that they can be more easily interpreted (Wu et
    al. 2020). Rautenhaus et al. (2018) summarized historical and current visualization
    strategies for weather forecasting and meteorological research. Nocke et al. (2015)
    reviewed state-of-the-art climate network visualization and existing tools. Typical
    visualization of static results of climate networks included time series, global
    maps, scatter plots, or line plots (Nocke et al. 2015). Using interactive visualization,
    the power of the human visual system, and the strengths of computer-based data
    analysis can be exploited further (Nocke et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2020). In this
    regard, visual analytics offers an extensive body of knowledge about visualization
    and interaction techniques that could be adopted in biometeorological research.
    This can enable the user to find additional value in the data set. Challenges
    regarding frequent usage of interactive visualization lie in the time dependency,
    uncertainty in data attributes, and filtering settings. Time dependency adds an
    additional dimension to the data that often needs to be loaded separately, which
    can hinder the exploration of temporal trends in large data. Another challenge
    in interactive visualization is the uncertainty of data structure and its attributes.
    In addition, filtering settings may render the results arbitrary since they are
    usually not derived from quantitative criteria (Nocke et al. 2015). Virtual reality
    can offer some advantages for biometeorology. Caluya and Santos (2019) for example
    developed a virtual reality tool utilizing a 360° camera to train weather observers
    based on previous human observation examples. Cross-cutting and integrated scientific
    approaches The impacts of climate change on society are cross-cutting and integrated
    scientific approaches are needed to address the multi-faceted challenges presented
    by climate change and extreme weather. Scientific studies often investigate a
    single parameter (or variable) and do not examine a problem in its entirety. Many
    research programs face resource challenges where budgets may be cut or reduced.
    This necessitates building synergies across disciplines to maximize the usage
    of existing personnel and infrastructure (Gruntfest 2018). Integration across
    disciplinary silos can change the approaches used to solve scientific problems
    rather than letting technology or disciplinary specializations determine and drive
    which problems are addressed (Whitesides 2014). Open Science (including open hardware
    and software) is a prerequisite for cross-silo integration and it can support
    a more equitable, inclusive, and accessible knowledge commons and infrastructure
    (Traynor and Foster 2017). Complex digital solutions fed by IoT connected sensors
    and complemented by crowdsourced data help to merge this gap, by providing a means
    to merge interdisciplinary information in a single analysis and/or visualization
    platform. Digital twin cities are examples of such endeavors but the concept of
    digital twin itself can be applied for any scale and subject. Biometeorological
    research is interdisciplinary by its very nature. Advancements in measurement
    and sensing technologies enable researchers from different backgrounds to work
    across disciplines and address the shared challenges posed by climate change and
    extreme weather events. Conclusions Advancements in sensing technologies provide
    a plethora of meteorological and biological data across scales. Innovations in
    information and communication technologies have also led to dramatic improvements
    in the dissemination of data across jurisdictions and disciplines. Such unprecedented
    growth provides a unique opportunity to advance biometeorological research, especially
    in relation to studies that analyze how weather and our changing climate influence
    the health of humans, animals, and plants. Understanding the opportunities and
    limitations presented by current and emerging sensing technologies is foundational
    for the advancement of biometeorological research and a more sustainable and healthy
    future. Data availability Not applicable. References Abubakar GA, Wang K, Shahtahamssebi

    Abstract:

    Ecosystems monitoring is essential to properly understand their development

    and the effects of events, both climatological and anthropological in nature.
    The amount

    of data used in these assessments is increasing at very high rates. This is due
    to increasing

    availability of sensing systems and the development of new techniques to analyze
    sensor

    data. The Enviro-Net Project encompasses several of such sensor system deployments
    across

    ﬁve countries in the Americas. These deployments use a few different ground-based
    sensor

    systems, installed at different heights monitoring the conditions in tropical
    dry forests over

    long periods of time. This paper presents our experience in deploying and maintaining
    these

    systems, retrieving and pre-processing the data, and describes the Web portal
    developed to

    help with data management, visualization and analysis.

    Keywords: micro-climate monitoring; phenology monitoring; sensor networks; Web-based

    sensor data management

    Introduction

    Monitoring ecosystems at high spatial and temporal resolutions still is a challenging
    endeavor.

    Satellite-embarked sensors that offer regular passes support only coarse resolution
    monitoring and

    on-demand high resolution satellite or airborne-based monitoring are still too
    expensive to be considered

    viable options for frequent data collections.

    Furthermore, validation of satellite and airborne

    Sensors 2011, 11

    measurements against the values observed at ground level is often difﬁcult to
    obtain. Ground-based,

    or in-situ, sensor systems for environmental monitoring have associated challenges
    as well [1], but have

    undergone a considerable evolution recently. Such systems are now capable of collecting
    data at very

    high temporal resolution for very speciﬁc ecosystems through long periods of time.
    In particular, the use

    of wireless sensor systems has been shown to be very effective in this type of
    monitoring [2], from the

    cost perspective and increasingly in terms of performance and reliability as well.

    There are many challenges associated with high resolution (both spatial and temporal)
    in-situ

    environmental monitoring, many of which already well recognized in the literature.
    Rundel et al. [1], for

    instance, discuss how these networks generate more data than can be managed by
    traditional methods for

    ﬁeld research data, with data quality assurance and control surpassing capabilities
    of single individuals

    dealing with the data, but still being required to produce high-quality data.
    The large variety of problems

    impacting quality can be more easily detected by using adequate cyberinfratructure
    for automating the

    detection, which also allows more timely identiﬁcation of problems in the deployments
    themselves. They

    also argue that, although data storage and retrieval is reasonably easy to attain,
    publishing and sharing

    data is not as straightforward. Still according to the authors, one of the advantages
    of this integrated

    approach for offering data from multiple sensors is the larger world view generated,
    which is not possible

    with single sensors—at least not at these spatio-temporal scales. The authors
    also acknowledge the

    importance of training scientists in using in-situ monitoring tools, the ﬂexibility
    of power requirements

    for these systems (especially wireless) and the use of energy harvesting, problems
    related gaps in the

    data (from numerous causes), difﬁculty to assess precision and ﬁdelity in such
    systems, and the value of

    commercial availability for decreasing costs and scaling up deployments sizes.

    Hart and Martinez [3] discuss power management,

    large volumes of data and required

    cyberinfrastructure, beginning of commercial efforts, and data quality control
    as important issues

    concerning in-situ environmental monitoring.

    They also raise additional points that require more

    work, such as assessment of environmental conditions any equipment needs to withstand
    them

    (e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration); standardization requirements related
    to data and metadata

    representation; security requirements, preventing tampering with both equipment
    and datasets within

    the data management systems; and, better means for data interpretation (e.g.,
    by using new methods

    for data mining). Another relevant effort can be found in the report from Estrin
    et al. [4], who focus

    on cyberinfrastructure. Key points include: the need for better prototyping and
    design of end-to-end

    test-beds to allow validation across wide ranges of environments, applications
    and domains; creation

    of better services regarding time synchronization, in-situ calibration, and adaptive
    duty cycling, among

    others; seamless use of high performance computing facilities for data processing;
    tools to improve

    support for metadata; and, collaboration efforts as a basis for training new scientists
    (from multiple

    domains) and as a mechanism for sustaining long term deployments.

    This paper distills our experience in deploying and managing in-situ sensor systems
    within the

    Enviro-Net Project (http://www.enviro-net.info/). Currently, Enviro-Net includes
    39 deployments spread

    throughout nine sites in six different countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa
    Rica, Mexico and

    Panama), and is coordinated at the University of Alberta, in cooperation with
    local partner research

    teams at each site.

    The initial goal of the deployments was to monitor vegetation phenology, the

    study of climate effects on periodic biological activity [5], correlating it with
    environmental variables,

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6456

    such as availability of light, air temperature, etc. These and other variables
    are monitored by different

    types of sensing systems, with the collected data being transmitted back to Internet
    servers in Alberta

    either through a commercial satellite up-link or being manually retrieved from
    the data loggers and

    then sent via email, FTP or Enviro-Net’s website.

    The following gives but one example of the

    applicability and usefulness of such type of systems. From the data collected
    by a combination of

    two types of specialized solar radiation ﬂuxes sensors, it is possible to derive
    different vegetation

    indexes, which can be used as proxies to monitoring phenological responses. In
    order to distinguish

    vegetation distribution, particularly from perspectives such as species distribution
    or successional stage,

    the areas to be monitored are numerous and relatively small. Similarly, short
    term effects of isolated

    climatic phenomena (e.g., a rainstorm or sharp changes in temperature) require
    higher rates of data

    acquisition. These characteristics require higher spatial and temporal resolutions
    only achieved through

    in-situ monitoring of each ecosystem.

    In this context, detailed discussions of how we dealt with these challenges within
    the Enviro-Net

    Project form the main contributions of this paper, particularly considering the
    scenario under which the

    project was developed. The monitored sites are mostly tropical dry forests in
    remote locations, which

    are challenging environments for both equipment performance and personnel’s ability
    to work. Also, all

    deployments are based on inexpensive and commercially available technology, essential
    characteristics

    to allow scalability and reproducibility of experiments. The heterogeneity of
    equipment from different

    manufacturers also introduce difﬁculties, mainly regarding systems maintenance.
    Having long term

    (multiple-year) deployments impose extra management requirements. Integrated data
    management, a

    fourth aspect, presents numerous challenges ranging from data quality control
    to user interface usability.

    Finally, and maybe the most relevant aspect, is the issue of high spatial and
    temporal resolutions,

    considered not only within a single deployment, but also among different deployments
    both in the

    same and different sites.

    Part of these challenges have simple individual solutions, however, from

    a more holistic perspective, the integration of the solutions for all of them
    is what actually enables

    the use of sensors systems for in-situ environmental monitoring. After a review
    of related work on

    Section 2, this paper describes our solutions regarding deployments of in-situ
    monitoring systems in

    Section 3, pre-processing and treatment of data in Section 4 and data publication
    and accessibility using

    a Web-based system in Section 5.

    Related Work

    This section divides related work discussion into applications (covering the motivation
    for in-situ

    monitoring), deployments (showing experiences in installing and maintaining sensor
    systems), and data

    management (comparing different efforts in dealing with the large amounts of sensor
    data generated).

    2.1.

    Applications

    Environmental monitoring is one of the driving forces behind the adoption of ground-based
    sensing

    systems, pushing the need for higher spatial and temporal resolution. Examples
    of efforts in this direction

    include: (i) the creation of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    [6], which aims at

    studying climate change, land-use change and invasive species on a continental
    scale using, among

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6457

    other methods and technologies, ground-based deployments of sensor systems; (ii)
    FLUXNET [7],

    which use micrometeorological and ﬂux towers to measure exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor,

    and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. These initiatives
    heavily rely on long

    term ground-based monitoring solutions. FLUXNET has a public data management framework
    called

    Fluxdata.org [8], which also offers ﬂexible metadata support. However, due to
    the diversity of equipment

    and protocols for deployment and data pre-processing, data integration within
    the Fluxdata.org system is

    limited, mostly offering access to data on the original format provided by the
    data producers. This limits

    the possibilities of applying ﬁlters and aggregation operations to the data or
    generating derived data

    products within the system. Although our system also deals with a variety of equipment,
    the deployment

    protocols are largely uniform, and pre-processing protocols are developed using
    a centralized approach,

    which allow us to achieve a considerable level of data integration within Enviro-Net.

    These and other initiatives, aiming at integration of ground-based monitoring
    efforts, are

    leading to an evolution from single site environmental monitoring into networks
    for environment

    observation [3].

    This evolution culminates with the current vision for a Sensor Web [9–11],

    encompassing several types of deployments of sensor systems, interconnecting them
    globally

    through a Web-based integration strategy using standards developed by the Sensor
    Web Enablement

    (http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sensorweb) Working Group of the
    Open Geospatial

    Consortium, Inc. (OGC) (http://www.opengeospatial.org/).

    A small clariﬁcation on the deﬁnition for (wireless) sensor networks may be in
    order. Mainly within

    Computing Science (CS) research [12,13] and in earlier Sensor Web related efforts
    [9], this deﬁnition is

    narrower than what is used in this paper. In this more restrictive deﬁnition,
    a (wireless) sensor network is

    based on nodes (also known as “motes”) that have sensing, data storage/processing,
    and communication

    components plus a power source. These nodes are usually autonomous and operate
    cooperatively—by

    communicating amongst themselves—to collect and process data, also being programmable,
    i.e., able

    to behave differently according to, for instance, the type of application, power
    supply conditions,

    environmental conditions, etc. Although we have used this type of wireless nodes
    in our deployments,

    we do not require the capability of offering communication amongst network’s components.
    Instead, we

    adopt the centralized type of processing architecture as classiﬁed by [12], being
    more in line with the

    current Sensor Web approach to networks [11]. It is sufﬁcient for us, for instance,
    that the connection of

    sensing elements be done at the level of integrated data products.

    Applications of in-situ monitoring systems are also the topic of other research
    efforts.

    Porter et al. [2] present a good review of the capabilities of wireless sensor
    networks (WSN) to be

    applied within the ecological domain. Hamilton et al. [14], while covering capabilities
    of networks

    of sensors applied to ecology as well, also highlight the idea of ecological observatories,
    adopted

    within NEON. An extensive review of in-situ monitoring efforts is presented by
    Rundel et al. [1],

    classiﬁed according to their area of focus: above ground, under-ground, and aquatic
    environments.

    Porter et al. [15] discuss the state of the sensing technology, what can already
    be accomplished and

    a few areas that require more development (e.g., data management software and
    new types of sensors).

    Precision agriculture is a particularly relevant application area for pervasive
    sensing technology. For

    instance, Lee et al.

    [16] evaluate monitoring applied to specialty crop, while Matese et al.

    [17]

    use wireless sensor network in vineyard monitoring, and Aquino-Santos et al.

    [18] evaluate data

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6458

    transmission protocols in small scale deployments in watermelon ﬁelds.

    In this paper, we discuss

    aspects that apply to many of these scenarios, particularly if considering them
    in a long term monitoring

    perspective. However, our focus is on practical and logistics aspects of deploying
    and maintaining

    equipment, retrieving and managing the data, and supporting analysis of data products.

    2.2.

    Deployments

    Other research groups have discussed their efforts with ground-based deployments
    of sensor systems,

    mostly focusing on the use of wireless equipment. A pioneering effort in applying
    wireless sensor

    networks was the habitat monitoring experiment in the Great Duck Island [19] in
    the coast of

    Maine in the United States, deployed to offer a less intrusive way to study behavior
    and nesting

    of seabird colonies.

    The SensorScope project [20,21] is another example, taking place mainly in

    Switzerland. They have described their experience with developing the hardware
    and software for their

    wireless system, performing tests, and going on deployment expeditions, along
    with their architecture

    and communication protocols.

    With a focus on solar energy availability, AdaptSens [22] adopts

    system-wide levels of operation to cope with different amounts of available energy.

    GreenOrbs

    (http://www.greenorbs.org/) [23] is a long term effort for monitoring an university
    campus urban forest

    close to Hangzhou in China, using a large number of nodes. LUSTER [24] is a system
    for monitoring

    ecological variables that implements fault-tolerant distributed storage over a
    delay-tolerant network using

    an hierarchical architecture; the system also covers user interaction both in
    the ﬁeld expeditions and a

    web interface for data retrieval. Another effort [25], aiming at monitoring the
    UNESCO World Heritage

    site Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, China, implemented a low power wireless monitoring
    system inside

    the site’s caves with a tailored long distance connection to transmit the data
    back to an on-line server.

    Another World Heritage site, a rainforest ecosystem in Queensland, Australia,
    was monitored by a

    wireless sensor network project [26], which served as a prototype for future long
    term deployments

    using similar conﬁgurations. Another interesting application, monitoring the activities
    of volcanoes in

    Ecuador [27,28], entails addressing issues such as higher sampling rates (100
    Hz or more), need

    for higher accuracy and more expensive sensors.

    Changing the spatial scale a little, monitoring a

    single redwood tree [29] in California in the United States, offered new insight
    in understanding

    the microclimate surrounding this type of tree.

    Reports on deployment experiences also focus on

    the diversity of problems faced when using wireless sensing equipment, such as
    the LOFAR-agro

    project [30] that experienced problems ranging from hardware failures to network
    protocols errors and

    software problems. While deployment related efforts in our work focus on issues
    related to managing

    the life cycle of ground-based sensor data, other works [31,32] bring evaluations
    of technology for

    wireless sensor network equipment, including communication protocols, power consumption
    and data

    transmission issues.

    To the best of our knowledge, none of the deployment efforts reviewed here address
    the same

    scenario as ours: having (multi-year) long term deployments, based on cooperative
    efforts of several

    (heterogeneous) teams, using commercially available equipment from multiple manufacturers,
    with an

    integrated effort of data retrieval, quality control and data availability through
    an easy to use Web-based

    platform. We believe this is a more realistic scenario for ground-based environmental
    monitoring efforts.

    The current efforts within the Life Under Your Feet project (http://lifeunderyourfeet.org/)
    [33] are the

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6459

    closest to our own, also having long term, spatially distributed deployments with
    a Web-based data

    visualization interface integrated with geolocation information. However, they
    do not seem to deal with

    heterogeneous equipment and data formats, nor offer ﬁltering/aggregation options,
    derived datasets or

    quality information in their data management solution.

    2.3.

    Data Management

    Many of the challenges related to sensor data management have been known for a
    while [4].

    However, several technical and non-technical questions still remain unaddressed.
    Broad scope projects

    for management of earth observation data try to present a top-down approach to
    data management.

    One such project is DataOne (http://www.dataone.org/), an effort towards distributed
    cyberinfrastructure

    for Earth observation data, bringing together a multitude of data providers and
    consumers. Another

    effort is our partner project GeoChronos (http://www.geochronos.org/), which implements
    means for

    sharing (and interacting with) tools, datasets and libraries of records within
    the Earth observation domain.

    Enviro-Net, however, uses more of a bottom-up approach, offering specialized solutions
    for the types of

    data supported, expanding these types as needed. This allows data management solutions
    that are geared

    towards speciﬁc needs to answer speciﬁc science questions.

    Although it is common to think about sensor data management as stream data management,
    with

    the associated challenges (on-line aggregation, classiﬁcation, etc.) [34], at
    least within environmental

    research, particularly in ground-based monitoring, this is not a frequent scenario.
    Most of the current

    applications based on sensor data use the perspective of historical (or an archive
    of) time series

    data. Applications using the stream data perspective are only beginning to appear,
    and the current

    applications that do require that perspective—e.g., volcano monitoring [27]—are
    still the exception.

    Data manipulation for most of the current applications is done after having the
    data collected and stored,

    applying a variety of analytical operations in an ofﬂine fashion [8,35].

    Middleware software for automating control of deployments is also the focus of
    current research

    efforts, in form of architectures for integrating different network deployments
    [36], or Web-based

    interfaces for interaction with and control of wireless deployments [37]. Our
    focus, on the other hand, is

    on managing the data products rather than controlling the equipment from within
    our system.

    The data archival aspect of data management involves not only storage of data,
    but also retrieval,

    documentation, access control, among other issues. Furthermore, data curation
    of long-term repositories

    involves not only handling the data but also helping scientists answering research
    questions and also

    maintaining the underlying computational infrastructure [38]. Within Enviro-Net,
    although we are only

    beginning to to devise our long term plans for infrastructure maintenance, our
    system already offers data

    access with a number of ﬂexibility aspects to foster efﬁcient use of the data.
    Efforts on applying digital

    library practices in support of sensor data management are also gaining acceptance
    [39]. Issues of data

    quality and integrity, as well as the elements of data collection that affect
    them, need to be an integral

    part of such efforts [40], particularly from the perspective of making data documentation
    available

    along with the datasets. In this scenario, metadata becomes as valuable as the
    datasets themselves,

    from quality metadata about deployments [41], to offering search and annotation
    options and enriching

    visualization [42]. Finally, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow data
    to be accessed in a

    programmatic way, which can be achieved, for instance, using Web services interfaces
    (using Sensor

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6460

    Web Enablement standards) or using specialized solutions such as a wrapper-based
    middlewares [43]

    or REST-based APIs [44].

    Data quality aspects are an integral part of Enviro-Net, and are being

    improved, particularly regarding documentation and metadata coverage. Although
    data ingestion is

    largely automated and data access is possible through the Web user interface within
    Enviro-Net, data

    access using a programmatic interface is still under development.

    3.

    Sensor Systems Deployments

    Apart from a few test installations, all of our deployments are intended to be
    long term, collecting

    data for a minimum of two to three years. The earliest deployments were installed
    in mid 2007, with

    the ﬁrst wireless deployments installed in mid 2008. All deployments suffered
    from interruption in data

    collection on some scale, usually from a few days up to a couple of months, depending
    on how early the

    problem was detected. Earlier deployments suffered 100% failure rate due to equipment
    design being

    incompatible with tropical environments. Many problems were related to unexpected
    interactions of

    environmental conditions with the equipment. However, most of the deployments
    are still operational

    today, with secured funding for maintaining them operational until at least 2013.

    Currently, Enviro-Net has 39 permanent deployments, plus temporary deployments
    in Edmonton,

    Canada for equipment testing and calibration. The Biosphere Reserve of Chamela-Cuixmala
    in the state

    of Jalisco, Mexico has a tower (overlooking the top of the canopy) and a wireless
    understory sensor

    system. The number of nodes in a wireless deployment is usually 12, but there
    are deployments with as

    few as ﬁve and as many as 20 nodes, each node having between three to six sensors
    each. The Santa Rosa

    National Park in Costa Rica hosts two more towers. The Parque Natural Metropolitano
    in Panama has

    the most recent deployment with 24 thermocouples monitoring leaf temperatures.
    In Brazil, three sites

    have deployments: the Mata Seca State Park, the Serra do Cip´o National Park,
    and the Environmental

    Protection Area of the Pandeiros River, all located in the Minas Gerais state.
    The Mata Seca park

    hosts ﬁve towers and eight understory deployments (including four wireless deployments),
    all in the

    cerrado ecosystem, which is similar to a savanna; three understory deployments
    are active close to the

    Pandeiros river, also a cerrado ecosystem; and, Serra do Cip´o park has ﬁve towers
    plus seven understory

    deployments, two of which using wireless systems, covering natural grasslands
    and forest vegetation

    in the cerrado. Finally, three deployments are operational in the province of
    San Luis in Argentina,

    a phenology tower monitoring a grassland ecosystem, and one tower and one wireless
    understory

    deployment installed in a adjacent chaco ecosystem. Two more wireless towers are
    operational chaco

    and grassland ecosystems in the province of C´ordoba, Argentina. Three more deployments
    are expected

    to start data collection in 2011 in the province of San Luis. Although the ideal
    spatial scales for many

    applications requires higher numbers of nodes deployed to be considered high spatial
    density—more in

    line with our plans for future sensor networks—the intermediary step with 5–20
    nodes per deployment

    was necessary to prove this kind of scale is feasible in remote locations with
    long term deployments.

    These are, however, dense enough to characterize many ecosystem level behavior
    (such as response to

    climatic events), and even differences between neighboring ecosystems. The experience
    acquired in

    these smaller deployments, which is the fundamental contribution of this text,
    serves as a basis for these

    larger scales expeditions.

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6461

    The main challenge of having deployments across an entire continent is without
    question maintaining

    them. Partnerships with research groups based closer to the deployment sites proved
    essential, with

    the added issue of offering training to the people performing basic maintenance.
    The small amounts of

    time available for training leads to the choice of equipment that is simple to
    use and maintain. Hands on

    experience has proven to be the most efﬁcient method to train new users, specially
    when focusing on how

    to deal with common problems. Special attention needs to be given to data retrieval
    and manipulation

    methods in order to allow tracking of data problems later in the processing chain.
    Documentation of

    our own group’s deployment protocols and data handling procedures complemented
    and helped with

    equipment manuals and speciﬁcations.

    Regularity in systems maintenance is key in keeping them running within long term
    deployments. Life

    expectancy and calibration deviation for sensors are usually a parameter speciﬁed
    by the manufacturer.

    Enviro-Net deployments usually have two maintenance cycles: one for basic overall
    system check (and

    data retrieval for off-line deployments) and another for complete veriﬁcation
    of the equipment. The

    basic cycle has intervals ranging from two weeks to two months, depending on the
    accessibility of the

    site and regularity of visits for other purposes. This task is usually performed
    by a member of the local

    research teams and involves cleaning the sensors if needed—mostly from dust build-up
    or obstructions

    such as leaves, insect or bird nests, etc–veriﬁcation of the general health of
    the system, and data retrieval,

    usually the most relevant part in a basic maintenance cycle. The complete cycle
    intervals ranges from 6 to

    12 months, and allows detection of a broader range of problems—e.g., battery charge
    retention capacity.

    This task is usually performed with one more experienced technician.

    3.1.

    Sensors and Loggers

    Tables 1 and 2 list the equipment used in our deployments. For datalogger systems,
    shown in Table 1,

    wired and wireless systems are available. In wired systems all the sensors are
    connected directly to

    the data logger and the communications with it are done mostly through a physical
    connection using a

    cable (serial or USB, for instance) to connect to a laptop. For wired deployments,
    we mostly used Onset

    Computer Corp. (http://www.onsetcomp.com/) data loggers; speciﬁcally the HOBO
    Micro Station, the

    HOBO U12 Series and the HOBO U30 Series models were employed.

    Wireless systems, on the other hand offer different strategies to eliminate the
    need for cabled

    connections. As an example, the equipment manufactured by Olsonet Communications
    Corporation

    (http://www.olsonet.com/) offers two types of nodes: a collector and an aggregator.
    The former is

    connected to the sensors and is responsible for wirelessly transmitting the readings
    to the aggregator,

    which works as a centralization point for the data collection also dubbing as
    a short term data logger.

    The aggregator, however, requires a cable connection for setup or data recovery.
    A different strategy is

    used by the equipment manufactured by MicroStrain, Inc. (http://www.microstrain.com/),
    where each

    ENV-Link

    TM node works as an individual data logger, but the connection to these nodes
    for setup and data

    retrieval is done through a wireless connection.

    The storage capacity for samples in both types of loggers usually match the power
    consumption

    characteristics to achieve similar longevity in ﬁeld deployments. As discussed
    later in this section a

    satellite up-link and a continuous battery recharging capability (e.g., using
    solar panels), would allow

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6462

    even longer time spans. However, since in practice maintenance is necessary long
    before these limits are

    reached, battery and storage lifetimes are not a limitation for most of these
    types of equipment.

    The biggest advantage of wired equipment is reliability, being in use longer,
    and tested under many

    combinations of conditions. Besides limited spatial coverage, when compared to
    wireless systems, the

    most problematic aspect of this technology is accessibility. Everything requiring
    a physical connection

    between the logger and the laptop with the control software, having to climb up
    a tower to perform tasks

    as routine as retrieving data is a somewhat serious limitation. Even using longer
    cables for the sensors,

    which still have a limited maximum length on account attenuation of the electric
    signal, towers for higher

    canopies require climbing to access the logger.

    For environmental monitoring, the major advantage of wireless sensor systems is
    the possibility of

    covering larger areas, without giving up high spatial and temporal resolution,
    and at a reasonably low

    cost. One low point of the technology is that it is still fairly new as a commercial
    product, and still

    needs some adaptation. Errors in communication protocols, radio range limitations,
    power management

    related issues, lack of features in the control software packages, and breaches
    in weather prooﬁng cases

    weight in at the cons for wireless systems. However, our experience shows the
    technology has already

    reached the tipping point to becoming viable for use in long term, harsh environment
    deployments.

    Commercial availability of wireless sensor networks (WSN), as a technology, is
    still limited.

    Although the original ideas for WSN—i.e., large number of general purpose nodes
    distributed

    in very dense deployments, randomly placed, almost weightless, and disposable—have
    yet to

    materialize [20,28,45], wireless technology used in conjunction with sensory equipment
    is proving to

    be invaluable in monitoring larger areas at the scale of a single ecosystem.

    Table 2 lists the main sensors use in our deployments, which are are well known,
    commercially

    available, inexpensive, and based on established technologies. With the variables
    listed, it is possible to

    extract plenty of derived information from them, such as vegetation indexes and
    light absorption patterns

    for photosynthesis. In our deployments, we used solar radiation sensors provided
    by Onset and Apogee

    Instruments, Inc. (http://www.apogeeinstruments.com/); air temperature and relative
    humidity sensors

    by Sensirion Inc. (http://www.sensirion.com/) and Onset (The Onset temperature
    and relative humidity

    sensors used are repackaged Sensirion sensors); and, soil moisture sensors by
    Decagon Devices, Inc.

    (http://www.decagon.com/) Lower cost sensors systems usually do not offer calibration
    options for the

    user; they have their calibration adjusted at the manufacturer (who usually offer
    recalibration services).

    3.2.

    Deployment Conﬁgurations

    Within the Enviro-Net Project there are currently two main types of deployments:
    phenology

    towers and understory installations. A phenology tower uses two solar radiation
    ﬂux sensors (also

    called pyranometers), measuring wavelengths between approximately 300 to 1,100
    nm, and two

    Photosynthetically Active Radiation ﬂux sensors (or PAR sensors), which measure
    wavelengths between

    approximately 400 to 700 nm. Ratios of these measurements can be used to derive
    vegetation indexes

    such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or Enhanced Vegetation Index
    (EVI)–see, for

    instance [46–49]. Such indexes can be used as proxies to monitor vegetation phenology.
    Understory

    deployments are used to monitor the conditions below the canopy level, and usually
    cover a larger area.

    Figure 1 shows the schematics of a phenology tower on the left, with two PAR sensors
    and two

    pyranometers, one of each measuring incoming solar radiation and one of each measuring
    reﬂected solar

    radiation. The right side of the ﬁgure is a photo of one phenology tower installed
    in Brazil, which raises

    the sensors eight meters from the ground, six meters above the canopy.

    Figure 1. Phenology tower schematics (left) and a tower in Brazil (right).

    Most radiation ﬂux sensors have view angles of up to 85◦ from zenith (when oriented
    up, i.e.,

    measuring incoming radiation) or nadir (when oriented down), with a uniform 360◦
    rotation. With

    that, the radius that affects the readings is up to around ten times the distance
    (h) between the sensor

    position and the surface being monitored (i.e., radius = tan(85◦) × h). For our
    deployment, we usually

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6464

    have at least ﬁve meters between the top of the canopy and the sensor measuring
    the reﬂected radiation

    (8 to 15 m in total), leading to a coverage radius of at least 50 m in the monitored
    area.

    Obstructions within the range of a sensor interfere with the reading and might
    not be easy to identify

    from the data only—e.g., higher canopy of adjacent ecosystems or a nearby tower
    with other instruments

    may interfere with sensor measuring incoming radiation. A sensor measuring radiation
    reﬂected from the

    canopy is more susceptible to interference—e.g., the positioning of solar panels,
    whose reﬂectiveness

    greatly affect readings. Large panels should be positioned outside of the interference
    radius, while

    smaller panels can be positioned at the same height as the sensor for no interference.
    Note that it is

    difﬁcult to position radiation sensors and solar panels at different orientations,
    since both should use the

    optimal exposure angle to the sun, roughly North, in southern latitudes, or South,
    in northern latitudes.

    Monitoring the conditions under the canopy level, i.e., understory deployments,
    allows assessing a

    different range of micro-climatic conditions and also soil condition—e.g., temperature
    and moisture

    levels. Understory deployments are usually easier to access, and with that, they
    are useful for validating

    the readings observed in a tower and also as a backup for certain variables in
    case of sensor malfunction

    in a tower. Using wireless systems substantially increases the spatial coverage
    of understory deployments

    with a fraction of the increase in cost and efforts to retrieve data and maintain
    the system.

    Figure 2 depicts an example of such a wireless deployment on its left side. On
    the right side, it shows

    a node deployed in the chaco ecosystem in Argentina. The height at which the sensors
    are installed in

    this case is also determined by the canopy’s height, usually ranging from right
    on the ground (e.g., for

    grasslands) to 1.5 m for taller canopies. One example of application that relies
    on the spatial coverage

    and resolution of understory wireless deployments is deriving Leaf Area Index
    (LAI)—see [48,50], for

    instance. LAI, along with Plant (PAI) and Wood (WAI) Area Indexes [51], are important
    indicators

    of vegetation productivity, being also used as a reference for crop growth rates.
    Combining readings

    from a phenology tower with understory readings of absorbed solar radiation ﬂuxes,
    it is possible to

    derive NDVI for the location of each node. Using NDVI and knowing an appropriate
    conversion factor,

    characteristic to each ecosystem, it is possible to calculate LAI for each node
    [48]. This allows the

    creation of maps of very high spatial and temporal resolutions for both NDVI and
    LAI.

    Figure 2. Understory schematics (left) and a node in Argentina (right).

    Having the option of deploying a large number of sensors in a given area also
    raises the question of

    how to distribute these sensors. We have adopted three different strategies to
    spatially distribute nodes

    and their sensors. Figure 3 illustrates these strategies. The ﬁrst approach, shown
    in the left, is intended

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6465

    to monitor a linear region along a transect. This is particularly useful for monitoring
    transitions between

    ecosystems or exposition to different conditions within the same ecosystem. The
    center of the ﬁgure

    shows distribution of nodes in concentric circles, which is sometimes called a
    “star” deployment. This

    type of deployment is used mostly to monitor conditions around a point of interest,
    usually corresponding

    to the footprint of phenology or carbon ﬂux towers, allowing combination of measurements
    from both

    deployments. A third strategy is to deploy nodes in a grid, covering a potentially
    larger area of interest.

    Regularly spaced grids are useful for uniform monitoring throughout an area.

    However, irregular

    grids can also be useful when special conditions occur within a region of interest.
    Examples include

    part of an area that is also being monitored by other experiments (e.g., leaf
    collection for chlorophyll

    measurements); or patches affected by ﬁre and monitoring their recovery is of
    interest.

    Deploying Sensors Systems

    From a logistics perspective, installing tower and understory systems have fairly
    different

    characteristics. Phenology towers reached up to 15 m in one of our deployments,
    with 9 m being the

    most common height. Selecting the location for installing a tower that high must
    take into account the

    representativeness of the ecosystem, the impact of building it, and the accessibility
    to bring its parts to

    the site. Another important issue is the uniformity in the height of the canopy.
    Too much variation in the

    tree heights will lead to scaling problems in the data, an area with taller vegetation
    will be contributing

    signiﬁcantly less to the readings. When installing a phenology tower intended
    to be used in a long term

    data collection, the growth of the vegetation should also be taken into account.
    Younger ecosystems

    might grow considerably at intervals as short as one year, forcing height upgrades
    to a tower.

    The height of the canopy is also a concern for understory deployments. Ecosystems
    with lower

    canopies, such as grasslands, require that solar radiation ﬂux sensors be positioned
    almost adjacent to

    the ground, while taller canopies allow sensors in a higher position (0.60 to
    0.10 m are common heights).

    For wireless deployments, the node is usually installed in a higher position to
    improve radio signal range,

    while the sensors are deployed at the appropriate heights.

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6466

    Although it might seem like a trivial task at ﬁrst, correctly positioning the
    sensors should take into

    consideration a number of factors. One issue is the creation of unnatural sources
    of shade (e.g., from

    the pole where the node sits) into the sensor. For deployments in the northern
    (southern) hemisphere,

    positioning radiation ﬂux sensors South (North) of obstructions avoids this issue.
    Air temperature and

    relative humidity sensors are also affected by their positioning. Besides being
    hosted at solar radiation

    shields and being positioned as to allow for air circulation, they should also
    keep some distance from

    radiation absorbing materials. Most of the weatherprooﬁng cases, for instance,
    absorb non-negligible

    quantities of solar radiation. We had cases of temperature deviations of up to
    20 ◦C because of a dark

    weatherproof case.

    One crucial aspect to sensor systems deployments in tropical ecosystems is the
    exposure to constantly

    high relative humidity. Values between 90%–100% are common in these environments.
    Combined

    with high temperatures, this condition transformed many weatherproof casings into
    humidity traps. The

    main problem was actually the difference of internal and external pressure in
    the cases. That made

    previously air tight cases absorb humidity while balancing the pressure, exposing
    the internal circuits

    and connectors. Both for loggers and sensors, even cases designed and tested to
    work underwater were

    susceptible to this problem. Adopting pressure relief valves signiﬁcantly attenuated
    the problem, even

    though sometimes they can get clogged with dirt and stop working. Another adopted
    practice that also

    helped reduce this problem was to use silicone-based adhesives to seal borders
    and openings, around

    sensor cables and also around the sensors themselves.

    For wireless sensor systems, testing the range of the radio system at the actual
    deployment site is

    essential. Vegetation distribution and terrain contours are difﬁcult to predict
    beforehand and have a

    signiﬁcant impact in the radio range. Two major aspects have shown to be of particular
    relevance

    when conducting this kind of test. Firstly, if the type of batteries used decrease
    the voltage offered

    to the system with time, the tests should not be conducted with new batteries.
    A more accurate test

    of radio range is achieved using more realistic battery levels—e.g., levels of
    battery similar to when a

    deployment running for more than half of the expected battery life. In case of
    rechargeable batteries, the

    charge level used should be the average level the batteries would have when going
    without charge for

    the maximum foreseeable period. For tropical dry forests the maximum period without
    non-negligible

    sun light exposure for charging batteries through solar panels is around two days.
    It is worth of note

    that regular alkaline (zinc and manganese dioxide) batteries, widely adopted to
    power nodes in sensor

    networks, do change their voltages depending on their level of charge.

    The second aspect interfering with radio range is related to the vegetation density,
    particularly to

    changes in density throughout the seasons. Radio range is greatly affected by
    branches and leaves

    in the line of sight of the signal. Ranges of up to 300 m in a level and open
    ﬁeld can be reduced

    to as little as 15 m (a factor of 20 reduction) simply by having a somewhat closed
    vegetation. In

    particular, radio frequencies at 2.4 GHz are severely attenuated by trees and
    leafs. This frequency is

    adopted by several wireless sensor systems, including the ZigBee Alliance (http://www.zigbee.org/)

    communications protocols (based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Personal Area Network
    standard),

    widely used in these systems. Furthermore, it is very usual for deployment campaigns
    to take place

    in the dry season, when rainfall is less of a concern for the schedule in deployment
    plans. However,

    foliage of deciduous vegetation can be at much lower levels than it will be in
    the wet season, which

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6467

    can signiﬁcantly affect the range of radio signal. There is no deﬁnite solution
    to address the vegetation

    changes, since simulating the conditions of a different season is difﬁcult. Monitoring
    the overall network

    health, which can be done in its simplest form by detecting gaps in the data,
    and repositioning nodes

    when necessary has been the best measure to address this issue in new ecosystems.
    These, in turn, serve

    as a reference for future deployments in similar ecosystems.

    Seasonal change also can have an unexpected impact in the visibility of nodes
    and sensors. When

    installing sensors in the dry season, there are few obstructions and less color
    variability on the landscape.

    This makes visibility reasonably good.

    However, areas that signiﬁcantly change their vegetation

    coverage or areas that have dense vegetation can become quite challenging from
    the point of view of

    visibility in the wet season. Using colorful markers—red or yellow ribbons or
    paint are effective for

    this—can save a lot of time when trying to ﬁnd nodes and sensor that have been
    deployed for a while.

    Not relying solely on the GPS to locate small pieces of equipment such as individual
    nodes and sensors

    can be the difference between returning to base camp before or after sunset. One
    aspect of using such

    markers that was not taken into account in this work is the increased attractiveness
    color makers might

    exert on animals (particularly insects).

    3.4.

    Retrieving Data

    Data from ground-based sensor systems can be retrieved either in-situ or remotely.

    The former

    involves expeditions to the deployment sites, which can be very expensive. However,
    if the site is

    already being visited in a regular basis for other reasons (collecting leaf samples,
    for instance), this

    might become more feasible. Most of our current deployments are working in this
    scenario. This has

    proven to be quite an advantage from the perspective of maintenance of untested
    systems, allowing early

    detection of problems with equipment. With equipment proven to work well, using
    a remote solution is

    probably more cost and time effective.

    Collecting data remotely might be achieved in a number of ways. One possibility
    is using a dedicated

    long range wireless communication system—e.g., by using a WiFi connection with
    repeaters—to

    transmit data at regular intervals to a computer installed in a location with
    permanent power supply.

    If there is also Internet connectivity, the data can be forwarded to on-line permanent
    archival systems.

    This alternative usually has a signiﬁcant overhead of maintaining the local computer
    and the long range

    communications system running.

    Another alternative is to use cellular networks with data capabilities. Although
    cellular coverage is

    not good in more remote areas, some regions have enough connectivity to allow
    data transmission in

    a fairly regular fashion. Using higher gain antennas improves signal reception,
    but the system must be

    prepared to go through reasonably long periods with no connectivity, preserving
    all data for delayed

    transmission. Since an actual Internet connection is provided with a cellular
    connection, the data can be

    transmitted directly to on-line archival servers.

    A third type of remote data retrieval solution involves using a satellite up-link.
    This approach is also

    subject to communications failure (e.g., if there is too much cloud coverage).
    The connectivity provided

    here usually is not to the Internet, but connectivity to a service provider that
    receive the data from the

    satellite. This provider in turn makes the data accessible, often offering automated
    ways of retrieving

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6468

    the data from their on-line servers. In our case, systems that have proven to
    work consistently well have

    been equipped with a satellite transmitter.

    Remote connectivity allows not only automated data retrieval, but also some level
    remote operation of

    the equipment. Options of stopping and starting the logger, setting sampling and
    storage rates are often

    available. In a few cases, it might be interesting to be able to set other parameters
    remotely, particularly

    with wireless systems. Research projects have explored conﬁguring deployments
    remotely [37], even

    reprogramming loggers and collection nodes in some cases [20,36]. This level of
    ﬂexibility in remote

    deployment conﬁguration, however, is not yet commercially available.

    4.

    Data Pre-Processing and Cleaning

    When considering the volume of data generated by current sensor systems, automation
    of

    data management related tasks within a proper computational infrastructure is
    of paramount

    importance [1,3,4,10,33,52]. However, actual datasets generated by sensor systems
    might present a

    variety of problems and exceptions, which are often difﬁcult to foresee. This
    is a severe drawback in

    attempts to automate the ﬁrst data management phase: ingestion of data into any
    computational data

    management system. This sort of problems are often dismissed as being “implementation
    details”,

    but their implications can actually affect data quality parameters and models
    to store and distribute

    the data. In higher end (expensive) and/or homogeneous equipment this sort of
    problems are usually

    easier to tackle. However, in a setting like ours, using equipment from different
    manufactures, in a

    highly distributed effort, with an aim at low limits for equipment and maintenance
    costs, these issues are

    fairly commonplace.

    The implementation of solutions for problems with raw datasets are usually carried
    out within

    a data pre-processing (or data cleaning) phase.

    Although these terms usually encompass

    explicit data quality veriﬁcation or removal of erroneous readings (e.g., values
    outside the scale

    measured by a sensor), this section only considers problems that actually prevent
    (or are difﬁcult

    to trace after) the ingestion of the data into a data management system.

    When compared

    to classiﬁcation scales usually adopted in describing Earth observation data products,
    after the

    corrections in this section, the dataset should treated as “raw” data, or, as
    being at Data

    Processing Level 2 in the National Research Council (NRC) Committee on Data Management

    and Computation (CODMAC) [53] classiﬁcation,

    or to Data Processing Level 0 used by

    NASA (http://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-processing-levels-for-eosdis-data-

    products/). The next paragraph discuss the problems we had to handle when preparing
    our datasets.

    4.1.

    Synchronization

    Keeping correct temporal information for timestamping readings from distributed
    sensors can be

    really challenging, not to mention correcting time deviations after recording
    the data [54].

    Time

    synchronization is an issue both at single deployment, with multiple collectors
    and/or loggers, and across

    deployments. Within a deployment, hardware imprecision and heterogeneous initial
    synchronization

    methods are the two main causes of synchronization problems. Time keeping in electronic
    equipment

    is based on crystal oscillators, which can deviate from their standard frequency
    with environmental

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6469

    conditions, especially temperature. This causes the time measurements to deviate
    as well, and affects

    almost all types of data logging equipments. In this case, the error is proportional
    to the sampling rate,

    which for applications such as seismology, with high sampling rates are, these
    errors are quite signiﬁcant.

    For long term environmental monitoring, this can also be a problem. One solution
    is to have an accurate

    reference time keeping and a mechanism to keep the synchronicity among loggers.
    Possible solutions

    include having more precise equipment kept at a less exposed location or using
    GPS time as references.

    A few wireless communication protocols have time synchronization features embedded
    within their

    message exchanging mechanism [55].

    When dynamic time synchronization against a reliable reference is not feasible,
    the initial

    synchronization method is the basis for all time information within a deployment.
    This is the most

    common scenario for our current deployments, with the usual mechanism for synchronization
    being

    based on the time information from the computer with the control software used
    to start a deployment.

    Therefore, the time information in that computer should be synchronized (e.g.,
    by using Network Time

    Protocol, IETF RFC 5905 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905)).

    Data comparison from different deployments at small temporal resolutions must
    take into account

    potential synchronization errors. However, since sampling rates are commonly higher
    than desired

    temporal resolution, most data analysis is done with aggregated data instead of
    the entire dataset, which

    attenuates the effects of the time synchronization related errors, particularly
    when looking at hourly or

    even daily averages.

    Similar to other reports [54], we also experienced power source related synchronization
    problems.

    Time measurement in some logging equipments can be affected by power outages or
    low voltages from

    the power source. Some types of equipment use the main power to keep time measurement
    running

    and, although time measurement usually requires very little power, if the supply
    is interrupted, the

    equipment’s clock gets reset.

    Current data logging equipment and control software offer poor support to address
    time

    synchronization problems. Many of them don’t even let the user see what is the
    current time in logging

    system to manually check for time drifts. But this is evolving in control software
    for wireless systems,

    since these suffer more noticeably from time related problems.

    4.2.

    Time Zones

    When dealing with deployments that are geographically distributed throughout various
    timezones,

    establishing the correct local time can become an issue. Once again, relying on
    a computer’s time as a

    reference to timestamp the readings is a major cause of errors. Different versions
    of operating systems

    have different levels of automation regarding time zones and daylight saving time
    conﬁgurations, often

    allowing users to change these manually. Therefore, besides having the correct
    time on the computer, as

    already discussed, wrong conﬁgurations of time zone and changing conﬁgurations
    for daylight saving

    times can also lead to inconsistencies such as: having data for a single deployment
    timestamped

    with different daylight saving times, or difﬁculties determining which is the
    correct local time when

    comparing data for deployments in different time zones.

    For our deployments, when issuing ﬁeld laptops, time conﬁgurations always adopt
    the local standard

    time for the site, disabling automatic changes to daylight saving time. However,
    even rugged ﬁeld

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6470

    laptops fail, and temporary misconﬁgured replacements can be used. Or, an even
    less elaborate problem,

    which happens often, new users get confused by seemingly “wrong” time settings
    and change the time

    conﬁgurations.

    It is possible, however, to check time zone and daylight saving times against
    sun time. This is done by

    comparing several days of sunrise time from data collected by solar radiation
    sensors to expected sunrise

    times for the location. This method is not accurate enough for correcting for
    hardware time drift, for

    instance, but is good enough to correct for one or more hours shift in the timestamps.
    This veriﬁcation

    is performed on all of our datasets before ingesting them into our data management
    system.

    4.3.

    Data Format Variation

    One burdensome problem of dealing with data from different types of equipment
    is handling changing

    data formats or a variety of possible formatting errors.

    The ﬁrst of such types of problems to be addressed are changes in the data format
    made by

    the equipment manufacturer. A considerable amount of format changes from manufacturers
    are not

    documented adequately with new versions or software updates. Unfortunately, this
    type of problem

    needs to be addressed case-by-case.

    One problem that was surprising to us is that some types of failures in the sensors
    themselves can

    generate errors in the data format by, for instance, changing the number of data
    columns in a record. As

    an example, this could make a record that should have three data columns (e.g.,
    readings on temperature,

    humidity and solar radiation) actually have extra or missing columns. Similar
    effects can be caused by

    connector designed to be generic and support different sensors: a sensor behaving
    in some unexpected

    way may cause the data collection node or the logger to perform incorrect conversions
    or even generate

    software errors that will affect the data format. In wireless equipment, we have
    also seen the data

    format being drastically changed by problems in the transmission of the data.
    In the presence of radio

    interference, usually created by the operation of higher powered wireless equipment
    in proximity of the

    deployment, the data transmission gets compromised, generating errors in both
    the values of the readings

    and the structure of a record.

    All these types of errors can cause failures in the ingestion software or, worse,
    have errors introduced

    in the data ingestion process without any warnings. Our solution to this was to
    make ingestion software

    monitor for format changes and generate informative error messages, allowing identifying
    problems

    before ingestion.

    4.4.

    Provenance

    Given the tailored nature of data pre-processing steps described in this section,
    it is difﬁcult to

    keep standardized provenance information and even harder to automate collection
    of this type of

    information, as also made evident in [40].

    In our current data management solution, simple free

    text description ﬁelds are used to keep track of pre-processing steps and choices.
    Nonetheless, with

    a ﬂexible metadata speciﬁcation tool, such as the one created for our partner
    project GeoChronos

    (http://www.geochronos.org/) [56], it would be possible to add speciﬁc ﬁelds to
    document evolving

    aspects of the pre-processing steps.

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6471

    Although difﬁcult to obtain and maintain, documentation of the pre-processing
    steps are important to

    identify not only errors in the pre-processing itself, but also problems with
    the deployments. For instance,

    the appearance of too many erroneous records from a wireless data collection node
    are potential evidence

    of problems with the sensors, the sensor connections, the node hardware or radio
    interference sources in

    the surroundings. The latter problem might even indicate affected readings from
    other nodes that would

    otherwise go unnoticed.

    5.

    Web-Based Data Analysis

    A resourceful and easy to use data management system is the last piece of our
    solution for large

    scale in-situ monitoring. The pre-processing step presented in the previous section
    allows the data to

    be ingested into the system, being stored in an integrated representation. Then
    users can interact with

    the system having access to data ﬁltering, aggregation and other more specialized
    processing operations.

    Data visualization and retrieval are offered for data at all processing levels
    after pre-processing, providing

    a ﬂexible mechanism for analyzing the data within the system or using other tools
    with the data already

    narrowed down to the parts of interest. This section discusses these issues, also
    considering data quality

    and user interaction aspects.

    5.1.

    Uploading Data

    The task of data ingestion can be automated for datasets that require pre-processing
    steps known

    beforehand.

    Automated data ingestion methods are particularly useful with deployments that
    have

    automated data retrieval, as is the case for data retrieval using a satellite
    up-link and an the respective

    Internet service for getting the data.

    However, new datasets or datasets that needed specialized

    pre-processing before getting ready to be ingested need a ﬂexible mechanism to
    map available data to the

    integrated representation of the data in the system. Properly handling errors
    and exceptions in the data

    ingestion processing is necessary from both user experience and data quality perspectives.
    Automated

    data ingestion needs timely error generation so the user responsible for the deployment
    is kept informed

    and and can take corrective action. Informative descriptions of errors helps the
    user identify and diagnose

    the error causes, which is particularly important for manual ingestion of data
    that was pre-processed in

    any non-standard way.

    Another aspect to be considered is the documentation of the process for every
    dataset upload.

    Metadata regarding date and time, data source, user, pre-processing options, among
    others, help identify

    sources of error such as faulty time related correction or application of outdated
    pre-processing methods.

    Most of these metadata can be collected automatically by the system, which unburdens
    the user and

    prevents missing information from less thorough users.

    Only with an integrated data representation model it is possible to offer a common
    user interface,

    types of ﬁlters, aggregation options and any other operation for manipulation
    of data. Data from different

    instruments, deployment conﬁgurations, retrieval strategies, etc., need to be
    stored uniformly so all the

    system’s features are available for all datasets.

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6472

    5.2.

    Interactive Filters and Operators

    Having the data uniformly stored in a repository, the users can start tailoring
    datasets to their needs.

    The most basic functionality to allow this tailoring is being able to apply ﬁlters
    (e.g., only data within a

    range of values or with low error rates) and aggregation operators (e.g., showing
    daily or monthly values)

    to the datasets. Without adequate computational support, many researchers spend
    days to weeks in this

    trivial task. Figure 4 shows our interface for a few of these ﬁlters to achieve
    the target data, from the

    top: which sensors to include, which time span to consider, and which times of
    the day are of interest.

    The screen shown is to extract and download a dataset to be used with other tools.
    Several other options

    are also available, including ﬁltering out errors, showing raw values (e.g., of
    voltages, electrical current,

    or unconverted pulse counts), ﬁle and content formats, including data derived
    from the sensor readings,

    among others.

    Figure 4. Data retrieval options.

    Offering quick and easy access to the (corrected and quality checked) sensor readings
    from

    a deployment is one of the most essential features of our solution.

    However, also having data

    that can be derived from from these readings as easily accessible is what shows
    the actual

    potential for data management systems like ours. Our current implementation offers
    the automatic

    calculation of vegetation indexes, NDVI and EVI, from solar radiation ﬂux sensors
    using different

    methodologies [46–49]. Other products are currently being integrated into Enviro-Net,
    including LAI,

    Vapour Pressure Deﬁcit (VPD), spatial distribution for Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically
    Active

    Radiation (fAPAR).

    5.3.

    Visualization

    After tailoring a dataset to speciﬁc goals, adequate visualization tools allow
    easier understanding

    of events and trends within the monitored areas. The most basic visual tool is
    graphing the sensor

    readings of different variables, allowing visual comparison and insight on the
    measurements in one

    deployment. However, two features in our web system proved to be invaluable: graphing
    of datasets that

    went trough transformations (ﬁltering, aggregation and derived data) and graphing
    across deployments.

    These graphing options are depicted on the left side of Figure 5, which shows
    derived NDVI (using the

    methodology in [48]) for two different deployments in the Mata Seca State Park,
    in Brazil, within a

    speciﬁc time span, using only readings close to midday (between 10:00 AM and 2:00
    PM local time),

    ﬁltering out seemingly cloudy days (i.e., including only data records when the
    measured incoming PAR

    is more than 900 microeinsteins per second per square meter—µE/m2/s), and aggregating
    the data in

    daily averages.

    Figure 5. Visualization of derived NDVI (left) and spatial distribution of temperature
    and its

    reliability (right).

    The right side of Figure 5 shows another type of visualization strategy based
    on the spatial distribution

    of the readings. The graph on the left site uses a color scale to represent variation
    temperature across an

    area covered by 12 temperature sensors in the Chamela Reserve in Mexico. The graph
    on the right shows

    the coverage of the installed sensors (indicating the reliability of the scale),
    highlighting sensor failures

    when these occur. Within the speciﬁed time span, the system generated a sequence
    of images which

    are animated using the controls at the bottom to show the evolution of the temperature
    and reliability

    distributions through time. This is a useful tool to observe cyclic (e.g., diurnal
    or seasonal) changes in

    the monitored areas.

    Concluding Remarks

    This paper presented the Enviro-Net Project, which addresses a variety of issues
    related to in-situ (or

    ground-based) monitoring of ecosystems, from the deployment of sensors to the
    delivery of processed

    data products. A combination of factors make this project unique: (i) acquisition
    of data at ecosystem

    Sensors 2011, 11

    6474

    level with high spatial and temporal resolutions; (ii) long term, ground-based
    monitoring; (iii) use

    of heterogeneous, commercially available, and inexpensive equipment, including
    wireless sensing

    technologies; and (iv) integrated data management solution, with a Web-based user
    interaction with

    data products.

    This scenario, which is increasingly being adopted by other research projects,
    is described in detail

    in the paper, discussing lessons learned and pointing out aspects that require
    attention and could go

    unnoticed before deployment efforts are well underway. The paper examines not
    only technical issues

    of deploying ground-based sensor systems, but also the logistics behind execution
    and maintenance of

    deployments, issues related to data retrieval, veriﬁcation and quality, and publication
    of data products.

    The paper discussed evidence that this kind of research was needed, integrating
    solution to from a

    number of research efforts and offering a real solution in-situ long term environmental
    monitoring at

    high resolution temporal and spatial.

    Current efforts include: improving our deployment protocols to deal with arising
    problems and

    simplifying the maintenance related tasks; extending our data management system
    in order to handle

    larger amounts of data; and adding new data manipulation operations to offer more
    derived data products.

    As future work, we intend to focus on data provenance visualization issues, to
    improve understanding

    of how data products were generated and allowing automation of reproducibility.
    Another aspect to be

    explored in future releases of our data management system is the integration of
    remote sensing data (from

    satellite and airborne instruments) into our common interface [57], allowing analysis
    and comparison

    of these types of data with ground-based data. We also plan to work on implementing
    programmatic

    interfaces to allow software-based access to our data by, for instance, using
    Open Geospatial Consortium

    protocols. Lastly, we have plans to include monitoring of equipment life expectancy,
    particularly of

    sensors and wireless collector node equipment, in order to create better models
    for maintenance of

    long term deployments—by, for instance, increasing the precision of required replacement
    rates for

    equipment.

    \ feed for ruminants and biogas production and are often\nstored in large stacks.\
    \ When a silo is ﬁlled, a plastic cover is laid out and fermentation begins. From\n\
    this moment, the entire silo becomes a black box for farmers: if any spoilage\
    \ due to air breaches takes\nplace, it often will only be recognized when the\
    \ stack is opened and massive losses have already\noccurred. In the present work,\
    \ a wireless sensor monitoring system for silage stacks is designed that\nshall\
    \ detect changes in the silage environment until feedout and can therefore enable\
    \ the farmer to\nprevent biomass losses. The nail-shaped node design offers elevated\
    \ feed safety opportunities and\ncan be easily removed before feedout. For data\
    \ transmission, LoRaWAN is used in combination with\na hardware-based timer. The\
    \ sensor nodes are able to endure the full extent of a silage stack storage\n\
    period in a full-scale silage test of approximately 40 weeks without battery shortage.\
    \ The resulting\nmeasurements show that CO2, O2, relative humidity and temperature\
    \ sensors at the silage surface\ncan detect changes within the silage environment\
    \ due to air breach. Temperatures in stable regions\nbeneath 40 cm can be detected\
    \ and give information about long-term stability.\nKeywords: silage sensor; wireless\

    \ Introduction\nSilage quality is of paramount importance with respect to ruminant\
    \ feeding and in\nbiogas production operations [1–4]. More than ever, the decline\
    \ in cow grazing in Europe [5]\nstipulates the need for premium forages to ensure\
    \ optimal productivity. To guarantee a\nhigh-quality silage, establishing an airtight\
    \ seal directly after ensiling is necessary, which\ncan be achieved by covering\
    \ the ensiled material with plastic [6]. Without a seal, silage\nquality is impaired\
    \ due to energy and dry matter losses [7]. When the plastic ﬁlm is\ndamaged, air\
    \ ingress occurs; when combined with bad compaction rates, yeasts and molds\n\
    multiply, inducing massive losses inside the silage [8].\nAccording to Köhler\
    \ et al. [9], losses inside the silage stack in particular must be\nreduced. To\
    \ maintain an elevated level of silage quality, consistently executed controlling\
    \ of\nthe silo is recommended. Although it is possible to conduct silage controlling,\
    \ as mentioned\nby several authors [10–12], this is often only performed selectively.\
    \ Consequently, once the\nsilage stack is sealed, the whole silo becomes a “black\
    \ box” for farmers. For the reasons\nmentioned, the automated controlling of silages\
    \ could potentially assure higher quality [13]\nand prevent losses, thereby greatly\
    \ beneﬁting farmers with regard to economical savings.\nFurthermore, if losses\
    \ are minimized, the carbon footprint of fodder-making could be as\nwell [14].\
    \ To date, however, no automated systems for detecting destructive conditions\
    \ in\nsilage have been put into practice, despite extensive research on this topic\
    \ since the 1990s,\nexhibited by [15].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12040892\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n2 of 25\nInitial\
    \ attempts of sensor-based silage controlling tools were invasive to the plastic\n\
    cover, leading to breakage of the airtight ﬁlm [16]. However, such invasive approaches\
    \ are\nnot expedient. Any detectable breach of the ﬁlm must be methodically sealed\
    \ to prevent a\npoint of entry for oxygen or rainwater itself [15]. Yet, few investigations\
    \ of noninvasive\nmethods of silage controlling based on the wireless sensor networks\
    \ have been published.\nFor the ﬁrst time, such an approach for practical use\
    \ in agriculture was reported by [15].\nThe authors collected temperature and\
    \ humidity data within the silage, as well as air\nand soil temperature outside\
    \ of the silage stack. An improved approach of this research\nwas shown by [17],\
    \ now additionally equipped with an oxygen sensor. Another attempt\nwas shown\
    \ by [18], based on temperature and pH value. Despite [17] concluding with\nthe\
    \ perspective that their diagnostic system can be implemented in a farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), no implementation has so far taken place. Nonetheless,\
    \ an\nautomated sensor-based system for monitoring potential threats in the silage\
    \ environment\nwould be a powerful tool to maintain silage quality.\nIn this paper,\
    \ we show a novel system design for a silage monitoring system based on\na wireless\
    \ sensor network that can detect silage environment deviations caused not only\
    \ by\nair breaches, attained by collecting additional factors rather than exclusively\
    \ temperature\nor oxygen. Conducive to reaching a high level of practicability,\
    \ emphasis is placed on\nsimplicity, reliability, and applicability. Furthermore,\
    \ the system shall be tested under\npractical conditions, not only to record normal\
    \ silage behavior, but to also capture air\nbreach events and reach a Technology\
    \ Readiness Level 5.\nFor the system design, several aspects must be considered:\n\
    •\nHardware development (node);\n•\nConnectivity;\n•\nEnergy management;\n•\n\
    Data management.\nFor testing the system, a threefold approach is chosen:\n•\n\
    Pre-testing (sensor validation) in jars (year 1);\n•\nTesting prototype in ﬁeld\
    \ conditions (year 1);\n•\nField testing on TUM research farm (year 2).\nSupplementary\
    \ to capturing datasets pertaining to the statistical analysis of sensor sys-\n\
    tem performance and silage stock processes, ﬁeld testing provides insights into\
    \ the practical\nhandling and limitations of the sensor system regarding insertion,\
    \ exertion, maintenance,\nand general handling.\nWithin the iterative development\
    \ process, two distinctive sensor iterations have been\ndeveloped and proofed.\n\
    Following a review of the present literature, this article shows three different\
    \ parts of the\nsystem development. In each main chapter, the basic module design\
    \ requirements are first\naddressed (Sections 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1), followed by hardware\
    \ and connectivity specifications\n(Sections 3.2, 4.2 and 5.2) and finally testing\
    \ and validation (Sections 3.3, 4.3 and 5.3), before\nimparting a final conclusion.\n\
    2. Literature Review\n2.1. Silage Process\nThe basic principles of ensiling must\
    \ be accounted for in order to set measurable\nparameters. Immediately after airtight\
    \ sealing of green material, ensiling begins. This is\ndriven by anaerobic fermentation\
    \ of the fodder, established by lactic acid bacteria [19].\nEnsiling and storage\
    \ can be divided into different stages. These include the “aerobic phase”,\n“fermentation\
    \ phase” and “stable phase”. A fourth phase following storage is designated\n\
    as the “feed-out phase” [19,20]. When silage is sealed airtight, the remaining\
    \ oxygen is\ndischarged [19]. H2O, CO2 and NH3 are formed from water-soluble carbohydrates\
    \ and\nproteins [20]. These conversion processes lead to an increase in silage\
    \ temperature. One\ndeﬁning characteristic of the aerobic phase is the brief duration,\
    \ which lasts only a few\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n3 of 25\nhours [10,19,21]. The\
    \ subsequent silage fermentation phase then begins with a distinct\nshift to an\
    \ anaerobic status. A rapid emergence of lactic acid bacteria further favors\n\
    fermentation, leading to a pH value decrease [19,20,22]. However, anaerobic germs\
    \ are still\nable to multiply, which can lead to spoilage [21,23]. Typically,\
    \ within this phase, nitrous\ngases such as N2O, NO and NO2 [24] as well as NH3\
    \ are formed [25,26]. If sealing coverage\nis sufﬁcient, this gas formation can\
    \ be seen at the very beginning of the fermentation phase\nby a rising of the\
    \ plastic ﬁlm [27]. Combined with moisture, some of these gases react,\nyielding\
    \ aggressively dangerous nitrous acids [21,27]. When the fermentation process\
    \ ends,\nnitrous gas concentrations decrease as they are reduced to N2 und H2O\
    \ [24].\nDuring the aerobic and fermentation phases, the levels of CO2 and N2\
    \ rise to a sum of\nnearly 100% of the total gas concentration beneath the ﬁlm\
    \ [28]. According to Wang and\nBurris [24], nitrogen is displaced by carbon dioxide\
    \ throughout this step. However, no\nspeciﬁc ratio between N2 and CO2 is given.\
    \ Most of these changes occurring within the\nsilage will endure the storage period.\
    \ Respectively, the silage is in a stable phase and only\nfew proteins and sugars\
    \ are dismantled [19,21].\nThe literature indicates that gas ﬂow inside silage\
    \ is limited [15,29]. It can therefore\nbe deduced that sufﬁcient gas measurements\
    \ must take place close to the silo surface. If\nthe ﬁlm is damaged, air will\
    \ enter the area beneath the ﬁlm, resulting in a change in the\nsilage atmosphere\
    \ prior to silage spoilage. Likewise, temperatures at the surface thereafter\n\
    will also change due to spoilage. Within the silage stack, however, temperatures\
    \ should be\nstable below 40 cm and not inﬂuenced by external temperatures [30].\
    \ Consequently, silage\ntemperatures within the stack and at the surface may be\
    \ important variables for long-term\nstability measurements.\n2.2. Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks in Agriculture\nAccording to [31], despite agriculture being one of\
    \ the foundational systems of our\nworld, it has not yet been thoroughly digitalized.\
    \ The authors attribute this to the multi-\nfactorial, complex production system.\
    \ Nevertheless, due to cost effectiveness, low power\nconsumption, and easy implementation,\
    \ wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been re-\nceiving more attention in present\
    \ day (precision) agriculture [31–33], horticulture [34,35]\nand smart cities\
    \ [36]. As one of the most important aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT),\n\
    sensor nodes within a WSN are capable of sending data from areas that are hard\
    \ to access\nor within hostile environments [36]. Often, the data within agricultural\
    \ WSNs can be\nconsidered modest in size [32], so that even low-power wide-area\
    \ networks (LPWANs)\ncan be used. For applications requiring wireless data transmission,\
    \ a variety of wireless\ncommunication technologies are given in [37,38]. Their\
    \ advantages and disadvantages\nare shown by [38]. The implementation of WSNs\
    \ and different topologies, protocols and\narchitectures are given as shown by\
    \ [36]. The properties of a WSN are dependent on\nthe amount of data to be sent\
    \ and energy consumption and supply, but also shielding\nof the wireless signal.\
    \ Especially prevalent in the agricultural context is the lack of grid-\nsupplied\
    \ power due to rural distances, making batteries, solar panels, and low-power\n\
    soft- and hardware designs a necessity [32]. Actual research often shows a setup\
    \ for WSN\nup to simulations or the visualization of gained data [36,37,39,40]\
    \ and includes the stages\n“(i) data collection, (ii) processing, (iii) data analysis,\
    \ and (iv) decision making” [34]. The\nrapid evolution of such WSNs shows the\
    \ need for data protection against third parties\nwithin the whole network system,\
    \ “from the source node (origin) to the receiver (destina-\ntion) in the communication\
    \ network and application for data processing and storing” [31].\n2.3. Technical\
    \ Fundamentals of Existing Silage Monitoring Tools\nOnly two attempts have been\
    \ made to implement a noninvasive sensor node for silage.\nThe technical parameters\
    \ of these attempts are described below.\nIn the ﬁrst-ever mentioned attempt,\
    \ described by [15,17], data transmission took place\nwirelessly via a 433 MHz\
    \ transceiver and a 10-bit A/D converter within a single hop\nnetwork system.\
    \ A single 3.6 V, 1.2 Ah lithium battery acted as the power source [17].\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 892\n4 of 25\nBattery life was estimated to be 120 days. The sensor\
    \ nodes were ball-shaped and meant to\nbe implemented between 50 to 10 cm beneath\
    \ the silage surface [15,17]. The material used\nfor the protective housing was\
    \ not mentioned. Next to temperature, humidity and later\noxygen, weather data\
    \ were obtained to feed a computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) model\nto predict\
    \ temperature and oxygen trends of the silage. Tests were only conducted in a\n\
    test silo of 3 × 1.5 × 0.5 m (lwh), not under direct practical conditions. The\
    \ results were\nnot sufﬁcient as the model showed deviations between prediction\
    \ and actual oxygen and\ntemperature levels, directly after the beginning of the\
    \ trial [17]. The actual behavior of the\nsensors when an air breach is conducted\
    \ therefore cannot securely be described.\nThünen et al. [18] utilized temperature\
    \ and pH sensor technologies to predict silage\nspoilage. Additionally, movement\
    \ and position were gained to retrieve the sensor node\nwithin the silage stack\
    \ during the feed-out phase. A density sensor was intended to give\nfeedback about\
    \ the silage density during the ensiling phase. The temperature sensor in\nthis\
    \ case had a range of −20–100 ◦C with an accuracy of 0.5 ◦C. Two 3.6 V, 13 Ah\
    \ LSH20\nLithium batteries provided a power source. The estimated battery time\
    \ was one year. Data\ntransmission in this research was achieved by using a 169\
    \ MHz Band. Communication\nbetween the nodes and Gateway worked bidirectionally.\
    \ This node resembles the node\nby [15,17] but is additionally equipped with a\
    \ spike in which the pH sensor takes place. The\nnode is made of Acrylonitrile\
    \ Butadiene Styrene (ABS) using a 3D printing process. Since\nthis node also serves\
    \ as a density sensor for the silage, it must be placed during ensiling\nand is\
    \ therefore also located inside the silage, underneath the surface. Tests in large-scale\n\
    silage stacks were primarily conducted, e.g., to conﬁrm general measurement and\
    \ data\ntransmission possibilities and the general functionality. Furthermore,\
    \ in this study, no test\nwas described assessing air inﬁltration under practical\
    \ conditions.\nThe above-mentioned research presented limits regarding implementation,\
    \ usability,\nand results. At no point were air breaches under practical conditions\
    \ in a large-scale silo\nevaluated and until presently, the sensors have not been\
    \ factored into practice. The behavior\nof those systems under legitimate practical\
    \ conditions in addition to a conducted air breach\ncannot be described as sufﬁcient.\n\
    3. Materials and Methods\nThe scheme of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is\
    \ followed in this research paper.\nAccording to [41], the TRLs “are used to assess\
    \ the maturity of a new technology towards\nfull economic operation.” The TRL\
    \ scale consists of 9 steps, from TRL 1 to TRL 9 which\nare, e.g., deﬁned by DIN-EN\
    \ 16603-11 [42], or by [43]. By the end of this chapter, TRL 1\n(basic principles\
    \ observed and reported) and TRL 2 (technology concept and/or application\nformulated)\
    \ will be reached. Over the course of the experiment, Technology Readiness\nLevel\
    \ (TRL) 5 (component critical function veriﬁcation in a relevant environment)\
    \ and the\nbeginning of TRL 6 (model demonstrating the critical functions of the\
    \ element in a relevant\nenvironment) [42] shall be reached.\n3.1. Module Design\
    \ Requirements\nFollowing Green et al. [15], a wireless sensor node inside a silage\
    \ stack has several\nadvantages. According to the authors, the cover is still\
    \ sealed and a long-term data collec-\ntion with suitable scales and resolutions\
    \ (compared to traditional methods) is provided.\nFurthermore, they state that\
    \ a “wireless sensor’s intimate connection with its immediate\nphysical environment\
    \ allows each sensor to provide detailed information that is difﬁcult to\nobtain\
    \ through traditional instrumentation such as invasive electrodes or probes.”\n\
    Sensor nodes must be able to withstand the detrimental environment of silage.\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of a housing structure include robustness against inﬂuences from\
    \ silage, protection\nof sensors and other electronics, as well as protection\
    \ of the silage against defective elec-\ntronics; a possibility in such instances\
    \ as leaking batteries. These properties are seen as the\nminimum requirements\
    \ for a sensor node.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n5 of 25\nAs the literature shows,\
    \ changes are anticipated, especially at the silage surface. To\nlocate the node\
    \ securely and retrievably, its head should stay even with the silage surface\n\
    and its body must contain all necessary sensors and hardware. Requirements of\
    \ the system\nfor practical usage include both easy insertion and easy removal\
    \ of the sensor node.\nBefore any spoilage of the silage is visible, losses between\
    \ 5–20% may already be\npresent [44]. It can be conveyed, therefore, that changes\
    \ within the silage and the silage\natmosphere take place inertially. Consistent\
    \ with these parameters, measurements in the\nsilo stock with a time interval\
    \ of up to one hour are sufﬁcient to record changes. Between\nmeasurements, the\
    \ sensors can be shut down to save battery.\n3.2. Hardware and Connectivity Speciﬁcation\n\
    To develop a comprehensive overview about the silage state, a variety of sensors\
    \ are\nneeded. After reviewing the silage-related literature, the following parameters\
    \ shall be\ntested regarding their information value for the proposed aim:\n•\n\
    Temperature (◦C) at surface and in 40 cm depth,\n•\nOxygen concentration (%),\n\
    •\nCarbon dioxide concentration (%),\n•\nHumidity (%),\n•\nAir pressure (hPa).\n\
    3.2.1. Sensors and Batteries\nAs the standard storage time of a silo can last\
    \ up to one year, speciﬁc required sensors\nwere chosen to account for low energy\
    \ consumption to facilitate 365 days of measurement.\nFurther technical requirements\
    \ of all sensors are composed of adequate measurement\nranges. With respect to\
    \ temperature, values from −30 ◦C (depending on the local climate)\nup to 70 ◦C\
    \ (representative of a hot summer day with high sun exposure) should be\nanticipated.\
    \ Oxygen sensors maintaining a measurement range between 0 and 21% (actual\namount\
    \ in the air) are functionally sufﬁcient. As the literature demonstrates, CO2\
    \ and N2\nadd up to an amount of 100% in total. As no speciﬁc maximum is shown\
    \ in the literature, a\nCO2 sensor with a range from 0 to 100% is assumed to be\
    \ capable of measuring any amount\npresent. Regarding humidity, it is known from\
    \ the literature that water is a decomposition\nproduct consequent of ensiling.\
    \ Therefore, a humidity sensor with a measurement range\nfrom 0 to 100% is obligatory.\
    \ No speciﬁc information regarding air pressure is given in\nthe literature. Thus,\
    \ a standard air pressure sensor capable of collecting measurements\nbetween 15\
    \ to 115 kPa would be appropriate. To satisfy these requirements, a variety of\n\
    off-the-shelf sensors could be used, especially for temperature, humidity, and\
    \ air pressure\nmeasurements. However, to utilize oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors\
    \ that meet the\nrequirements, a limited number of sensors show adequate performance.\
    \ For a better\noverview, the sensors are listed in Table 1. As two distinctive\
    \ sensor iterations have been\ndeveloped and proofed, both hardware properties\
    \ are shown in the following.\nAs temperature sensors in early-stage nodes, the\
    \ temperature modules “RTR-502L” by\nT&D corporation with a measuring range of\
    \ −60 to 155 ◦C and an accuracy of ±0.3 ◦C at\n−20 to 80 ◦C were used. The second\
    \ sensor generation was equipped with analogue Pt100\nsensors of accuracy type\
    \ B and a MU-PT100-U010 transducer to convert output voltage to a\nrange from\
    \ 0 to 5 V.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n6 of 25\nTable 1. Overview of used sensors\

    4500 mAh\nA chemical “ME2-O2-Φ 20 Oxygen Sensor” from “Zhengzhou Winsen Electronics\n\
    Technology Co., Ltd.” with a measuring range of 0 to 25% was used for the detection\
    \ of\nO2 with a sensitivity of 0.05~0.15 mA in the air and an input voltage of\
    \ 3.3 or 5 V [45]. A\npre-heat time period of about 30 min is required [45].\n\
    For CO2 measurement, an NDIR-based “COZIR Wide Range Sensor” (0 to 100%)\nwith\
    \ an accuracy of ±5% and a 3.3 V current supply was chosen. Energy consumption\
    \ is\nspeciﬁed with 22 mA [46].\nAn HIH-4000 Sensor by Honeywell is powered for\
    \ relative humidity measurement.\nSupply voltage amounts may range between 4 to\
    \ 5.6 V with typical 200 µA and maximum\n500 µA current supply. Accuracy is speciﬁed\
    \ with ±3.5% [47].\nFor air pressure, an MPX4115 with a supply voltage of 4.85\
    \ to 5.1 V and 7 to 10 mA\ncurrent supply is used. Accuracy is speciﬁed with ±1.5%\
    \ [48].\nFor initial tests, 868 MHz data transmission modules are used. These\
    \ modules, named\n“RTR-500”, are provided by T&D Corporation, Matsumoto, Japan.\
    \ Each RTR module has\nits own battery (Saft LS 26500) with 3.6 V and 7.700 mAh,\
    \ which includes the temperature\nsensors. Within the RTR nodes, 4 NiMh batteries\
    \ with 1.2 V and 13,000 mAh power oxygen\nand carbon dioxide sensors, which run\
    \ at 3.3 V, and two Li-ion 26,650 with 3.7 V and\n4500 mAh are used for powering\
    \ air pressure and humidity sensors at 5 V. For a better\noverview, power sources\
    \ are assigned to the individual sensors in Table 1.\nIn the second node iteration,\
    \ LoRa transmission modules “Arduino MKR 1300” are\nused. LoRa is a wireless data\
    \ transmission technology, which typically runs at 868 MHz in\nGermany [49]. Such\
    \ boards consist of 8 digital I/O ports and 7 analog input ports. LoRa is\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 892\n7 of 25\nused as it is reportedly known for its wide range usage,\
    \ relatively low power consumption\nand robustness against interferences [31,37].\
    \ Furthermore, the hardware is highly cost-\nefﬁcient without monthly fees as\
    \ required by the usage of other networks [37]. These nodes\nconsist of one format\
    \ of 6 Li-ion 26,650 with 3.7 V and 4500 mAh, each connected in series.\nThese\
    \ batteries power the microcontroller board, humidity and air pressure sensors\
    \ with\n5 V and two Pt100 sensors with 12 V. In another format, two 1.2 V and\
    \ 13,000 mAh NiMh\nbatteries empower oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors with 3.3\
    \ V (Table 1).\nThe introduced hardware must resist the oxidative environment\
    \ within a silo. Basic\nhardware, such as transmitting modules, timer circuits\
    \ or batteries can be secured by\nmodiﬁcation of node design within an extra housing.\
    \ The sensors, however, must be\nexposed to the environment for adequate measurement\
    \ collections. As no sensor fulﬁlls\nany hardware protection requirements at factory\
    \ default, the protection of used sensors\nmust be ensured otherwise. For this\
    \ purpose, an epoxy coating is tested.\n3.2.2. Connectivity and Data Management\n\
    A wireless sensor node inside a silage stack on a farm requires a sufﬁcient connectivity\n\
    solution. Since silos can be built farther from the farm, reliable data transmission\
    \ must\nbe ensured even over distances greater than 100 m. Often on farms, no\
    \ farm-wide area\nnetwork is established. Therefore, a wireless data network with\
    \ low power consumption\nand reliable data transmission needs to be installed\
    \ from the node up to data storage\nand evaluation.\nIn the ﬁrst sensor node iteration,\
    \ to reach a high data resilience, each sensor is attached\nto an RTR module,\
    \ which is capable of storing data for over seven days. Data packages\nof each\
    \ sensor can be gained via an 868 MHz wireless connection on demand. If one RTR\n\
    module fails, only the data of the sensor attached to this speciﬁc RTR module\
    \ are lost.\nData from this ﬁrst node iteration were manually collected via a\
    \ gateway after ca.\n7 days with the “RTR-500 for Windows” software and transformed\
    \ into a .txt ﬁle. Manual\ntransmission was chosen to ensure that no transmission\
    \ issues lead to a lack of data.\nThe second sensor node iteration, equipped with\
    \ a LoRa microcontroller, can obtain\ndata from all sensors at the same time.\
    \ As the network topology, a simple star topology is\nused, as only low inﬂuences\
    \ by, e.g., obstacles, can be awaited, and a close line of sight can\nbe assumed.\
    \ Furthermore, due to the implementation of a hardware-based timer board,\nmulti-hop\
    \ systems are impractical. The LoRa microcontroller sends data automatically via\n\
    868 MHz when it awakens from deep sleep mode. Therefore, Over The Air Activation\n\
    (OTAA) with an ﬁxed authentication (“root”) key within the LoRa device is used,\
    \ which\nis recognized by the LoRaWAN network server for authentication. With\
    \ the help of this\nauthentication key, which will not be sent during a connection\
    \ between device and gateway,\nso-called “session keys” are generated by the network\
    \ server, which will be renewed by\nevery new connection [50]. No data storage\
    \ is given within this node. The data are sent to\na Multitech MTCDT-246A-868-EU-GB\
    \ LoRa gateway, which directs the data package via\nthe Internet to a LoRaWAN\
    \ Network Server, called “The Things Network”. From this, the\ndata are derived\
    \ by a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and stored in a continuous .txt\nﬁle\
    \ for each node on Network-Attached Storage (NAS). The general structure of a\
    \ wireless\nsensor network for such a purpose can be seen by [51] and is abstractly\
    \ shown in Figure 1.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n8 of 25\nAgronomy 2022, 12, x FOR\

    \ at the surface. The core temperature of the silage also gives information \n\
    about long term stability; therefore, another temperature sensor was attached\
    \ at the spike \nof the sensor housing. When LoRa Boards for data transmission\
    \ were implemented, the \nnode design was revised. A revised version is shown\
    \ in Figure 4. The second-generation \nnodes (iteration two) have a smaller head\
    \ as the spike now contains the batteries, and the \nLoRa microcontroller is smaller\
    \ than the previously used RTR transmission modules. Ac-\ncordingly, the spike’s\
    \ diameter is bigger in iteration two to contain the batteries (I1 = 25 \nmm,\
    \ I2 = 34 mm). This resulted in issues implementing the sensor nodes into the\
    \ silo.  \nFigure 2. Test setup in large-scale silo. Numbers show the sensor nodes,\

    \ keep full functionality. However, after extraction, O2 sensors\nindicated a\
    \ lack of functionality in some cases, while RH sensors still worked sufﬁciently.\n\
    As the temperature sensors are placed inside the hermetic hardware volume, these\
    \ were\nnot affected by the silage environment at all.\n4.2.2. Timer Circuit and\
    \ Energy Sufﬁciency\nAs mentioned in the aim of this work, the battery life of\
    \ the sensor must endure at\nleast a 365-day storage period. To ensure this aim,\
    \ a hardware-based timer circuit was\ndesigned, based on an NE555 and two AQZ\
    \ 202 PhotoMos to create an astable ﬂip-ﬂop.\nAs the O2 sensor requires a 30 min\
    \ preheat time, it was not shut down by the timer\ncircuit. Due to the implemented\
    \ timer circuit, approximately every 17:03 min (ranging\nfrom 16:32 to 17:55 min),\
    \ sensors are started, and one data package is delivered per node.\nDue to hardware\
    \ speciﬁcations, which can differ within a part, and time of connection\nto the\
    \ gateway, the mean time differed slightly between the nodes. So, within a day,\n\
    approximately 84.5 measurements per node are possible when batteries are fully\
    \ loaded.\nSensor iterations in this research were tested to evaluate energy consumption.\
    \ Hereby,\nboth power circuits (NiMh and Li-Ion) were considered separately. The\
    \ results were\ncalculated for a whole year. Results can be seen in Table 2. The\
    \ capacity for each power\ncircuit (NiMh and Li-ion) is sufﬁcient for 365 days.\
    \ The additional batteries for empowering\nthe RTR data loggers are not shown\
    \ within the table.\nTable 2. Calculated energy usage and available amount of\

    \ was evaluated within the large-scale silage test, with four repetitions\nof\
    \ iteration one and seven repetitions of iteration two executed.\nData transmission\
    \ of iteration one with RTR 500 modules was adequate despite trans-\nmission problems\
    \ occurring sometimes. The data sampling rate of the RTR 500 modules\nwas one\
    \ point per minute as no speciﬁc options could be chosen by default (e.g., only\n\
    measurements when voltage of sensors is high). As only oxygen and temperature\
    \ were\npowered full time, the data density of these sensors exceeded the data\
    \ density of the others,\nwhich showed valid measurements when being turned on\
    \ by the timer board (after approxi-\nmately 17:03 min). Due to minute interval\
    \ measurements, zeros occurred in the data of CO2,\nhumidity and air pressure,\
    \ which had to be extracted by post-processing. Approximately\nevery 7 days, the\
    \ stored data packages were manually transmitted via wireless connection.\nSeveral\
    \ times within the trial, however, some modules’ data could not be gained by the\n\
    installed gateway as no connection to the modules could be established. As a result,\
    \ an\nindividual used a second gateway attached to a laptop and moved near (<3\
    \ m) to the nodes\nto transmit data from this point. These issues were not observed\
    \ with iteration two nodes.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n12 of 25\nFigure 5 shows\
    \ the course of the delivered data packets of the LoRa sensor nodes\nwithin the\
    \ trial. Data were sampled when the timer circuit turned on the power after\n\

    \ to detect air breaches and spoilage within\na silo with speciﬁcally designed\
    \ sensor nodes. The design and insertion differ between\npreviously reported research\
    \ and the literature: it is not meant to be placed beneath the\nsilage surface,\
    \ but rather, the head should stay even with the silage surface and immersed\n\
    into the silo after compaction, before putting the plastic on it. This way, gas\
    \ sensors also stay\nat the surface and yield more reliable results than earlier\
    \ published experimental attempts\nas gas ﬂow within the silage is proven to be\
    \ very limited [15,29]. The insertion method of\nthe sensor was conﬁrmed to be\
    \ effective. In some cases, due to high compaction rates, it\nwas necessary to\
    \ predrill a hole for the spikes of the node with a steel stick. Removal from\n\
    the other side was then feasible before feed-out so that no damage to the hardware\
    \ was\ncaused, a previously potential occurrence with silage removal machinery\
    \ in research trials.\nAs the node’s heads were fastened with blue tape, their\
    \ surface contrasted with the silage\nand were easily found. Due to the V2A steel,\
    \ they could easily be pulled out. In general,\napplicability and handling of\
    \ the sensor module appeared functional; high practicability is\nassumed. However,\
    \ the module design should be developed in speciﬁc ways. One could\nimprove the\
    \ insertion of the modules further, by designing the nail as small as possible\
    \ in\ndiameter, while a thread on the nail could support insertion as well. As\
    \ Rees et al. [29] state,\nsilage typically has a low gas diffusion rate. Within\
    \ the shown modules, all sensors except\ntemperature are attached to one side\
    \ of the module; they are connected to all sides with a\ngrid and space for gas\
    \ diffusion. While gas ﬂow may ﬁnd its way to the sensor devices,\nhumidity in\
    \ particular showed changes in the uppermost layer of silage within the test silo\n\
    when air ingress occurred and should therefore be measured at the highest point\
    \ possible.\nIn a future generation, sensors should not be attached to a side\
    \ of the module but on top\nof it, directly underneath a lid to be protected from\
    \ direct heat from the sun. To reuse the\nnode, even if a sensor is broken, sensors\
    \ must be easily replaced, which can be also fulﬁlled\nby such a design. As the\
    \ spike is open to the container, it satisﬁes a prerequisite for usage\ninside\
    \ of the feed: in case a battery is leaking, undesirable contaminants will run\
    \ and be\nstored inside the spike and not contaminate the fodder. Temperature\
    \ measurements within\n40 cm of depth can be seen as a good indicator to evaluate\
    \ long-term stability of silage and\ntherefore should be collected as well. Within\
    \ this study, however, V2A steel was used as a\nbasis for the sensor nodes. As\
    \ metal has thermal conductivity, it is possible that outside\ntemperatures can\
    \ be forwarded down the sensor and inﬂuence the measurement, which\nwas seen within\
    \ the large-scale silage test. In node generation two, the batteries moved\nfrom\
    \ the top of the node into the spike. In addition to the advantage that the head\
    \ of the\nnode becomes smaller, the batteries are now more insulated against strongly\
    \ ﬂuctuating\ntemperatures in the node heads. The results of the tests show that\
    \ temperatures in the\nregion can exceed 50 ◦C in summer and dip lower than 0\
    \ ◦C in winter. With the obligatory\nsensors speciﬁed, an enhanced module can\
    \ be created and plastic forming or 3D printing\ncan be employed to create modules\
    \ quickly and economically for future research.\n5.2. Hardware Development and\
    \ Sensor Protection\nBauerdick et al. [52] state that four distinct aspects cause\
    \ sensor detriment on farms;\nthese are humidity, coldness, heat, and corrosion.\
    \ When placing a sensor inside a silage\nstack, all factors will inﬂuence the\
    \ sensors. As can be inferred from the results, humidity\nincreases to signiﬁcant\
    \ levels within a short amount of time when silage is sealed. Due to the\nfermentation,\
    \ nitrous gases are formed, such as N2O, NO or NO2 [53]. Occasionally, these\n\
    gases leak from the silo and can be identiﬁed as rust-brown fogs around the silo.\
    \ When\nthese gases react with humidity, nitrous acids can be formed which are\
    \ extremely dangerous\nfor humans [27]. These acids can also act as strong oxidizing\
    \ agents [54] and therefore harm\nsensors and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) as\
    \ well. Adapted sensor protection is therefore\ncritical. The results show that\
    \ an epoxy coating of the electronical parts of a sensor (limiting\nenvironmental\
    \ exposure exclusively to the sensor element of the apparatus) is sufﬁcient to\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 892\n18 of 25\nprotect sensors against environmental hazards\
    \ for an entire storage season. Oxygen level\ndetection was established with chemical\
    \ sensors in this trial. Since it cannot be ruled out\nthat silage gases inﬂuence\
    \ the chemical components of used sensors, in future research,\nchemical sensors\
    \ should be replaced. Limited sensor lifetimes estimated by manufacturers\nmust\
    \ also be taken into consideration for all sensors in future research.\nIn the\
    \ present research, a hardware-based timer was chosen. Software failure due to\n\
    data storage issues or otherwise can therefore be avoided.\n5.2.1. Energy Efﬁciency\n\
    Table 2 shows the available energy within the used sensor nodes, as well as the\n\
    theoretical energy values required for a one-year storage period. The calculated\
    \ results\nemphasize the results of the full-scale test to which the node iterations\
    \ endured a whole\nstorage time within a silage environment. Within this research,\
    \ the required capacity was\neven overestimated to ensure a safety buffer, as\
    \ NiMh batteries are known to have high\ndischarge rates. Therefore, for satisfactory\
    \ practical usage, the actual sensor node iterations\nneed a high quantity of\
    \ batteries in order to work properly for 365 days (RTR nodes = 6 batteries\n\
    for sensors and additional 6 batteries for the RTR-500 datalogger = 12 batteries\
    \ in total;\nLoRa node = 8 batteries in total).\nIn addition to the required space,\
    \ the recharging process is a detailed operation. A\npossibility to reduce the\
    \ number of batteries could be a charging function during the actual\nsilage storage\
    \ time. To avoid harming the foil, wireless charging methods as shown by [55]\n\
    could be used. However, this diminishes the advantages of cost efﬁciency. A slimming\
    \ of\nthe nodes’ hardware seems to be more appropriate to lower the energy demands.\
    \ When\nconsidering the testing results, it becomes obvious that air pressure\
    \ sensors can be taken\nout of consideration in future nodes. Furthermore, Pt100\
    \ sensors that need 12 V power\nshould be replaced by sensors which work at 3.3\
    \ to 5 V, such as DS18B20, to minimize\nneeded space, cost, and power consumption\
    \ in particular. Within a laboratory test, we\nevaluated a modiﬁed version of\
    \ the LoRa node with the above-mentioned changes and a\nmodiﬁed timer module.\
    \ The power consumption of the whole node decreased to 8021 mAh\nin total at 3.7\
    \ V. This consumption can be fed by only two 3.7 V, 4500 mAh batteries. As\nthe\
    \ sensor node has the capacity for at least three batteries in the spike, a security\
    \ buffer is\nsupplied, which may also be necessary if the security of the delivered\
    \ data is increased in\nfuture generations. Prodanovic et al. [31] show that in\
    \ their experimental setup with usage\nof standard LoRa, e.g., only an authentication\
    \ of a node within a network consumed up to\n7% more energy compared to no authentication.\
    \ Although an Over The Air Authentication\n(OTAA) was already used within this\
    \ research, an additional security buffer for an unusual\nthreat or loss of capacity\
    \ during storage time would be advantageous and achievable with\na third battery.\n\
    5.2.2. Data Transmission\nHigh data resilience is assigned for the trials with\
    \ the RTR module as every sensor\nis equipped with a dedicated transmission unit.\
    \ Some RTR modules, however, had trans-\nmission issues, even when a gateway was\
    \ used a few meters away to gain data manually.\nThis can lead back to signal\
    \ shielding by the module material itself, which consisted of\nV2A steel. In the\
    \ development process, these transmission units were replaced by LoRa\nmicrocontroller\
    \ boards.\nTreiber et al. [38] compare different transmission technologies. Due\
    \ to this comparison,\nit can be pointed out that especially LoRa, based on 868\
    \ MHz in Europe, fulﬁlls the need\nfor an automated silage control tool. Furthermore,\
    \ [39] states that, due to the open-source\nnetwork, a freedom of scale is given,\
    \ so that silages can be equipped with dozens of\nthe presented sensors without\
    \ the need for monthly fees. With a data rate of 0.3 up to\n50 kbit/s, a range\
    \ of up to 10 km, and a high penetration rate through objects, silos can\nbe observed\
    \ even at distant locations from the farm. It can therefore be assumed that\n\
    LoRa is able to penetrate “the three different types of obstacles that can be\
    \ generally\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n19 of 25\nencountered when deploying WSN”\
    \ [36], which include trees or mobile items, wireless-\nabsorbing or interfering\
    \ obstacles such as buildings and walls, and a line of sight without\nany obstacles\
    \ [36]. Nevertheless, to ensure these aspects, the authors of [36] advise that\n\
    it is crucial to conduct direct ﬁeld tests with newly applied ideas, which is\
    \ taken care of\nby the large-scale test. The lower the frequency, the higher\
    \ the capability of penetration\nthrough such materials as biomass [56]. With\
    \ the conception of this module, in comparison\nto those by [15] and [18], it\
    \ is not directly necessary to penetrate biomass with a signal,\nas the head of\
    \ this trial module is even with the silage surface. There are few, if not zero,\n\
    centimeters of biomass between the line of sight to the LoRa gateway. The problem\
    \ of\nlow transmission rates is negligible in these cases as the data packages\
    \ only consist of the\nsensor values and are therefore very small. However, the\
    \ RSSI, pending between −80 and\n−100, can be classiﬁed as weak [57,58]. The antennas\
    \ in this example were standard dipole\nArduino GSM Antenna for MKR 1300. It is\
    \ already mentioned within the description of\nthese antennas that metal surfaces\
    \ nearby may inﬂuence its coverage [59]. As the node\nconsists of V2A steel, this\
    \ can be identiﬁed as a potentially weak source of signal strength.\nIf the node\
    \ housing would be manufactured from plastic, possible inﬂuences of the metal\n\
    body can be eliminated in future designs.\nConsidering the data transmission rates\
    \ of the LoRa nodes, the maximum possible\namount of delivered data packages is\
    \ attained in minimal time. At the beginning of the\ntrial, approximately 80%\
    \ of possible packets are delivered, and in the end (40 weeks after\nstart) around\
    \ 50% are still delivered. This can be attributed to the fact that the battery\n\
    voltage is decreasing. A decrease in energy can lead to a decrease in reception\
    \ strength\nof a sensor network [60,61]. Referring to Figure 5, in the weeks 20\
    \ and 38, a dip in the\ntransferred packets can be observed. This breakage can\
    \ be seen with all sensors and can be\ntraced back to network issues at the farm.\
    \ The lower amount of data packages of module\n7 results from the limited time\
    \ of “on” intervals by the hardware timer. Other failures (M10\nand M8) resulted\
    \ out of battery shortage. Its origin can be connected to quality issues of\n\
    the selected hardware and soldering. A quality check run over the course of a\
    \ few days for\neach module before usage can ﬁx these problems. However, the available\
    \ data are sufﬁcient\ndue to the remaining modules. These results show that energy\
    \ conservation is of great\nimportance to ensure a long period of silage surveillance.\n\
    To avoid a lack of data due to any connectivity errors, a storage unit can be\
    \ constructed,\nwhich sends stored data when a successful connection has been\
    \ restored. Although the rates’\nmonitored parameters in this research are slow,\
    \ like in many agricultural WSN [32], 1.7 data\npackets per hour are sent at the\
    \ end of the 40-week duration, providing an appropriate\nmonitoring frequency\
    \ and exceeding the suggested amount of one packet per hour. A\nconsistent transmission\
    \ of data as requested by [32] for an WSN is assured.\nEven though the amounts\
    \ of data sent by the nodes are low, it has been demonstrated\nin other research\
    \ that analysis processes can be executed within the sensor node, and only\nthe\
    \ processed data are sent for storage or decision support [34]. This approach\
    \ is not\napplicable to this situation: depending on the location of each node\
    \ (e.g., sun-covered by\nwalls or weights of the plastic) as well as due to the\
    \ very heterogenous properties of a silage\n(DM, spores, bacteria, temperature\
    \ when being harvested, bulk density, etc.), for most of\nthe gained parameters,\
    \ no general thresholds can be calculated for every silage as proposed\nin former\
    \ research. This stands with the exception of oxygen, as such values should not\n\
    deviate far from zero after the aerobic phase. In this use case, all data need\
    \ to be analyzed\non a central system, for instance a computing machine on the\
    \ farm or intrinsic to a cloud\nsystem to evaluate the data from one silage heap\
    \ in total.\nKhalifeh et al. [36] state that a need “to develop new algorithms,\
    \ protocols, low power\nmodules” and more is still prevalent today. Critical to\
    \ the sensor node technology presented\nhere, the point of end-to-end security\
    \ for (meta-) data should be taken into focus with its\ndevelopment, as at the\
    \ moment, the LoRa modules use a standard Over The Air Activation\n(OTAA) with\
    \ a lifetime used identiﬁcation key. Prodanovi´c et al. [31] state that if this\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 892\n20 of 25\nidentiﬁcation (or “secret”) key is stolen, the\
    \ attacker is able to steal the data that is sent by a\nsensor node.\n5.3. Testing\
    \ Validation\nThe sensor data show that it is possible to detect signs of spoilage\
    \ and air breaches\nwithin the silage. The temperature within 40 cm depth can\
    \ provide adequate information\nabout long-term stability or reheating [62]. From\
    \ this trial, it can be seen that over time the\ncore temperature is decreasing.\
    \ Pries and Kayser [62] state that the core temperature of\nsilage should be below\
    \ 15 ◦C, or it is otherwise assumed that reheating and thus, spoilage,\nare occurring.\
    \ However, it can also be observed that core temperature drops down to 15 ◦C\n\
    only after more than 150 days. Thaysen [63] states that it is not expedient to\
    \ look at the core\ntemperature just once, but to permanently log data to see\
    \ whether it is ﬂuctuating. The\nauthor states that higher temperatures within\
    \ silos can also be caused by uncooled silage.\nThis permanent observation can\
    \ be granted with this sensor node.\nBy monitoring the temperature beneath the\
    \ surface, it becomes obvious that the\nsensor values are highly dependent on\
    \ outside factors such as sun radiation and outside\ntemperature. It is only during\
    \ low-temperature night conditions, when there is no sun\nradiation to inﬂuence\
    \ the sensors, that a simple standard deviation issue of the data was\npresent\
    \ after one air breach. The temperature of one node (M4), located nearly 50 cm\
    \ from\nthe breach, showed a rise four days after air breach number four.\nHowever,\
    \ biomass, such as silage in particular, has substantial insulation properties\
    \ not\nonly against heat [30,62] but also against gas ﬂow, depending on its dry\
    \ matter content and\nbulk density [8]. The higher the dry matter content of a\
    \ silage, the higher the bulk density\nshould be to prevent gas exchange [8] and\
    \ therefore reheating. With an increase in the DM\ncontent of grass silage of\
    \ 20% (from 20% to 40% DM), a higher bulk density of 70 kg DM/m3\n(from 160 to\
    \ 230 kg DM/m3) is recommended. A list of adequate bulk densities concerning\n\
    its dry matter content can be found in [64]. This indicates that if reheating\
    \ does not take\nplace adjacent to the sensor, it might not be detected with a\
    \ temperature sensor, as the\nheat may remain locally restricted. In that case,\
    \ when reheating is eventually detected,\nconsiderable damage may already have\
    \ been occurred. Nevertheless, temperature data\ncollected over long-term periods\
    \ can be used to determine the persistent stability of silages\nand therefore\
    \ act as a source for models in which weather forecast dependency provide\nguidance\
    \ to the farmer on feed-rates per silo and per week. As this research focused\
    \ on\nthe technological aspects and proof of general functionality, the bulk density\
    \ of the used\nsilage was not part of investigation. Its inﬂuence on the precision\
    \ of gathered data must be\nintegrated into future research.\nBefore any air breach\
    \ is caused, oxygen curves show an unexpected behavior during\nthe beginning of\
    \ fermentation: the curve decreases to zero within 6 h. This is slower than\n\
    the literature describes (30 min, [65]). Afterwards, a slight escalation can be\
    \ observed. This\nreaction can be explained by a cross-sensitivity of the oxygen\
    \ sensors with nitrous gases;\nalthough a surge in oxygen content after sealing\
    \ has not been cited in the literature. How-\never, as already mentioned, during\
    \ the fermentation phase, nitrous gas formations occur in\ndifferent concentrations.\
    \ NO, for example, rose within a test by [24] up to 9.71% within a\nfew hours\
    \ after ensiling and decreased to 0.12% 42 h after ensiling. A laboratory trial\
    \ with\nthe used chemical sensors and a test gas (30% NO, 70% N) indicated a deﬂection\
    \ of the\ngraph. Other nitrous gases may amplify this effect. As the nitrous gases\
    \ disappear during\nthe ﬁrst days, this explains the decrease in the graph after\
    \ several hours of fermentation.\nWith this information, the used sensor node\
    \ is not only capable of detecting air breaches or\nspoilage of silage but can\
    \ also act as a warning tool for farmers, indicating the formation of\nhighly\
    \ hazardous nitrous gases and when the area around the silo can be safely re-entered\n\
    again. The behavior of the oxygen sensors during the air breaches shows that it\
    \ is possible\nto detect a disruption of the plastic cover. However, a critical\
    \ result is that the graphs do\nnot show a constant high level of oxygen during\
    \ disruption, but rather a diurnal pattern.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n21 of 25\n\
    It is striking that in some cases, the sensor values of O2 and CO2, which are\
    \ very close\nto the damage, do not react, while sensors roughly 3 meters away\
    \ do. A reason can be\nidentiﬁed within the silage surface topography. Due to\
    \ the compaction of the silage, a\nvaried and not-homogenous surface is created\
    \ (Figure 12). Within this surface, several\ntroughs and hills can be identiﬁed.\
    \ As oxygen diffuses very slowly or not at all within\nsilage [29], modules located\
    \ behind an elevated area are isolated, while others, laying in\ntroughs, are\
    \ able to detect oxygen.\n \nfermentation. With this information, the used sensor\

    \ several \ntroughs and hills can be identified. As oxygen diffuses very slowly\
    \ or not at all within \nsilage [29], modules located behind an elevated area\
    \ are isolated, while others, laying in \ntroughs, are able to detect oxygen.\
    \  \n \nFigure 12. Topography of the full-scale silage test with grass. The surface\
    \ is not even. It is conceiva-\nble that gas flow underneath silage film therefore\
    \ is influenced by these circumstances. \nCO2 sensors largely show well-defined\
    \ breakdowns at air breach locations. As the \nsensors presented very different\
    \ analog outputs during the field test, these were tested \nafterwards with calibration\
    \ gases in a laboratory environment. Although the CO2 sensors \nwere meant to\
    \ measure up to 100%, it could be found that the measurement range of used \n\
    sensors within the trial diverged between 7.9% and 61.6%. This explains why some\
    \ sen-\nsors show a breakdown of CO2 concentration when the total concentration\
    \ of CO2 has \nreached their measuring capacity. It becomes obvious that in some\
    \ nodes, oxygen shows \nno differences while CO2 curves do so. Well-calibrated\
    \ carbon dioxide sensors are there-\nfore more capable of detecting air breaches\
    \ when complemented to oxygen measure-\nments. The literature shows that carbon\
    \ dioxide and nitrogen share a strong negative cor-\nrelation within a silo environment\
    \ [24,28]. The authors state that due to air ingress, a high \nconcentration of\
    \ nitrogen inflows displaces CO2. In line, the decrease in CO2 in the present\
    \ \nexperiment can be explained by air ingress (due to breaches or air encounters\
    \ at the silage \nwall) influencing the correlation between nitrogen and carbon\
    \ dioxide. It also shows that \nthe measurements of [66], where concentrations\
    \ of 20–40% within the upper layers of si-\nlage can be shown, are snapshots and\
    \ a comprehensive range can only be detected when \npermanent CO2 measurement\
    \ takes place. This curve has advantages for the farmer. Not \nonly can air breaches\
    \ be detected, but the overall permeability of a silo can be assessed. \nWhen\
    \ compared over several years, recommendations can be made on how a silo must\
    \ be \nmanaged to maintain a maximum efficiency of sealing (e.g., sealing the\
    \ walls, etc.).  \nHumidity levels rise during the trial, and H2O is formed by\
    \ fermentation due to ni-\ntrous gases [24]. However, the rise in humidity is\
    \ gradual within this test. Former tests \ndisclosed show faster increases in\
    \ humidity. This may be justified by the dry matter con-\ntent of the silage,\
    \ which is about 50.3%. This content is far too high and should normally \nFigure\

    \ no\ndifferences while CO2 curves do so. Well-calibrated carbon dioxide sensors\
    \ are therefore\nmore capable of detecting air breaches when complemented to oxygen\
    \ measurements. The\nliterature shows that carbon dioxide and nitrogen share a\
    \ strong negative correlation within\na silo environment [24,28]. The authors\
    \ state that due to air ingress, a high concentration\nof nitrogen inﬂows displaces\
    \ CO2. In line, the decrease in CO2 in the present experiment\ncan be explained\
    \ by air ingress (due to breaches or air encounters at the silage wall)\ninﬂuencing\
    \ the correlation between nitrogen and carbon dioxide. It also shows that the\n\
    measurements of [66], where concentrations of 20–40% within the upper layers of\
    \ silage\ncan be shown, are snapshots and a comprehensive range can only be detected\
    \ when\npermanent CO2 measurement takes place. This curve has advantages for the\
    \ farmer. Not\nonly can air breaches be detected, but the overall permeability\
    \ of a silo can be assessed.\nWhen compared over several years, recommendations\
    \ can be made on how a silo must be\nmanaged to maintain a maximum efﬁciency of\
    \ sealing (e.g., sealing the walls, etc.).\nHumidity levels rise during the trial,\
    \ and H2O is formed by fermentation due to\nnitrous gases [24]. However, the rise\
    \ in humidity is gradual within this test. Former tests\ndisclosed show faster\
    \ increases in humidity. This may be justiﬁed by the dry matter content\nof the\
    \ silage, which is about 50.3%. This content is far too high and should normally\
    \ be\naround 30% [10]. In the context of detecting air breaches or spoilage, humidity\
    \ could be\ncapable of showing changes, but often any detectable changes of the\
    \ curves lie within\n2% or maximum 5% of the values. Therefore, a more accurate\
    \ absolute sensor should be\nused, which brings up the question of how often it\
    \ must be changed within a sensor node,\nas sensors age and accuracy decreases.\
    \ Furthermore, additional peaks could be detected\nwhich have no relation to the\
    \ breaches. Respectively, future research should focus on\nAgronomy 2022, 12,\
    \ 892\n22 of 25\nexploring possible interrelationships between humidity and other\
    \ factors, implementing\nhumidity as an indicator as well.\nAir pressure was examined\
    \ as well but did not show any deviations from the outside\npressure. The sealing\
    \ conditions are not dense enough to use this as an indicator.\nWithin the full-scale\
    \ silage test, it was evident that the sensor node successfully\noperates under\
    \ speciﬁc circumstances, and it can disclose critical states beneath the plastic\n\
    cover. TRL 5 (component critical function veriﬁcation in a relevant environment)\
    \ [42]\nhas been reached. In order to minimize the number of necessary nodes within\
    \ a WSN as\nrequested by, e.g., [32], further research has to be conducted with\
    \ different silage types and\nvarying properties to ﬁnd the optimal distribution\
    \ of the nodes in a silage stack.\nIn general, especially for O2, a threshold\
    \ for future integration of an alarm system can\nbe assumed. The rapidly following\
    \ oxygen content increase after the aerobe phase in silage\nmust be evidence of\
    \ unusual behavior. Regarding CO2, it became visible that breakages\nof more than\
    \ 5% from the actual concentration are observed when air enters the stack.\nHowever,\
    \ it becomes obvious that over the entire storage period, the CO2 concentration\
    \ is\ndecreasing. This decrease can be traced back to reports of air ingress in\
    \ the literature [24,28];\nboth the ingress and course of CO2 are dependent on\
    \ several unavoidable factors such as\nsilage wall (porosity), plastic cover,\
    \ or feed out. Therefore, no one unique course can be\nforecasted for a silage.\
    \ However, the decrease in CO2 takes place inertially. To suggest\nan alarm system\
    \ working on CO2 concentration, the mean value for the last 6 h should\nbe compared\
    \ with the actual sensor value. If this mean value differs by more than 5% of\n\
    points from the actual value, an air breach can be assumed.\nOverall, the used\
    \ sensors show practicability for the use case. The requirements\ndeﬁned in Section\
    \ 3.2.1. for each sensor are appropriate. However, the calibration of used\nsensors\
    \ needs to be inspected well before their usage as standard calibration “as is”\
    \ varied\ngreatly by purchased sensors.\n6. Conclusions\nWithin this research,\
    \ the TRL 5 and the ﬁrst elements of TRL 6 are realized. Results\nshow that a\
    \ sensor node capable of detecting negative impacts on silos could be designed\n\
    and general requirements can be met. Special attention must be given for sensor\
    \ durability\nagainst the oxidative silage environment. In terms of precision,\
    \ it can be stated that CO2\ndoes not need a high-precision accuracy readout.\
    \ For this sensor, a wide measurement\nrange (0–100%) is necessary, and accuracy\
    \ of ±5% as used in this research is satisfactory,\nas breakages in CO2 are normally\
    \ at least 5% when a leakage in silage appears. As the\noxygen content should\
    \ stay close to 0% when a plastic cover is applied, precise negligible\namounts\
    \ are not critical to report. When considering the parameters of an alarm system,\
    \ it\nis only necessary to detect any amount of oxygen higher than 1%. Humidity\
    \ yielded no\nreliable results as any anomalies were in the range of measurement\
    \ errors of the sensor.\nNevertheless, humidity at surface levels should be considered\
    \ in future research. Thus, high\naccuracy (<1%) is needed. Air pressure is not\
    \ a necessary factor for sensing any harmful\nchanges. Temperature measurements\
    \ need to show a high accuracy to sense any changes in\nan early stage. As reheating\
    \ due to an oxygen breach appears in a delayed manner, it is not\na sufﬁcient\
    \ as an individual parameter, despite such use in previous research. Nevertheless,\n\
    as silage quality is dependent on these parameters, an outlook on long-term stability\
    \ can\nbe constructed, providing farmers with weather-dependent recommended feed\
    \ rates.\nData transmission via LoRa standard is adequate and, combined with low-power\n\
    sensors, provides a node battery lifetime of approximately 365 days. As the actual\
    \ sensor\nnodes require many batteries, hardware design must be adjusted: an air\
    \ pressure sensor is\nnot necessary and can be left out; temperature sensors need\
    \ to be replaced by low-voltage\nsensors. With such an adapted hardware and a\
    \ modiﬁed timer circuit, required battery\ncapacity as well as node volume can\
    \ be decreased. Data packet amounts are higher than\none packet per hour, even\
    \ at the end of long-term trials. This data volume transfer rate can\nbe granted\
    \ as effective.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 892\n23 of 25\nThe conceptualized sensor node\
    \ shows its capability to protect hardware components\nagainst the silage environment.\
    \ Nevertheless, it should be noted that the choice of the\nmodule material impacts\
    \ on temperature measurements if it is consisting of metals. Addi-\ntionally,\
    \ data transmission can be inﬂuenced by the usage of such material. Therefore,\
    \ a\nplastic-fabricated module is recommended. Sensors must be placed as close\
    \ to the silage\nsurface as possible for optimal performance.\nThe module was\
    \ effectively implemented in a relevant environment. In future research,\na provision\
    \ for the redesign of this node with plastic and exposed sensors should be made.\n\
    High amounts of data could train artiﬁcial intelligence to recognize small deviations\
    \ or\npatterns in the data as potential threats. Additionally, with an extensive\
    \ dataset over\ndifferent silage types and qualities, along with laboratory-measured\
    \ silage losses over\nstorage periods, models may be created to not only prevent\
    \ silage losses, but to also\ncalculate the actual losses due to measured changes\
    \ in the silage environment. Furthermore,\nthe collected data can contribute to\
    \ the determination and optimization of the required\nnode number per silage.\n\

  title: System Design and Validation of a Wireless Sensor Monitoring System in Silage
  verbatim_quote1: 'Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature,
    weather) and their collection and use

    Soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data can be obtained from sensors to
    detect any changes in the silage environment due to air breach.'
  verbatim_quote2: 'Location (e.g., in silage pile, on surface, near surface, in soil,
    near soil, tangential focus)

    Sensors nodes can either be placed in the silage pile, on surface, near surface,
    in soil, or near soil to collect appropriate data.'

    Abstract The challenge of improving water quality is a growing global concern,
    typified by the European Commission Water Framework Directive and the United States
    Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water quality are economics, poor water
    management, agricultural practices and urban development. This paper reviews the
    extensive role of non-point sources, in particular the outdated agricultural practices,
    with respect to nutrient and contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring
    (WQM) is currently undertaken through a number of data acquisition methods from
    grab sampling to satellite based remote sensing of water bodies. Based on the
    surveyed sampling methods and their numerous limitations, it is proposed that
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their own limitations, are still very
    attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal data collection for WQM
    applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface and ground water and
    catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge of contaminants
    trends through their high resolution observations. However, these applications
    have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology for management
    and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled agricultural
    activities and different environmental compartments for integrated water quality
    management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and WQM are identified.
    Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale is proposed for
    enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming
    activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control and
    management. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Wireless

    1. Introduction Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival
    of all ecosystems on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources
    are accessible to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground
    water (Krchnak et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient
    water for essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation,
    and domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of
    water suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required.
    Because of the unequal distribution of fresh water resources, billions of people
    around the globe live in water-stressed and water-limited environments. Therefore
    it is crucial to preserve water resources although in practice it is continually
    degraded and depleted owing to inappropriately targeted funding initiatives leading
    to poor water management, redundant and outdated agricultural practices and urban
    development (Rosegrant et al., 2002, Verhoeven et al., 2006). The key issues relating
    to global freshwater quality problems in the environment and public health are
    summarised as (FAO, 1996): (1) Non-economic cost of drinking water treatment.
    (2) Millions of annual deaths resulting from water-borne diseases. (3) Ecosystem
    dysfunction and loss of biodiversity. (4) Contamination of marine ecosystems.
    (5) Contamination of groundwater resources. (6) Depletion of usable water resources.
    (7) Deterioration of recreational activities. Problems associated with water quality
    are commonly attributed to nutrient, chemical and pathogen loadings into an aquatic
    system as a result of point source and non-point source activities (EPA, 2009).
    Discharges from point sources are identifiable and come from a single source.
    Examples include contaminants from sewage plant pipes or industries. On the other
    hand non-point source fluxes may come from diffused sources/activities with no
    direct source of entry (FAO, 1996). Examples mainly include agricultural and animal
    farming or peri-urban activities. A diagrammatic representation of major activities
    responsible for the degradation of water on a catchment scale owing to point and
    non-point sources is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Water contamination activities in a catchment. While some regulations have
    been put in place by water quality control organizations in various countries
    to control toxic and chemical loadings from point source as well as non-point
    source (Borja et al., 2004, Pollard and Huxham, 1998), they have not been as effective
    for diffuse non-point sources as for point sources (Heimlich, 2003). In order
    to prevent and reduce water pollution in the US, the use of best management practices
    (BMPs) has been proposed by the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) for controlling
    and managing agricultural practices (UNEP, 1998). However, their effectiveness
    needs to be assessed using sufficient quantities of long term data. Therefore,
    it is established that monitoring nutrient and contaminant contributions by the
    various responsible factors, at key points in a catchment, is vital in assessing
    and preventing degradation of water quality, as well as informing future regulations
    (Coles et al., 2009, Hunter and Walton, 2008). In this paper, we review the impacts
    that different stakeholders have on water resources, and explore how a single
    stakeholder can have unintended impacts on others in a catchment. Various data
    acquisition methods from grab samples to satellite images, have been used to estimate
    and model relationships of land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Shrestha et al., 2008, Bolstad and Swank, 1997, Tong and
    Chen, 2002, Lemos et al., 2007). These sampling methods are further reviewed and
    evaluated in this paper. WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring
    of surface water (rivers, lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments.
    Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity
    and nitrates have been measured. Preliminary results have been fundamental in
    advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends, although they were based on spatially
    constrained observations. Most of these were small scale prototype deployments
    and were mainly aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous
    and real-time data availability. However, these applications have yet to explore
    the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions,
    in order to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions, in an
    autonomous and dynamic manner. This requires an integration of responsible activities
    into an autonomous water quality monitoring and management mechanism. Therefore,
    the potential for including existing WSN-controlled agricultural activities and
    water bodies, for integrated water quality management, is presented in this review.
    Later, research challenges in the existing applications of WSNs in this area are
    identified which, if addressed, would enable possible extension of the existing
    techniques to an integrated monitoring program. It is argued in this paper that
    it is not feasible to have a single monitoring system covering the entire catchment
    as individual stakeholder’s monitoring requirements vary as they undertake different
    activities. However, this enables a case for collaborative networks in a catchment
    to be proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for managing water quality. The structure of
    this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the role of agricultural activities on
    water quality degradation in a catchment is discussed. Section 3 discusses existing
    data acquisition methods for WQM, and discuss their limitations, and Section 4
    investigates the ability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and management in
    a catchment. Section 5 discusses the unresolved research challenges that prevent
    wide adoption of WSNs for monitoring agricultural and water quality parameters
    and achieving water quality management in a catchment. Finally, Section 6 presents
    a case for integrated water quality management using collaboration among individually
    networked activities in a catchment, while Section 7 draws conclusions. 2. Role
    of agricultural activities on water quality degradation and ecosystem dysfunction
    in a catchment Surface and ground water contamination in a catchment is mainly
    attributed to outdated farm management practices. These include excessive use
    of fertilizers for high product yields, traditional irrigation practices, use
    of pesticides and herbicides and poorly managed animal farming operations (Moss,
    2008, EPA, 2009). Other sources include fracking, deforestation, atmospheric deposits
    by rainfall and untreated sewage waste. However, this paper focuses on the impact
    of farm management practices on water quality degradation. These practices may
    result in nutrient, chemical, pathogen and sediment fluxes with main nutrient
    issues being due to excess phosphorous and nitrogen losses (Carpenter et al.,
    1998, Hunter and Walton, 2008). 1 lists the impacts of catchment scale activities
    on the quality of surface and ground water resources. For a related representation

    fertilizer application Fertilizers rich in phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen
    are added to soil to increase crop yields. However, agronomic nutrient recommendations
    are often far in excess of environmental levels (Mueller et al., 1996). Therefore,
    application of nutrients contained in manures and artificial fertilizers often
    remain in the soil or are leached into the drainage water (Vanlauwe et al., 2001,
    McKergow et al., 2003). Enrichment of water because of nutrients, termed as eutrophication
    (Nixon, 1995), can give rise to toxic algal blooms which contaminates drinking
    water and harms aquatic life (Smith and Schindler, 2009, Min and Jiao, 2002).
    This acknowledges the need for a mechanism to monitor and assess nutrient inputs
    to crops, its uptake by crops and losses through runoffs and leaching from farms.
    2.2. Poor water management Irrigation techniques such as surface flooding, localised
    drip and subsurface irrigation might be efficient in some ways but they can lead
    to various problems. Under-irrigation, in the case of drip irrigation, can lead
    to salt buildup on the soil surface and can damage crops. Over-irrigation, in
    the case of surface irrigation, may not only trigger nutrient/chemical runoff,
    but can also cause perched water tables resulting in soil salinity problems (McKergow
    et al., 2003). Furthermore due to scarce water resources, low quality water is
    being increasingly used for irrigation, which is rich in nutrients and salts (Pereira
    et al., 2002). This increases the risk of salt accumulation in the root zone and
    consequent long term damage to crop production and soil fertility (Pitman and
    Läuchli, 2004, Tedeschi and Dell’Aquila, 2005). This acknowledges the need for
    an intelligent water management methodology to avoid wastage of water and allow
    its reutilisation. 2.3. Inadequately managed animal farming operations Manure
    run-off due to rainfall or poorly managed animal farming operations may carry
    pathogens like bacteria and viruses to water bodies, affecting water quality for
    both aquatic life and humans (Lipp et al., 2001, Ferguson et al., 2003). Pathogenic
    micro-organisms are responsible for causing infectious diseases in humans and,
    are a major cause of decline and destruction of coral reefs worldwide (Bellwood
    et al., 2004, EPA, 2012). In order to maintain and improve animal health within
    animal feeding operations (AFOs) facilities and to prevent any pathogen and chemical
    fluxes through fecal discharges from them, it is very important to continuously
    monitor and control the local environment. 2.4. Use of pesticides and herbicides
    Pesticide and herbicide applications on crops contribute to chemical deposits
    in soil, which are carried through runoff and leaching into rivers, lakes and
    groundwater (Cerejeira et al., 2003, Guzzella et al., 2006). Antibiotics are fed
    to livestock as growth enhancers, and manure containing these pharmaceuticals
    is spread on land, from where it leaches into ground water and reservoirs (Daughton,
    2004, Reynolds, 2003). This validates a need for: (i) monitoring microclimate
    of crops to prevent onset of moulds and other diseases, and (ii) a mechanism to
    control chemical laden water into or out of a farm preventing contamination of
    its own or other’s farm or water bodies. 3. Existing water quality data acquisition
    methods This chapter focuses on the major sampling methods which have been used
    to acquire water quality data to assess surface (rivers, lakes, dams) and ground
    water (reservoirs, aquifers) bodies. Also, this information has been used to model
    the relationship between land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Lemos et al., 2007, Shrestha et al., 2008). This chapter
    briefly discusses grab sampling, in situ sampling using data loggers, and remote
    sensing using satellite imaging, while it focuses mainly on the use of WSNs. This
    chapter discusses the suitability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and argues
    how it overcomes the limitations of the other methods. For decades, field measurements
    for water quality evaluation have depended upon costly time- and labour-intensive
    on-site sampling and data collection. Water samples are collected from the field
    and are then analysed in laboratories. This not only give limited point measurements
    but also become an expensive method for remote sites (Glasgow et al., 2004). Additionally,
    transportation of samples may disturb their chemical properties (EPA, PacifiCorp,
    2002). As data utility is affected in grab sampling by extended holding times
    before analysis, monitoring programs have shifted towards continuous measurements
    using in situ sensors (Lemos et al., 2007) Initially data loggers were used for
    in situ monitoring; however they were limited by not providing data in real time
    as sites had to be visited to retrieve data. The expense of data loggers, infield
    reliability, calibration requirements and the need to extract data from them individually,
    prevent them from being used for a dense and long term deployment of sensors.
    Alternatively, remote sensing using optical and thermal sensors on aircrafts and
    satellites can be used to monitor water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll,
    chemicals, nutrients and temperature (Glasgow et al., 2004, Webster and Grossman,
    2003). High resolution remotely sensed data is correlated by empirical or analytical
    models to a water quality parameter (Ritchie et al., 2003). Examples include a
    modelling approach to estimate phytoplankton in a shallow lake using satellite
    imagery with sparsely collected ground reference data, which demonstrates temporal
    stability (Tyler et al., 2006, Matthews et al., 2010). However, this is an expensive
    solution and its application is limited to regions covered by the satellites.
    Also, data sampling frequency may be insufficient and data may not be available
    in real time (Basha and Rus, 2007). It is reasoned that sudden fluctuations in
    water quality and quantity can be monitored using high frequency continuous measurements,
    and considerable differences in measurements are observed in daily/hourly readings
    in comparison to sparse readings (O’Flynn et al., 2010, Kirchner et al., 2004).
    Advancements in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs), low-power and low-cost
    microcontrollers and radio modules enabled WSNs for environmental monitoring (Estrin
    et al., 2001), which overcame the limitations of previous expensive, and bulky
    monitoring equipment with low spatio-temporal resolution to a certain extent.
    WSNs are networks of small embedded computers referred to as sensor nodes or ‘motes’,
    spatially distributed to cooperatively monitor environment and transmit data wirelessly.
    The relatively low cost of a WSN allows in principle, the deployment of a dense
    population of nodes that can adequately represent the variability present in the
    environment. WSNs have been used for monitoring and managing farming activities
    (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and eco-hydrologic processes (Regan
    et al., 2009, Rundel et al., 2009). Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity and nitrates have been measured in the reviewed
    applications using WSNs. A basic sensor node (Fig. 2) contains units for sensing
    and actuating, data processing, RF communications and power supply management
    (Jafer et al., 2010). A node can have many different types of sensors, for example
    measuring humidity, temperature, turbidity and nitrate but it should be noted
    that the quality of the data is dependent on the quality of the sensor. The acquired
    analogue samples are converted into digital signals using an on-board analogue-to-digital
    converter. The microprocessor may collect samples over time and aggregate them
    before transmitting them through the local radio transceiver to another node or
    a data sink (also termed as a gateway). Information collected from all the nodes
    is aggregated at the data sink and transmitted to and analysed at an off-field
    control node where a decisions might be taken. This could involve sending some
    actuation signal back to the network, for instance turning on sprinklers to irrigate
    the field. Furthermore, alternative networking approaches exist where information
    is processed and used entirely within the network, without the need for a central
    control node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture.

    WSNs deployed in a catchment. 4. WSNs for water quality monitoring and management
    WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring of surface water (rivers,
    lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments. These water bodies
    receive contaminants as a result of agricultural activities up in the catchment
    (as discussed in chapter 2). Preliminary results have been fundamental in advancing
    the knowledge of contaminant trends, through spatially constrained observations.
    Most of the applications were small scale prototype deployments and were mainly
    aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous and real-time
    data availability. These applications have yet to explore the implementation and
    impact of this technology for management and control decisions, in order to minimise
    and prevent individual stakeholder’s contaminant contributions, in an autonomous
    and dynamic manner. When this happens, the loop would be closed and better management
    policies by farmers would come into place. This would require monitoring of nutrients,
    pathogens and chemical contributions of different farming activities responsible
    for water quality degradation. WSNs have been used in agricultural activities
    but not specifically for WQM. For example a number of applications have been developed
    for precision irrigation for automatic and controlled irrigation, reducing the
    chances of water wastage (runoffs which are carrier of nutrients and contaminants)
    (McCulloch et al., 2008). However, runoff coming from elsewhere (e.g. another
    farm) cannot be avoided. This runoff can be carrying nutrients. In that case,
    current precision irrigation system can be extended to use information about runoff
    to modify the irrigation and fertilizer application of its field to save water
    and fertilizer usage. Other applications of WSNs for agriculture include pest
    control and animal farming. Pest control applications which are used to monitor
    microclimate (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) of a field to prevent conditions
    such as moulds etc. have been very important for viticulture (Morais et al., 2008,
    Beckwith et al., 2004). Furthermore, precision livestock using WSNs has been used
    to: (a) maintain animal health by monitoring environment of barns (Cugnasca et
    al., 2008, Darr and Zhao, 2008) and (b) manage cow herds in a virtual moving fence
    to control pasture area (Butler et al., 2004, Nadimi et al., 2008). The following
    sections review the applications of WSNs for WQM of different environmental compartments.
    Furthermore, the potential of including WSN-controlled existing agricultural activities,
    for integrated water quality management, is presented. 4.1. Application of WSNs
    for monitoring water fluxes and quality in different environmental compartments
    These projects are discussed below with respect to the area they monitor in a
    catchment. 4.1.1. Groundwater monitoring Groundwater contamination from human
    impacts is less obvious than surface water and cleaning it is more costly and
    technically demanding (Zektser and Lorne, 2004). Once polluted it may transport
    nutrients and chemicals to coastal waters (Gallagher et al., 1996, Valiela et
    al., 1999). WSNs have been used to measure rate, quantity and direction of water
    contamination flow in two different scenarios, one being to understand prevalence
    of arsenic in Bangladesh ground water, and the other to monitor nitrate propagation
    through soils and groundwater in parts of the USA. Although sensor nodes have
    become inexpensive, the high cost of some sensors (e.g. ammonium) is a major barrier
    for dense deployment of WSNs (Ramanathan et al., 2006). In order to monitor saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers, WSN have been deployed for monitoring water quality
    in a coastal area in Australia. Preliminary data showed potential for helping
    in decision support related to placement of extraction bores for irrigation to
    avoid groundwater degradation. However, it was not possible to set up a well-connected
    radio link in this particular humid environment (Le Dinh et al., 2007). 4.1.2.
    Surface water monitoring A test deployment project, ‘Lakenet’, was undertaken
    for water quality monitoring in a eutrophic lake by University of Notre Dame (Seders
    et al., 2007). The sensor pod system, consisting of MICA2 and MDA300 sensor board
    measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH was deployed for a short term
    (10 days). The primary objective of this deployment was to test the design of
    both the pods and the network under field conditions and to examine its ability
    to collect data continuously and reliably. This project was termed successful
    on the basis of collected data which showed diurnal fluctuations. To demonstrate
    the need for availability of high temporal rate data, as a requirement of water
    framework development (WFD), a WSN project (DEPLOY) was deployed at various locations
    on a river basin in Ireland. It achieved continuous sampling of parameters including
    conductivity, pH, chlorophyll, DO and temperature. The system consists of the
    Tyndall programmable system-on-chip sensor interface and data telemetry system
    using IDS data pod, and an optimised RF section to provide up to 4 km transmission).
    Results showed fluctuations in measurements due to activities such as runoff,
    rainfall or release of water from dams in the river. This demonstrated the potential
    for catchment behavioural analysis using statistical processing and interpretation.
    However, sensor fouling and maintenance issues were raised (Regan et al., 2009,
    O’Flynn et al., 2010). Similarly, another deployment involved performance evaluation
    of a prototype network of wireless nodes (Sunspot) on a dam in Malawi, Africa
    to counter severe health threats caused by degrading water quality. Water parameters
    such as acidity (pH), DO and turbidity were measured by integrating a sensor board
    with a sensor node. These measurements were then compared with numeric standards
    to decide on the suitability of water for drinking (Zennaro et al., 2009). Another
    application intended for WQM on dams utilises a combination of satellite remote
    sensing and WSN to enable real time analysis of satellite and surface data for
    overall coverage and the continuous monitoring of water quality. A floating sensor
    platform (buoy) is developed and deployed on a dam in Cyprus which transfers water
    quality data via wireless network to a remote central database (Papoutsa et al.,
    2010). Considerable research on developing technology to enable contaminant transport
    assessment and characterising urban stream quality and algal dynamics has been
    undertaken by CENS (Centre for Embedded Sensors), UC Los Angeles (Harmon et al.,
    2009, Gilbert, 2010). This started in 2007, by developing a test-bed for salinity,
    nitrate and soil moisture control in a 30acre land by using automatic irrigation
    control (Park and Harmon, 2007). Later progress on developing nitrate sensors
    for groundwater, soils and aquatic systems was made in 2009 (Ratâko et al., 2009).
    In 2010–2011, the project continued to focus on high resolution river observations
    using integrated sensing and model-driven analysis. Sensing is focused on temperature,
    dissolved oxygen and nitrate changes in the river (Harmon et al., 2009). For monitoring
    impact of poor water quality on aquatic life, parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen, turbidity, salinity and electrical conductivity have been measured in
    various applications (He et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2010). Real time information
    about these aquaculture environmental parameters can provide the means to give
    early warning signals. In one of the applications, based on historical data, the
    system was used to forecast water quality with artificial neural networks and
    control water quality in time to reduce the threat to fish farms. The model for
    forecasting dissolved oxygen half an hour ahead was validated with experimental
    data (Zhu et al., 2010). 4.1.3. Soil–water monitoring Monitoring drainage water
    of farms enables assessment of its quality. In this application (Kim et al., 2011),
    wireless lysimeter sensing stations were used 90 cm below the soil surface to
    monitor water flux leached below root zone under an irrigated cropping system.
    Continually monitored soil–water and weather data, sensed by a distributed network
    of sensors, was wirelessly transmitted to a base station using Bluetooth, which
    was connected to a web server for broadcasting the data via the internet. This
    provided remote online access to drainage water flux and field conditions for
    the whole growing season. This was targeted at measuring volume of drainage water
    based on irrigation frequency and rainfall events for different crops. However,
    this work could be easily extended to also monitor nutrient or salt parameters
    leached out from the soil. Another important project demonstrated the potential
    of WSNs for measuring soil water content, which was shown to be helpful in controlling
    hydrologic fluxes (Bogena et al., 2010). 4.1.4. Catchment monitoring Some work
    has been reported at catchment scale for water quality monitoring. Such catchments
    include mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, and agricultural lands. These are prototype
    deployments aimed at developing the technology and algorithms for large-scale
    remote monitoring and data processing for large volumes of heterogonous data for
    water quality. These are fundamental research efforts in this domain but improvements
    can be made. To find causes and interactions of physical/chemical variability
    on rivers and estuaries, work was started by US Geological Survey on creating
    a wireless catchment in Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve in Southern California.
    It was intended for high density monitoring of the catchment encompassing mountains,
    canyons and river channels. The system was primarily focused on developing and
    testing a network of radios and routers for wireless data transmission and its
    availability on the internet. Various issues were faced due to rugged topography
    and the difficulty of obtaining line-of sight communication. Despite these challenges,
    this provided an effective way of remote monitoring and was used further for monitoring
    meteorological properties related to pollutant loadings (Cayan et al., 2003).
    Similarly, for evaluating variation of regional weather, at mountain-to-sea scale,
    on water quality/quantity, and flooding in a catchment in Hawaii, a prototype
    system to provide 3D geospatial data visualisation utilising WSN was proposed.
    The system consisted of an array of nodes consisting of water quality sensors
    (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity), weather stations,
    sensor data loggers (InteleCell), and video monitors. Preliminary results showed
    improvement over traditional sampling methods (Kido et al., 2008). The ‘SoilWeather’
    network was used in Finland for providing high temporal resolution on weather
    conditions, soil moisture and water quality (Kotamäki et al., 2009). The work
    was reported to have been used in developing a leaching model at sub catchment
    scale, including an improved hydrological model of the river, for monitoring water
    quality and nutrient retention in rivers and wetland. The network was deployed
    on a catchment covered by forests, river, lakes, and agricultural lands owned
    by private owners, who were the main users of the data. This is an important work
    highlighting data quality and processing issues with high volumes of heterogeneous
    data, received from catchment-scale observation using a single network, varying
    in content, accuracy, and spatial–temporal resolution. Additionally, maintenance
    of sensors due to such issues as bio-fouling, freezing, and rain gauge problems,
    which resulted in erroneous and missing data were viewed as major challenges in
    obtaining high data quality. 4.2. Leveraging current agricultural processes for
    water quality monitoring and management Some of the key research areas in precision
    agriculture which have received considerable attention include precision irrigation,
    pest control, viticulture and animal health monitoring (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia
    et al., 2009). Instead of taking decisions based on hypothetical average conditions,
    the real time information from these systems provides a solid basis for farmers
    to adjust strategies at any time (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). There is a potential
    of leveraging existing networked agricultural activities for their extension into
    an integrated water quality management mechanism. In this regard, current agricultural
    processes such as pest control, precision irrigation and animal farming which
    are monitored and controlled using WSN are discussed below. 4.2.1. Pest control
    To determine and prevent the onset of a fungal disease, phytophtora, in a potato
    field, a network of sensor nodes was deployed to sense humidity and temperature.
    Sensed data was sent periodically to a gateway at the edge of the field from where
    it was forwarded to a server using Wi–Fi. The accumulated field data for a day
    was then fed into a decision support system server where it was combined with
    weather forecast to determine the treatment policy each morning, rather than spraying
    pesticides based on hypothetical assumptions. This experiment, though based on
    specialised hardware, still presented many challenges for radio coverage owing
    to crop canopy effect, routing protocol, software bugs and in-field deployment
    (Langendoen et al., 2006). It has had tremendous impact on improving deployment
    and practicality issues in WSN applications (Le Dinh et al., 2007, Liang and Terzis,
    2008). Furthermore, to prevent frost, pest and mould damage in vineyards, which
    are prone to quick damage if overstressed, WSNs have been used to monitor ambient
    temperature, soil moisture and soil temperature (Morais et al., 2008, Beckwith
    et al., 2004). This information enables vineyard owners to monitor the plants
    remotely and manage priorities accordingly (Burrell et al., 2004). These pest
    control applications could be extended, to include chemical sensing, in order
    to assess chemical levels in the crops and soil after pesticides and herbicides
    applications. Information obtained through such a mechanism could then be used
    to inform on and thus potentially control chemical fluxes into water bodies. 4.2.2.
    Animal farming In order to maintain and improve animal health within animal feeding
    operations (AFOs) and to prevent its negative impact on the ecosystem, information
    related to the local environment is very important. Moreover, by having a mechanism
    to monitor and control animal herds in pasture lands, pathogen and organic additions
    to the environment may be controlled and assessed. The deployment of WSNs in many
    AFOs has enabled monitoring of parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise
    and ammonia content in the air which has allowed the management and maintenance
    of healthy environments in these facilities (Cugnasca et al., 2008, Darr and Zhao,
    2008). For managing cattle herds in pasture land, an algorithm called ‘moving
    virtual fence’ was developed. Each animal in the herd was given a smart collar
    consisting of a GPS (for determining animal’s location), a PDA, a WLAN card and
    a sound amplifier. As the animal approached a perimeter, it is presented with
    an acoustic stimulus to drive it away from crossing over a designated virtual
    boundary. By dynamically shifting fence lines, the usage of feedlots is improved.
    In addition, it reduced the overhead of installing and moving physical fences
    (Butler et al., 2004). Other work has investigated online monitoring of cattle
    presence and pasture time using WSNs to register the time animals spend in specific
    areas of the field (Nadimi et al., 2008). This information can be used to indicate
    grass quality and quantity and can also determine the right time to provide access
    to a new grass strip. These applications can be clearly extended to monitor pathogen
    levels animal waste in a barn and their fluxes to water bodies and therefore manage
    it by raising alerts. Also, by managing animal herds with a virtual fence, the
    possible situation of them contaminating water bodies or others fields can be
    avoided or reduced. 4.2.3. Precision irrigation As established in the introduction,
    potable water resources are under pressure. Therefore an efficient way of utilising
    water resources by people in general and agriculture sector in particular is crucial
    to avoiding a global water crisis (Chartres and Varma, 2011). By monitoring soil
    and environmental parameters (like soil moisture, soil temperature, ambient temperature
    and humidity), an informed decision can be made by farmers to control the timing
    and quantity of irrigation. Unlike expensive, sophisticated, high maintenance
    and high energy sensor-based technologies like Adcon Telemetry and Automata, and
    labour intensive data collection from logging stations, WSNs provide real-time
    and less expensive sensing mechanisms for improving irrigation automation (Vellidis
    et al., 2008). It is estimated that 70% of the annual water usage of the agricultural
    industry, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is used to irrigate dairy pastures.
    In order to improve water use efficiency for pasture production, data is collected
    using 70 sensor pods which were developed using off-the-shelf components for this
    experiment. Accurate irrigation at targeted dry areas can be provided by studying
    soil dynamics, using soil and environmental parameters collected from the pasture
    field. Received data showed variation in soil moisture levels with events such
    as rains etc. (McCulloch et al., 2008). Another example made a comparison between
    traditional and sensor scheduling systems in a cotton field (2.3 ha) for the whole
    growing season (Vellidis et al., 2008). The East of the field, divided into four
    different irrigation zones based on soil type and historic yield map, was equipped
    with 9 sensor nodes and centre pivot variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. On
    the western side, 3 sensor nodes were deployed to monitor soil tension, and here
    irrigation was triggered based on traditional assessment of crops. Each sensor
    node was equipped with three moisture and temperature sensors buried at 0.2, 0.4
    and 0.6 m depth under the soil. Results showed water tension at more than double
    the trigger points at 0.4 and 0.6 m depth in western zone despite irrigation,
    whereas the eastern side never surpassed the trigger points. However, it is stated
    that further work needs to be done on the VRI controller for varying quantity
    of irrigation relative to the needs of individual areas, or for different crops
    in a single field. To address such a need, site specific VRI was employed in a
    3.6 ha plot by using six in-field sensor stations. These stations were based on
    off-the-shelf components, with a plug-and-play Bluetooth radio module, and would
    periodically sample data and transmit back to the base station. Each sensing station
    was equipped with water content reflectometers, a soil temperature probe, and
    a humidity probe. The irrigation machine was controlled by a programmable logic
    controller that would update the geo-referenced location of sprinklers from a
    differential GPS, and wirelessly communicate with a computer at the base station.
    This enabled variable rate irrigation according to the needs of individual crops
    in a large field. (Kim et al., 2008). As discussed above, a significant amount
    of successful work has been published using automatic and variable rate irrigation
    with some limitations regarding reliability. However, what is lacking is the inclusion
    of real time information about events elsewhere in the farm to alter irrigation
    decisions. For example, information about possible weather changes, like rain,
    from other networks in a catchment could be used to change time and quantity of
    irrigation by allowing forward planning and prediction. Also, information regarding
    irrigation in one farm can be used elsewhere in the catchment to prohibit entry
    of nutrient flux from that runoff. 5. Research gap in water quality monitoring
    and management using WSNs The literature review for the application of WSN for
    water quality monitoring and agricultural activities presents many possibilities
    and potential, yet identifies numerous limitations. Following are the major limitations
    commonly observed in the reviewed literature. 5.1. Absence of catchment scale
    integrated monitoring and management As identified in chapter 2, a number of catchment-scale
    activities are responsible for water quality degradation. Therefore, to identify
    the individual and major impacts of the diffused pollutant sources, it is vital
    to base the monitoring system on the entire catchment. It has been acknowledged
    in the literature that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends and quantification
    of the contributing factors. WSNs have been successful in understanding the trends
    of nutrients and contaminants fluxes owing to non-point source activities in a
    catchment. However, this understanding is limited as it can currently only use
    small-scale, localised and specific measurements at rivers, lakes, dams and groundwater
    reservoirs (Ramanathan et al., 2006, Le Dinh et al., 2007, Zennaro et al., 2009,
    Papoutsa et al., 2010, Seders et al., 2007, Harmon et al., 2007, O’Flynn et al.,
    2010, Regan et al., 2009). These water resources receive contaminants as a result
    of activities up in the catchment, thus providing insufficient information for
    quantifying explicit responsible activities. Fewer applications are intended for
    large-scale observations (Kido et al., 2008, Kotamäki et al., 2009, Cayan et al.,
    2003), but these are prototype deployments based on limited monitoring points
    across the catchment. A major step in this direction is the new network of terrestrial
    environmental observatories in Germany that provides real-time access to instruments
    in a multi-scale and multi-temporal mode for the monitoring of relevant fluxes
    of trace-gases, water and matter in all important environmental compartments at
    the catchment-scale, e.g. hydrological sensor networks, micrometeorological flux
    stations and clusters of lysimeters (Zacharias et al., 2011). Existing work does
    not implement multi-scale monitoring mechanisms that include all stakeholders
    in a catchment, to assess their individual contributions, which is fundamental
    for the understanding of cumulative impacts on water quality degradation. Current
    projects are focused on the development and deployment of the required infrastructure
    for enabling high-temporal, real-time water-quality observations to be made available
    through GSM or internet on a central data repository (Kotamäki et al., 2009, Kido
    et al., 2008). These do not include addressing management and control decisions,
    to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Thus a need can be identified for an autonomous
    and integrated catchment-scale monitoring mechanism, based on targeted wireless
    sensor technologies. 5.2. Absence of suitable sensors Water quality analysis requires
    monitoring of various parameters as represented in the tabulated contaminant constituents
    (Table 1). It is apparent that the advances in sensor development have not kept
    pace with the advances in potential sensor materials (Zhuiykov, 2012). The development
    of sensors from new materials to enable solid-state and film-based sensors requires
    significant development effort before they can be used in real applications, although
    they do offer significant potential. An example of an improved sensor is the development
    of a solid-state water quality sensor with metal oxide sensing electrodes under
    research efforts by Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
    This has provided the capability to measure pH, DO and dissolved metal ions in
    a way more appropriate for WSN applications (Zhuiykov, 2007, Zhuiykov, 2012).
    It is evident through the surveyed literature that existing work does not include
    all of the contaminants and parameters required for water quality monitoring,
    for example phosphorous, nitrates, and ammonia. This is because suitable in situ
    phosphate and nitrate sensors for terrestrial deployment are not available. The
    available sensors for nitrate monitoring are based on ultraviolet absorption and
    flow cell analysers which are very expensive for dense deployment (Robertson et
    al., 2009). Both electromechanical (Bobacka et al., 2008) and optical sensing
    modes (McDonagh et al., 2008) relevant to nitrogen and phosphorous species are
    still an active research area (Rundel et al., 2009). Furthermore, research on
    the development of miniature, reliable and inexpensive water quality solid-state
    sensors using metal oxide sensing electrodes is underway by CSIRO, CMSE and SSN
    TCP laboratories (Zhuiykov, 2012). In the absence of affordable and reliable in
    situ sensors for all of the necessary water quality parameters, estimation of
    constituent fluxes in streams and rivers relies on surrogate sensors which give
    proxy measurements. Examples include use of turbidity (clarity of water) and fluorescence
    intensities as a surrogate for suspended sediments and biochemical oxygen demand
    (Minella et al., 2008, Hudson et al., 2008). Another study demonstrated successful
    surrogate relationship, for road and roof surfaces, of dissolved total nitrates
    and total phosphates with total dissolved solids (TDSs). For measuring TDS, electrical
    conductivity was used as a surrogate (Miguntanna, 2009). These surrogates have
    been fundamental in advancing our knowledge about the trends in the actual parameters.
    However it is also noted that measurement error and uncertainty in the derived
    surrogate relationships can have a substantial effect on the uncertainty of flux
    estimates made using surrogates (Horsburgh et al., 2010) and require significant
    calibration of the environments in which they are deployed. Although sensor development
    is on-going (Zhuiykov, 2012), there are still few useable sensors for many of
    the parameters, thus it can be concluded that there is a requirement for accurate,
    inexpensive, low-power, long-lived, robust and miniature sensors for effective
    water quality analysis. 5.3. Issues related to the use of off-the-shelf components
    Current applications of WSNs for WQM are based on the use of off-the-shelf components
    which often fail to address the diverse range of environmental and degradation
    problems that can coalesce at catchment scales. Existing devices are not made
    to address the specific requirements of a particular application. Various limitations,
    as discussed above, have been faced in the existing literature by the use of off
    the shelf components (Le Dinh et al., 2007) such as the coverage problem (Regan
    et al., 2009), signal attenuation (Vellidis et al., 2008), configuration and operational
    difficulties (Trubilowicz et al., 2009), and absence of a network model for catchment
    areas with hilly terrains which has the potential to affect the radio links. Standards
    for WSNs were developed primarily for urban monitoring situations such as buildings
    and industries. However, they are less suited to remote and large scale applications
    such as agriculture with coverage and crop canopy problems due to the propagation
    environment and typical range requirements. For example, high frequency systems
    (typically 2.4 GHz) commonly rely on line-of-sight systems and physical obstructions
    such as plants, or conditions such as rain, can significantly reduce the communication
    range to as little as a few metres. Furthermore, these frequencies are unsuitable
    for underground WSNs, which are ideal for non-invasive soil monitoring, as they
    suffer data losses due to soil water content (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Li
    et al., 2007). In an experiment, sensor and link failures were handled by: (1)
    identifying patterns in data to indicate sensor failure and (2) using decision
    trees based on data flow models to identify link failure (Ramanathan et al., 2006).
    Top level concepts and protocols are applicable without any changes but care is
    needed for practical deployment and it may be that certain applications require
    a significant rethink of the communication requirements, which may not be addressed
    by current off-the-shelf solutions. This is an on-going research for the application
    of underground wireless sensor networks. (Bogena et al., 2009) evaluated signal
    attenuation by factors like soil depth, soil water content and soil electrical
    conductivity. They concluded that in a hybrid underground approach, which combines
    below ground and above ground data transmission, sufficient power will remain
    to ensure long distant data communication. As long term and spatiotemporal monitoring
    is required for effective analysis of water degradation trends in a catchment,
    a low cost, low power and reliable system is required. Existing literature has
    shown that many nodes lasted from only a few days to months, therefore effective
    design changes like wake up and power control need to be considered to prolong
    their lifetime to years. Furthermore, although separate sensor boards (Zennaro
    et al., 2009, O’Flynn et al., 2007) can be integrated with nodes to enable a multi
    sensing system with various sensor types, improvements can be made to take this
    further. The plug and play system constrains sensors to be compatible with that
    system, whereas a more reconfigurable interface may well extend the choice of
    sensors at the expense of some complexity in specifying to the host node what
    the sensor requires in terms of resources. Therefore, there is a requirement for
    a reconfigurable sensor interface for a sensor node, e.g. SDI-12, as this would
    allow a more rapid deployment for a specific application and thereby reducing
    the costs of the WSNs. In addition, various deployment and maintenance issues
    were faced due to the placement of sensors in soil and water. Bio-fouling of sensors
    deployed in water required regular cleaning and maintenance (Regan et al., 2009).
    6. A case for collaborative WSNs for integrated catchment-scale water quality
    management Through the review of related work and its limitations, it is established
    that for effective water quality management at a catchment scale, a system of
    individually networked activities needs to be included into an integrated monitoring
    system. Information sharing of critical parameters between networked environmental
    compartments and WSN-controlled agricultural activities can enable identification
    and quantification of the contributing factors in water degradation. This would
    further address management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual
    stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions, on waterways as well as on other
    stakeholders, in an autonomous and dynamic manner (Zia et al., 2013). Fig. 4 illustrates
    information sharing among individual networks in a catchment. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated
    WSNs. It is proposed that monitoring should be based on three levels covering
    the micro-to macro- scales. Micro-scale monitoring is aimed at improved understanding
    of small scale processes such as leaching of nutrients in soil and groundwater
    and retention of fertilizers by soil. Then a medium scale monitoring which is
    focused on assessing agricultural practices such as improved irrigation strategies,
    and use of alternative fertilizers or reduced application rates while maintaining
    same crop yields. Finally, macro-scale monitoring considers catchment level, sub-catchment
    level and regional land use assessments. Monitoring environmental compartments
    continuously and spatially can identify specific local sources for nutrient/contaminant
    fluxes (e.g. a barn or a farm). If this information is fed back to the identified
    stakeholder in real time, there is the potential to control or minimise the fluxes
    emanating from the location. If there are other networks monitoring nutrient/contaminant
    levels and fluxes near the source location, then the information provided by these
    networks can be correlated with data from the original monitoring point. If it
    correlates well then this has identified a route from the source to the appropriate
    nearby network as well as characterising that route in terms of quantity and time
    constant, thus allowing a model of cause and effect to be built up for the locality.
    Based on this information, the responsible stakeholder can then assess its adopted
    practices and alter strategies to reduce its contribution to water quality degradation.
    A collaborative control and management strategy requires that individually targeted
    monitoring units or local networks, representing different stakeholders in a catchment
    e.g. a farm, should be able to share information with each other about runoffs,
    contaminants or nutrient fluxes. These events may be intense but are short-lived
    and so information sharing becomes important as they may be very fast compared
    with the usual sampling rate, and so may normally be missed. Allowing event information
    to be transmitted across multiple networks as they are detected will allow prediction
    of when the repercussions of that event might be seen downstream, allowing other
    stakeholder networks in the vicinity to adjust their monitoring strategy to improve
    the value of information e.g. by increasing their sample rate to catch transient
    events. This would than support the development of advanced models that are able
    to simulate catchment processes in a more detailed way. Implementing such a mechanism
    allows every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through
    the catchment from other networks. 7. Conclusion This paper has reviewed the potential
    impact of agricultural activities on water quality degradation in a catchment.
    It has proposed that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends, their
    quantification and management of the contributing factors. This identifies a need
    for an autonomous and collaborative mechanism, based on targeted wireless sensor
    technologies. Furthermore, it is concluded that for effective and integrated water
    quality monitoring and management at a catchment scale, a system of individually
    networked activities is needed. This is likely to take the form of a combination
    of networks that have been installed for local monitoring purposes (e.g. at farm
    scale, primarily to provide local information for that farm), and some specific
    networks aimed at filling in information gaps in the catchment. This system of
    networks should be able to share information about critical parameters for events,
    such as rain, or floods, that could trigger consequences, such as contaminants
    runoff and so requires a higher level application to make use of this information,
    and also requires the individual networks to be aware that similar networks nearby
    are capable of passing information to them. This will inevitably lead to some
    form of standardisation of communication protocol and data representation between
    enabled environmental networks. Applications of WSNs for water quality monitoring
    and management for a catchment hold huge potential. However, certain limitations
    have been identified in this review such as small scale, single application deployments,
    limitations of off-the-shelf components, the lack of suitable sensors and the
    cost of deployment and data collection. Furthermore, it is determined that important
    application specific requirements are not well catered for by using off-the-shelf
    components such as variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible sensor interfaces,
    lifetime, ease of deployment and configuration for hydrologists, and a network
    model for the broader environment. Hence, it is emphasized that although there
    is continual and improving design of sensor nodes for individual applications
    there is still a requirement for more flexibility in node design with a view to
    allowing networks to successfully interact with each other. In the absence of
    affordable and reliable in situ sensors for WQM, measurements rely on surrogate
    sensors which give proxy measurements. Therefore, it is concluded that there is
    still a need for accurate, inexpensive and miniature sensors with a long field
    life for WQM. Nevertheless, developments on all these areas are on-going, and
    as such deficiencies are addressed, the ability to monitor at catchment scales
    will improve. We argue that by implementing a collaborative mechanism that allows
    every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through the
    networks, the overall value of that information will be increased. References

    representing the water quality of rivers and I index representing the water quality
    of the lake through point source and nonpoint source pollution. Rapidly increasing
    fertilizer and pesticide utilization cause agricultural nonpoint source pollution
    to become increasingly problematic (Yang et al., 2019; Zia et al., 2013). Untreated
    discharged industrial wastewater has a major impact on water quality (Di et al.,

  title: 'The impact of agricultural activities on water quality: A case for collaborative
    catchment-scale management using integrated wireless sensor networks'
  verbatim_quote1: A diagrammatic representation of the major activities responsible
    for the degradation of water on a catchment scale owing to point and non-point
    sources is shown in Fig. 1.
  verbatim_quote2: It is apparent through the surveyed literature that existing work
    does not include all of the contaminants and parameters required for water quality
    monitoring, for example phosphorous, nitrates, and ammonia.

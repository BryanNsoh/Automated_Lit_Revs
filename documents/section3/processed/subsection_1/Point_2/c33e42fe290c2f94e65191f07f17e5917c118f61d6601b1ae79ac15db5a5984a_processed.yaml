  analysis: The paper comprehensively analyses the research findings on the use of
    IoT in agriculture and farming by using 60 recent scientific articles. It identifies
    water management as the most researched sub-vertical for the last few years as
    most countries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources due to its lack
    of abundance. The second-most considered sub-vertical is crop management due to
    the importance of producing food for a growing global population. It further discusses
    the significance of using Wi-Fi and mobile technology in IoT-based agriculture
    and farming and provides insights into the research gaps and future directions
    in the field.

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\

    "In this paper, we employ artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic (FL),
    and genetic algorithms (GA) to improve upon or replace traditional physically-based
    models for prediction of runoff in an agricultural watershed. Specifically, we
    compare the output of our data-driven models with that of a physically-based model,
    SWAT. The results show that our data-driven models are able to achieve comparable
    accuracy to the physically-based model, while being significantly less computationally
    expensive. This suggests that data-driven models may be a valuable tool for real-time
    irrigation management in the future."'

    \ use of stochastic-based methods, distributed versus lumped pa-\nrameter techniques,\
    \ influence of data resolution and scalar issues, and the utilization of artificial\
    \ intelligence (AI) as part \nof a data-driven approach to assist in watershed\
    \ modeling efforts. Important findings and observed trends from this work \ninclude\
    \ (i) use of AI techniques artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL),\
    \ and genetic algorithms (GA) to im-\nprove upon or replace traditional physically-based\
    \ techniques which tend to be computationally expensive; (ii) limitations \nin\
    \ scale-up of hydrological processes for watershed modeling; and (iii) the impacts\

    \ wide variety of systems currently available \nfor watershed management at multiple\
    \ scales. A summary of these discussions is presented in tabular format for use\
    \ by \nwater resource managers and decision makers as a screening tool for selecting\

    \ water resources, hydrology, catchments. \nINTRODUCTION \nGlobal advances in\
    \ economies and standards of living \nhave resulted in a growing dependency on\
    \ water resources. \nMany societies have experienced water scarcity as a result\
    \ of \ncurrent patterns with societal advances; these are associated \nwith factors\
    \ such as population growth, increased urbaniza-\ntion and industrialization,\
    \ increased energy use, increased \nirrigation associated with advances in agriculture\
    \ productiv-\nity, desertification, global warming, and poor water quality \n\
    [1-4]. Improved understanding of how each of these factors \ninfluences water\
    \ supply, demand, and quality require im-\nproved abilities to understand underlying\
    \ processes and their \nimpact on water availability and use. This entails employing\
    \ \na holistic approach which integrates hydrologic processes at \nthe watershed\
    \ scale to determine an overall watershed re-\nsponse to both user demands and\
    \ changing climates [1]. Cen-\ntral to this effort, watershed modeling is being\
    \ utilized as a \ntool to better understand surface and subsurface water \nmovement\
    \ and the interactions between these water bodies. \nMore importantly, they offer\
    \ tools to guide decision making \non water resources, water quality, and related\
    \ hazard issues \n[2]. \nThis paper begins with a brief overview of the regulatory\
    \ \ncontext for the use of a watershed-based approach. An ex-\namination of various\
    \ watershed modeling methods, key \nprocesses involved, and new modeling techniques\
    \ are then  \n \n \n*Address correspondence to this author at the Vanderbilt University,\

    WATERSHED \nAP-\nPROACH \nUnderstanding and managing water resource problems \n\
    involve complex processes and interactions at the surface, \nsubsurface, and their\
    \ interface. In an effort to account for \nmany of these interactions and the\
    \ impacts on drinking water \nsources, water quality regulations are focusing\
    \ on more ho-\nlistic approaches for analysis and maintenance of water re-\nsources.\
    \ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n2006 – 2011 Strategic Planmaintains\
    \ the five goals that were \ndescribed in the 2003 - 2008 Strategic Plan: (i)\
    \ clean air and \nglobal climate change; (ii) clean and safe water; (iii) land\
    \ \npreservation and restoration; (iv) healthy communities and \necosystems; \n\
    and \n(v) \ncompliance \nand \nenvironmental \nstewardship [3]. The Strategic\
    \ Plan calls for improved stan-\ndards, protection of source waters, security\
    \ of water infra-\nstructure, and improved quality of rivers, lakes, and streams.\
    \ \nThe new plan provides increased focus on achieving more \nmeasurable, environmentally-relevant\
    \ results, including use \nof a watershed-based perspective. Sub-Objective 2.2.1:\
    \ \nImprove Water Quality on a Watershed Basis, outlines \nUSEPA’s plan to “work\

    \ and others in three key areas: \nmaintaining strong core programs that emphasize\
    \ watershed \nprotection...” [3]. In addition, at both federal and state levels,\
    \ \nincreased regulations of Total Maximum Daily Loads \n(TMDLs) of the watershed-wide\
    \ pollutant influx to a water \nbody, typically referenced as non-point source\
    \ pollution, has \ncreated strong demand for new assessment tools that take \n\
    into consideration multiple sources of flow (e.g., overland \nflow) [4]. Several\
    \ watershed-scale models have been devel-\noped that provide assistance in predicting\
    \ non-point source \npollution. Borah and Bera [5] provide a detailed summary\
    \ of \nmany of these including the Agricultural Non-Point Source \nPollution Model\
    \ (AGNPS), Areal Non-Point Source Water-\nshed Environment Simulation (ANSWERS),\
    \ Kinematic \nRunoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS), Hydrological \nSimulation Program-FORTRAN\
    \ (HSPF), MIKE SHE, Soil \nand Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and others; therefore,\
    \ \nthey are only briefly considered in this review.  \nWATERSHED MODELING  \n\
    A watershed model simulates hydrologic processes in a \nmore holistic approach\
    \ compared to many other models \nwhich primarily focus on individual processes\
    \ or multiple \nprocesses at relatively small-or field-scale without full incor-\n\
    poration of a watershed area [6]. Watershed-scale modeling \nhas emerged as an\
    \ important scientific research and man-\nagement tool, particularly in efforts\
    \ to understand and con-\ntrol water pollution [7-11]. In the subsequent section,\
    \ differ-\nent types of watershed models are discussed along with sug-\ngested\
    \ applications. In addition, the role of artificial intelli-\ngence in assisting\
    \ in watershed modeling is discussed in \nsome detail. Genetic algorithms (GAs),\
    \ artificial neural net-\nworks (ANN), and fuzzy logic (FL) are currently being\
    \ em-\nployed to assist in processing data, develop improved rela-\ntionships\
    \ between hydrologic processes, and in some cases, \nassist in filling voids in\
    \ measured data. While much work \nhas been done to model individual hydrological\
    \ processes, \ncombining these processes at a much larger, watershed-scale \n\
    requires additional expertise and data resources. A short dis-\ncussion on the\
    \ difficulties encountered and some solutions \nused in scaling-up to the watershed\
    \ level is provided, includ-\ning discussions on data resolution, over parameterization,\
    \ \nand the impacts of digital elevation model (DEM) mesh size \non model accuracy.\
    \  \nModel Types \nWatershed models can be grouped into various categories \n\
    based upon the modelling approaches used. Melone et al. [7] \nnote the primary\
    \ features for distinguishing watershed-scale \nmodelling approaches include the\
    \ nature of the employed \nalgorithms (empirical, conceptual, or physically-based),\
    \ \nwhether a stochastic or deterministic approach is used for \nmodel input or\
    \ parameter specification, and whether the spa-\ntial representation is lumped\
    \ or distributed. Each of these \nfeatures is briefly outlined below in order\
    \ to provide context \nto subsequent watershed-scale modelling approaches. \n\
    Empirical models consist of functions used to approxi-\nmate or fit available\
    \ data. Such models span arange of com-\nplexity, from simple regression models\
    \ [8-10] to hydroin-\nformatics-based models which utilize Artificial Neural Net-\n\
    works (ANNs), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic, and other algorithms \n[11-19]. Additional\
    \ discussion on use of artificial intelli-\ngence in empirical watershed modelling\
    \ is provided in sub-\nsequent sections of this work. \nWatershed models can be\
    \ categorized as deterministic or \nstochastic depending on the techniques involved\
    \ in the mod-\nelling process. Deterministic models are mathematical mod-\nels\
    \ in which outcomes are obtained through known relation-\nships among states and\
    \ events. Stochastic models will have \nmost, if not all, of their inputs or parameters\
    \ represented by \nstatistical distributions which determine a range of outputs\
    \ \n[7]. Even though most models are deterministic in nature, \nstochastic models\
    \ provide two important advantages. First, \ntheir conceptually simple framework\
    \ makes it possible to \ndescribe heterogeneity when there are limited spatial\
    \ or tem-\nporal details. Second, they provide decision makers with the \nability\
    \ to determine uncertainty associated with predictions \n[7, 20-26].  \nWatershed-scale\
    \ models can further be categorized on a \nspatial basis as lumped, semi-distributed,\
    \ or distributed mod-\nels. The lumped modeling approach considers a watershed\
    \ as \na single unit for computations where the watershed parame-\nters and variables\
    \ are averaged over this unit. Compared to \nlumped models, semi-distributed and\
    \ distributed models ac-\ncount for the spatial variability of hydrologic processes,\
    \ in-\nput, boundary conditions, and watershed characteristics [4, \n27]. For\
    \ semi-distributed models, the aforementioned quanti-\nties are partially allowed\
    \ to vary in space by dividing the \nbasin into a number of smaller sub-basins\
    \ which in turn are \ntreated as a single unit [7, 28, 29]. Spatial heterogeneity\
    \ in \ndistributed models is represented with a resolution typically \ndefined\
    \ by the modeller [7]. Physically-based models are \nbased on the understanding\
    \ of the physics associated with the \nhydrological processes which control catchment\
    \ response \nand utilize physically based equations to describe these proc-\n\
    esses [30]. Examples of widely accepted physically based \nmodels on the market\
    \ include GSSHA [31, 32], HSPF, \nKINEROS2 [33], MIKE SHE [34], and SWAT [35,\
    \ 36]. \nDiscussion on the impacts of spatial data resolution and scal-\ning issues\
    \ in watershed modelling is provided later in this \ndocument. \nWatershed-scale\
    \ models can be further subdivided into \nevent-based or continuous-process models.\
    \ Event-based \nmodels simulate individual precipitation-runoff events with a\
    \ \nfocus on infiltration and surface runoff, while continuous-\nprocess models\
    \ explicitly account for all runoff components \nwhile considering soil moisture\
    \ redistribution between storm \nevents [7]. Further discussions of the aforementioned\
    \ classi-\nfication and watershed modeling approaches are presented in \nBorah\
    \ and Bera [5], Kalin and Hantush [37], Refsgaard [27], \nSingh and Frevert [38],\
    \ and Singh and Woolhiser [39]. \nAdvances inPhysically-based Models \nIn physically-based\
    \ models, mass transfer, momentum, \nand energy are simulated using partial differential\
    \ equations \nwhich are solved by various numerical methods such as the \nSt.\
    \ Venant equations [40] for surface flow, Richards [41] \nequation for unsaturated\
    \ zone flow, Penman-Monteith [42] \nequation for evapotranspiration and Boussinesq\
    \ equation for \nground water flow. Typically, the data and computation re-\n\
    quirements for these equations are enormous and demanding. \nFor example, the\
    \ traditional inversion methods using re-\npeated model runs are computationally\
    \ intensive and are not \n28    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \n\
    Daniel et al. \nappropriate for operational application for regional and \nglobal\
    \ data [43]. Significant effort has gone into addressing \nthese data and computational\
    \ issues.  \nIn a review of current projects in the United States, Re-\nstrepo\
    \ and Schaake [44] note that emphasis is being placed \non models with parameters\
    \ that can be derived from physical \nwatershed characteristics. However, it was\
    \ also noted that \npurely physically-based models may be unattainable or im-\n\
    practical, and, therefore, models resulting from a combina-\ntion of physically\
    \ and conceptually approached processes \nmay be required. Restrepo and Schaake\
    \ [44] further suggest \nthat the future needs and directions of research for\
    \ hydro-\nlogic modeling include: \n(1) Reliable modeling of the different sources\
    \ of uncer-\ntainty; \n(2) A more expeditious and cost-effective approach by \n\
    reducing the effort required in model calibration;  \n(3) Improvements in forecast\
    \ lead-time and accuracy;  \n(4) An approach for rapid adjustment of model parame-\n\
    ters to account for changes in the watershed, both \nrapid as the result from\
    \ forest fires or levee \nbreaches, and slow, as the result of watershed refor-\n\
    estation, reforestation or urban development; and  \n(5) An expanded suite of\
    \ products, including soil mois-\nture and temperature forecasts, and water quality\
    \ \nconstituents. \nRestrepo and Schaake [44] also emphasize the develop-\nment\
    \ of improved precipitation estimation techniques such as \nstatistical merging\
    \ of remote-sensor observations and fore-\ncasts from high-resolution numerical\
    \ prediction models. \nBeckers et al. [45] reviewed many of the widely used hydro-\n\
    logic models and suggest one key area for computational \nimprovement is the need\
    \ to better quantify climate change \nwhich include possible future shifts in\
    \ temperature and pre-\ncipitation, the occurrence of extreme events, and the\
    \ changes \nin glacier mass balances. Central to this research is under-\nstanding\
    \ how best to link hydrologic models to climate \nchange predictions which present\
    \ downscaling issues which \nare well documented by Wood et al., [46], Merritt\
    \ et al., [47] \nand Stahl et al., [48]. Climate change projections are gener-\n\
    ated from global-scale, general circulation models which are \ntoo coarse for\
    \ hydrologic models and some level of statistical \ndownscaling will be required\
    \ [49]. Four recent statistical \ndownscaling techniques that have been applied\
    \ with some \nsuccess in western North America include the delta method \n[50],\
    \ ClimateBC [51], Bias-correction statistical downscaling \n[52-54] and the Tree-GEN\
    \ method [48].  \nAn essential component of each physically-based model \nis the\
    \ availability of sufficient data to represent each of the \nmodeled processes.\
    \ Significant advances to improve data \ngeneration, preparation, and management\
    \ are being realized \nthrough the utilization of geospatial technologies such\
    \ as \ngeographic information system (GIS), global positioning \nsystems (GPS),\
    \ and remote sensing. Typical model prepara-\ntion tasks include the use of remotely\
    \ sensed images for ex-\ntraction of the terrain canopy data or the use of a digital\
    \ ter-\nrain model (DTM), or digital elevation model (DEM) data \nfor extraction\
    \ of hydrologic catchment properties, such as \nelevation matrix, flow direction\
    \ matrix, ranked elevation \nmatrix, and flow accumulation matrix. Notable GIS-based\
    \ \nextraction tools include MapWindowsTauDEM (Terrain \nAnalysis Using Digital\
    \ Elevation Models) [55], GIS Weasel \n(An Interface for the Development of Spatial\
    \ Parameters for \nPhysical Process Modeling) [56], and ArcHydro [57]. Recent\
    \ \nwork by Prodanovi\x03 et al. [58] utilized DEM-based GIS al-\ngorithms to\
    \ improve DEM data accuracy and usability. \nWhen digital data is employed for\
    \ hydrological modeling, \nthey offer the following data evaluation procedures\
    \ to im-\nprove accuracy and usability: (i) check the fraction of the \narea that\
    \ has the slope of 0%; (ii) use of the surface flow \nrouting tool (can be found\
    \ in most GIS packages) in order to \ncheck whether water will flow across the\
    \ whole study area if \narbitrary source point is selected; (iii) check of the\
    \ orienta-\ntion and interconnection of the stream network; and (iv) use \nof\
    \ streams as “cut-outs” across the DEM and check whether \nthe slope of a longitudinal\
    \ section toward the lowest, exit \nnode, is continuous. \nIn many instances,\
    \ limited or no data is available for \nstudied watersheds. GIS automated tools\
    \ based on geostatis-\ntics interpolation techniques (e.g., inverse distance weight-\n\
    ing, splines, and kriging) offer improved options for generat-\ning new DEMs datasets\
    \ from point and contour datasets. \nRecent studies (e.g., Flipo et al., [59];\
    \ Frei, et al., [60], San-\ntini, et al., [61]) continue to improve these techniques.\
    \ Flipo \net al., [59] demonstrated kriging provides a satisfactory rep-\nresentation\
    \ of aquifer nitrate contamination from local ob-\nservations to set initial conditions\
    \ for the physically-based \nmodel. It was further noted that the use of geostatistics\
    \ and \nphysically-based modeling allows assessment of nitrate con-\ncentrations\
    \ in aquifer systems. Frei et al., [60] also utilized \nthe same method in a parallel\
    \ physically-based surface–\nsubsurface model to investigate the spatial patterns\
    \ and tem-\nporal dynamics of river–aquifer exchange in a heterogeneous \nalluvial\
    \ river–aquifer system with deep water table. Tague \nand Pohl-Costello [62] also\
    \ examined how flow data from a \nsimilar watershed can serve to compensate for\
    \ this data limi-\ntation in the context of understanding impacts on hydrologic\
    \ \nbehavior. \nModel Parameter Estimation and Calibration \nParameter estimation\
    \ and calibration of hydrologic mod-\nels inherently possess significant challenges\
    \ associated with \nthe nature of most hydrologic models; namely (i) nonlinear-\n\
    ity; (ii) data errors; (iii) data insufficiency; (iv) correlation \namong parameters;\
    \ (v) irregular response surfaces that may \nbe insensitive to select model parameters;\
    \ and (vi) single or \nmulti-objective nature of the models [63]. Parameter estima-\n\
    tion techniques often further attempt to quantify uncertainty \nof these estimates\
    \ and may be divided into two primary ap-\nproaches: (i) Bayesian; and (ii) frequentist\
    \ [64]. Bayesian \nmethods treat model parameters as random variables that \n\
    possesses probability distributions that are iteratively refined \nby comparing\
    \ measured data with model outputs based on \nselection of different model parameters\
    \ derived from an ini-\ntial, best estimate, distribution [64]. In contrast, frequentist\
    \ \napproaches model parameters as fixed entities that are then \nadjusted through\
    \ comparison with a calibration data set \nthrough various means [64], including\
    \ (i) a priori estima-\ntions; (ii) curve fitting (including trial and error calibration,\
    \ \nmethod of moments, least squares, maximum likelihood, and \nlinear and nonlinear\
    \ regression); and (iii) combination meth-\nWatershed Modeling and its Applications\
    \ \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    29 \nods [63, 65]. Numerous earlier\
    \ and more recent reviews out-\nline parameter estimation, calibration, and uncertainty\
    \ analy-\nsis as applied to hydrologic models (e.g., [65-87]). As noted \nby McDonnell\
    \ et al. [88], improved predictions for ungauged \nbasins is critical for overall\
    \ advancement in watershed hy-\ndrologic modeling. So here we focus briefly on\
    \ select recent \nadvances employed where data is especially sparse, such as \n\
    in ungauged basins.  \nModel parameter estimation and calibration processes are\
    \ \nespecially challenging for ungauged basins, where sparse or \npoor data quality\
    \ often favor the use of empirical versus \nphysically-based models [89]. Recent\
    \ advances include use \nof a hydrological distributed model, linking GIS with\
    \ system \ndynamics, employing linear, nonlinear, and Markov Chain \nMonte Carlo\
    \ (MCMC) uncertainly analyses, and use of areal \nevapotranspiration in lieu of\
    \ stream flow. Velez et al. [90] \nemployed the conceptual, distributed runoff\
    \ model, TETIS, \nwith a parameter estimation methodology, generating a cor-\n\
    rection function that compared model parameter values at \nindividual model section\
    \ scale to overall watershed charac-\nteristics derived from available data, taking\
    \ into account spa-\ntial and temporal scale effects enabling reduction in the\
    \ \nnumber of parameters requiring calibration. Aragon et al. \n[91] explored\
    \ the modeling of ungauged tributaries through \nuse of GIS to model hydrological\
    \ response units and a sys-\ntem dynamics model to represent physical processes.\
    \ Here, \nGIS was used to convert time series outputs from the process \nmodels\
    \ to spatial representations, which then formed the \nbasis for estimating parameter\
    \ inputs to subsequent model \nruns. Although the system reflected reasonable\
    \ behaviors, \nthe model was not calibrated [91]. Gallagher and Doherty \n[64]\
    \ examined the performance of three separate parameter \nestimation and uncertainly\
    \ analysis methods employed in a \nlumped parameter surface flow model Hydrological\
    \ Simula-\ntion Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) [64]. Both linear and non-\nlinear uncertainly\
    \ methods provided relative parameter un-\ncertainty assessment and understanding\
    \ degree of correlation \nbetween model parameters, but both were limited in predic-\n\
    tive uncertainty. MCMC proved especially useful in provid-\ning qualitative information\
    \ on parameter probability distribu-\ntions, but required significantly greater\
    \ number of model \nruns to generate the probability distributions [64]. Employ-\n\
    ing a much different approach, Nandagiri [89] compared \ncalibration of a regional\
    \ surface runoff model in India using \nstreamflow records to areal evapotranspiration\
    \ estimations \nderived from meteorological data and evapotranspiration \nmodel.\
    \ Results suggest that areal evapotranspiration may \nsuccessfully be used to\
    \ calibrate hydrological models in un-\ngauged basins [89]. \nUse of Artificial\
    \ Intelligence in Watershed Modeling \nThe watershed models discussed earlier\
    \ adopt the physi-\ncally-based approach to modeling complex watershed proc-\n\
    esses on different spatial and temporal scales. Typically, this \nrequires describing\
    \ the watershed system’s inputs, the physi-\ncal laws which govern its behavior,\
    \ and boundary and initial \nconditions [19]. However, the traditional techniques\
    \ adopted \nin this approach tend be computationally intensive, requiring \nsignificant\
    \ data and calibration. To address some of these \nissues, researchers [e.g.,\
    \ 19, 92-96] have pursued a more \ndata-driven approach which utilize soft computing\
    \ or artifi-\ncial intelligence (AI), namely, artificial neural network \n(ANN),\
    \ fuzzy logic (FL), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). \nOver the past decade the literature\
    \ has recorded numerous \nexamples where researchers have successfully demonstrated\
    \ \nhow AI can be utilized for watershed hydrology applications \nsuch as real\
    \ time flood forecasting, rainfall–runoff modeling, \nand water quality prediction\
    \ models. The following \ndiscussion highlights selected past and more recent\
    \ water-\nshed hydrology applications using ANN, FL, and GA. \nArtificial Neural\
    \ Networks (ANN) \nANNs are considered computer programs capable of \nlearning\
    \ from examples through iteration without requiring \nprior knowledge of the relationships\
    \ between process pa-\nrameters [97, 98]. ANNs were inspired from biological nerv-\n\
    ous systems and are an attempt to emulate the human brain \n[98, 99]. Fig. (1)\
    \ illustrates the general ANN structure which \nis developed based on:  \n(1)\
    \ Many single elements called nodes (also known as \nunits, cells, or neurons),\
    \ shown as oval shapes and or-\nganized as layers. Each node typically applies\
    \ a non-\nlinear transformation called an activation function to \nits net input\
    \ signal to determine its output signal. \nThese functions enable ANN to map nonlinear\
    \ proc-\nesses.  \n(2) Signals pass between nodes through connection links. \n\
    Each connection link has an associated weight that \nrepresents its connection\
    \ strength. \n(3) Most ANN possess a transparent first or input layer \n(X) that\
    \ receives input variables or quantities that can \ninfluence the output or last\
    \ layer (Y) which consists \nof values needed to be predicted as part of a problem\
    \ \nor system. These networks also often possess middle \nor hidden layers which\
    \ are usually determined by a \ntrial-and-error procedure [100]. \nThe American\
    \ Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Task \nCommittee [100] notes that in order\
    \ for ANN to generate an \noutput, a training process, also called learning (similar\
    \ to the \nconcept of calibration in traditional physically-based mod-\nels),\
    \ is employed to iteratively adjust and optimize connec-\ntion weights and threshold\
    \ values for each node. The primary \ngoal of training is to minimize the error\
    \ function by search-\ning for a set of connection strengths and threshold values\
    \ that \ncause ANN to produce outputs that are equal or close to tar-\ngets. After\
    \ completing the training process, the next step is to \nutilize ANN to predict\
    \ results based on new inputs. See \nASCE-Task-Committee [100] for further details\
    \ on ANN \nfeatures and functionality. \nNoted strengths of ANNs which make their\
    \ use attractive \nfor water resources and hydrology applications include the\
    \ \nability to (i) recognize the relation between the input and \noutput variables\
    \ without explicit physical consideration; (ii) \nwork well even when the training\
    \ sets contain noise and \nmeasurement errors; (iii) adapt to solutions over time\
    \ to \ncompensate for changing circumstances; and (iv) possess \nother inherent\
    \ information-processing characteristics and \nonce trained are easy to use [100].\
    \ ANN hydrologic applica-\ntions range from the predictions of peak discharge\
    \ or time to \npeak for a single rainfall event, to the forecast of hourly or\
    \ \ndaily river stages or discharges. The complexities in physical \nprocesses\
    \ and nonlinear relationships of processes such as \n30    The Open Hydrology\
    \ Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al. \nrainfall-runoff and evapotransporation\
    \ were found to lend \nthemselves to ANN modeling [11, 101-103]. These ANN-\n\
    based models have been considered an alternate to physically \nbased models due\
    \ to their simplicity relative to minimizing \nthe need for collecting detailed\
    \ watershed data [102]. The \nmajor advantage of ANN over conventional methods\
    \ is the \nability to model physical processes without the need for de-\ntailed\
    \ information [104]. \nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, several research efforts\
    \ \n[e.g., 11, 103, 105-108] have shown ANN can be applied \neffectively across\
    \ different aspects of water resources and \nhydrology. Hjelmfelt and Wang [105,\
    \ 106] were among the \nfirst researchers to demonstrate the utility of ANNs in\
    \ mod-\neling these water resources processes. Here, they were able \nto use rainfall\
    \ and runoff data from 24 large storm events \nchosen from the Goodwater Creek\
    \ watershed (12.2 km2) in \ncentral Missouri to trainand test the ANNs. Results\
    \ revealed \nthat ANNs were able to generate a unit hydrograph better \nthan those\
    \ obtained through a standard gamma function rep-\nresentation. Smith and Eli\
    \ [107] were able to incorporate the \nspatial and temporal distribution information\
    \ of rainfall into \na ANN model that predicted peak discharge and time to peak\
    \ \nover a hypothetical watershed which was represented as a \ngrid of cells.\
    \ Using this method, they found the prediction of \nthe entire hydrograph to be\
    \ very accurate for multiple storm \nevents. Riad et al. [109] showed that ANN-based\
    \ models \nwere better than classical regression models for simulating \nrainfall-runoff\
    \ relations for a semiarid climate catchment \narea in Morocco. Recent work by\
    \ Wang et al. [110] con-\ncluded that ANN models not only out performed other\
    \ \nevapotransporation approximations developed in the semi-\narid region of Burikan\
    \ Faso, but they can also be utilized in \ndeveloping countries with adverse climatic\
    \ conditions [110]. \nOther studies [104, 111, 112] found that ANN models can\
    \ \npredict evapotranspiration and perform better than the Pen-\nman-Monteith\
    \ technique and other conventional methods. \nDespite the demonstrated benefits\
    \ of ANN, there are two \nkey challenges that should be mentioned. First, ANN\
    \ are \nusually implemented with a trial and error approach which \ntend to be\
    \ extremely time consuming [113]. May and Siva-\nkumar [114, 115] highlighted\
    \ this issue while investigating \nthe application of ANN and multi-linear regression\
    \ models \nfor predicting urban stormwater quality at unmonitored \ncatchments.\
    \ They concluded that both models generated \nsimilar prediction results but the\
    \ regression model appeared \nto represent a more applicable approach since it\
    \ was (i) faster \nto construct and apply; (ii) more transparent; and (iii) less\
    \ \nlikely to fit the limited data. The second limitation of ANNs \nidentified\
    \ by Moghaddamnia et al. [112] referenced the \ncomplicated input selection process.\
    \ They gained some suc-\ncess by using a gamma test to address this problem, explor-\n\
    ing different combinations of input data to assess their influ-\nence on evaporation\
    \ estimation modeling, showing that the \ngamma test greatly reduced model development\
    \ require-\nments, enabling provision of input data guidance prior to \nmodel\
    \ development. Despite these promising results, they \nsuggest that further evaluation\
    \ is needed, especially with \nrespect to its ability to assess validated data.\
    \  \nGenetic Algorithms (GA) \nGenetic Algorithms (GA) are nonlinear optimization\
    \ \nsearch techniques that imitate biological evolution processes \nof natural\
    \ selection and survival of the fittest [116, 117]. The \nmajor difference between\
    \ GAs and the other classical opti-\nmization techniques is that GAs work with\
    \ a population of \npossible solution while classical optimization techniques\
    \ \nwork with a single solution [118]. Soman et al. [119] sum-\nmarize the process\
    \ of creating GAs in the following steps:  \n(1) Generate a random number of solution\
    \ samples, \ncollectively called the population, within the feasi-\nble search\
    \ space. Each of these samples, called a \nchromosome, is defined by a sequence\
    \ of decision \nvariables known as genes (can be in binary strings \nof ones and\
    \ zeros of user specifiedlength, or real \nvalue numbers or integers). \n(2) Each\
    \ chromosome is assigned a measure of fit-\nness, based on the objective function\
    \ value. These \nchromosomesare referred to as species of the first \ngeneration.\
    \ For a maximization problem, the higher \nthe fitness values, the higher the\
    \ chance for sur-\nvival.  \n(3) Create the next generation of chromosomes. \n\
    This is accomplished by ranking the first genera-\ntion chromosomes in ascending\
    \ order of their fit-\nFig. (1). Configuration of feed forward three-layer ANN\

    \ Chromosomes with the highest fitness \nvalue will be given a higher probability\
    \ to obtain a \nmate, so as to produce offspring that may better fit \nthe environment.\
    \ This process of selecting mates is \ncalled selection. Once mates are selected,\
    \ genes of \ncorresponding mates, or parents, are systematically \nexchanged with\
    \ the conception that the resulting \nsolutions or offsprings will have higher\
    \ fitness val-\nues. The process of creating new individuals by \nsystematically\
    \ assigning genes of chosen mates to \nthe new individuals is known as crossover.\
    \ The \nnew chromosomes replace the old chromosomes, \nwhich have low fitness\
    \ values. \nThe process of selection and crossover is repeated for \nmany generations\
    \ with the objective of reaching the global \noptimal solution after a sufficient\
    \ number of generations. \nOther general forms of the GA include Genetic Program-\n\
    ming (GP) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which \nare explained in more\
    \ detail by Koza [120] and Ferreira \n[121].  \nSeveral early research efforts\
    \ demonstrated the useful-\nness of GA in water resources applications. Ritzel\
    \ et al. \n[118] adopted GA to solve groundwater pollution problems. \nWang and\
    \ Zheng [95] and Wu et al. [96] used GA-based \nfunctions to solve a groundwater\
    \ management model. Other \nresearchers [e.g., 122-128] made additional achievements\
    \ in \ndeveloping or improving rainfall-runoff models using GA. \nWang [127] was\
    \ successful in using GA with a local search \nmethod to calibrate the Xinanjiang\
    \ rainfall-runoff model. \nDrecourt [126] investigated the GP approach for flow\
    \ predic-\ntion on the Kirkton catchment in Scotland (United Kingdom) \nand found\
    \ that the results compared favorably with two op-\ntimally calibrated conceptual\
    \ models. Whigham and Crapper \n[128] compared a GP-based rainfall-runoff model\
    \ with a \ndeterministic lumped parameter model, based on the unit \nhydrograph\
    \ and found the results to be favorable as well. \nEfforts by Liong et al. [124]\
    \ were instrumental in demon-\nstrating GP as a new paradigm in rainfall-runoff\
    \ modeling. \nThey showed GP-based rainfall runoff relationships can \nserve as\
    \ alternatives to conventional (physically based and \nconceptual) rainfall runoff\
    \ models. In Singapore, Muttil and \nLiong [125] were able to apply GA programming\
    \ to generate \nempirically the underlying equations which connect input to \n\
    output for the Upper Bukit Timah watershed. \nMore recent research efforts [e.g.,\
    \ 19, 129-132] continue \nto demonstrate the utility of GA in support of water\
    \ re-\nsources applications. Guven et al. [131] developed a new \nGP-based model\
    \ for estimating reference evapotranspiration \nin northern California by using\
    \ five daily atmospheric vari-\nables (daily solar radiation, daily mean temperature,\
    \ average \ndaily relative humidity and wind speed). They concluded that \nthe\
    \ new model results were in good agreement with conven-\ntional evapotranspiration\
    \ models (here, the Penman-\nMonteith equation, Hargreaves-Samani equation, solar\
    \ radia-\ntion-based ET equation, Jensen-Haise equation, Jones-\nRitchie equation,\
    \ and Turc method) and can be used as an \nalternative approach. It was also concluded\
    \ that the GP-\nbased model offered a fast and practical method for accu-\nrately\
    \ estimating evapotransporation [131].  \nYao and Yang [132] note that the complexity\
    \ of parame-\nter optimization for a distributed watershed model goes far \nbeyond\
    \ the capability of traditional optimization methods. \nTo address this problem,\
    \ a new GA-based optimization \nmethod was developed and tested using the Distributed-\n\
    Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation model (DHSVM). Results of this \neffort demonstrate\
    \ the feasibility of GA in optimizing pa-\nrameters of the DHSVM model. Hejaziet\
    \ al. [129] and Preis \nand Ostfeld [19] demonstrated that GA can be coupled with\
    \ \nother flow or water quality models to develop and augment \ncalibration schemes.\
    \  \nGuven [130] investigated the use of linear genetic pro-\ngramming (a variant\
    \ of GP) for predicting time-series of \ndaily flow rates the Schuylkill River\
    \ at Berne, PA, USA and \nfound that the results showed good agreement with observed\
    \ \ndata. Results also showed that the GP-based model out per-\nformed an ANN-based\
    \ model. These findings demonstrate \nGP’s promise for predicting the nonlinear\
    \ and dynamic river \nflow parameters [130]. \nAlthough GAs have proven to be\
    \ an effective and power-\nful problem-solving strategy, they possess several\
    \ limita-\ntions. The common thread in many of the difficulties with \nGAs has\
    \ to do with their significant dependence on control \nparameters such as population\
    \ size, crossover probability, \nand choice of crossover operator [133]. Jackson\
    \ and Norgard \n[133] summarize these issues as follows: \n(1) A GA may not know\
    \ when it is done or lack \nproof of convergence. One possible way to deal \n\
    with this problem is to examine a series of consecu-\ntive generations for solution\
    \ improvement.  \n(2) GAs need to maintain a large population of solu-\ntions\
    \ which provides the genetic diversity needed to \nadequately explore the solution\
    \ space. Too small a \npopulation will result in premature convergence on \na\
    \ local minimum. While large populations enable \nsuperior performance, they also\
    \ require more mem-\nory and more execution time. \n(3) Excessive reliance on\
    \ crossover to introduce \nnew genetic material can also result in premature \n\
    convergence. The dominance of crossover as the \nprincipal stochastic process\
    \ may cause the popula-\ntion to become more homogeneous, and thus stag-\nnating\
    \ the evolutionary process.  \n(4) GAs are also known to have poor performance\
    \ \nin climbing local hills in the solution space which \nresults in reducing\
    \ accuracy for many real-valued \nproblems. This difficulty is a byproduct of\
    \ the sole \ndependence of the algorithm on stochastic processes \nto improve\
    \ solutions rather than on an analytical \napproach. \nJackson and Norgard [133]\
    \ suggest that these limitations \nof GAs can be addressed effectively by combining\
    \ GAs with \nother algorithms and techniques. \nFuzzy Logic (FL) \nThe FL approach\
    \ to modeling is based on the theory of \nfuzzy sets [134], where relationships\
    \ are defined verbally \n32    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel\
    \ et al. \ninstead of using known governing physical relationships. \nClassic\
    \ set theory assigns an item as a member of a set (1) or \na non-member of a set\
    \ (0), while a fuzzy set allows for gra-\ndations between full membership and\
    \ full non-membership. \nThe main idea is to define the fuzzy membership functions\
    \ \nwhich define relationships between input variables and out-\nputs of a system\
    \ [135]. Mahabir et al. [135] identify the main \nsteps for creating a FL-based\
    \ modeling system as follows:  \n(1) A membership function must be defined for\
    \ each \nvariable (input and output). The membership function de-\nfines the degree\
    \ to which the value of a variable belongs to \nthe group and is usually a linguistic\
    \ term, such as high, me-\ndium, or low. \n(2) The membership functions are related\
    \ by statements \nor rules, typically a series of IF–THEN statements. For ex-\n\
    ample, one rule would be: IF the rainfall is low (linguistic \nterm represented\
    \ by a membership function) THEN the run-\noff (output) is low (linguistic term\
    \ represented by a member-\nship function). \n(3) Each rule is evaluated through\
    \ a process called impli-\ncation, and the results of all of the rules are combined\
    \ in a \nprocess called aggregation. \n(4) The resulting function is evaluated\
    \ for a resulting \nvalue or score for the output variable (e.g., runoff) through\
    \ a \nprocess called defuzzification. \nThe two main FL-based modeling systems\
    \ included are: \n(i) fuzzy inference systems, which work on already con-\nstructed\
    \ rule-base mainly on the basis of expert knowledge, \nand (ii) fuzzy adaptive\
    \ systems, which can also build and \nadjust rule-base automatically based on\
    \ sample or training \ndata. Two significant advantages of FL–based models are\
    \ \ntheir ability to be error tolerant and integrate expert knowl-\nedge from\
    \ water resource specialists [94]. Guertin et al. \n[136] also point out that\
    \ the FL approach is well suited to \nwatersheds studies as many environmental\
    \ factors are best \nexpressed as gradients.  \nLike ANN and GA, the FL technique\
    \ does have its limi-\ntations. Three key disadvantages were identified in the\
    \ litera-\nture and presented here. Casper et al. [94] note that the larg-\nest\
    \ disadvantage of the fuzzy adaptive systems is its inability \nto extrapolate\
    \ without detailed expert knowledge about the \nwatershed system or process being\
    \ simulated. The second \ndisadvantage of fuzzy inference and fuzzy adaptive (aug-\n\
    mented with expert knowledge) systems is their strong reli-\nance on subjective\
    \ inputs from experts which might provide \nmore opportunity for their abuse [137].\
    \ Ferson and Tucker \n[138] also note that FL-based systems may also fail to cap-\n\
    ture the value range of complex data sets and the correlations \namong parameters.\
    \ Further details on FL theory and applica-\ntions are provided in Zimmermann\
    \ [139] and Dubois and \nPrade [140].  \nAccording to Yu and Yang [76], FL can\
    \ be applied to \nhydrologic modeling where a hydrologist defines the accept-\n\
    able degree of a simulation in the form of linguistic expres-\nsions such as ‘bad’\
    \ and ‘good’ based on their knowledge or \nexpert judgment. Researchers have been\
    \ successful in their \nearly attempts at applying FL for solving water resource\
    \ \nproblems or modeling hydrologic processes including infil-\ntration [141],\
    \ contaminant fate and transport [142], recon-\nstruction of missing precipitation\
    \ events [143] river level and \nflood forecasting [144, 145], rainfall-runoff\
    \ modeling [76, \n146, 147], daily future water demand modeling [148], \ndrought\
    \ classification [149], and regional drought prediction \n[150]. \nMore recent\
    \ research trends in the utilization of the FL \nmodeling approach highlight additional\
    \ efforts targeted at \ncombining other AI methods in hybrid systems. Chang et\
    \ al. \n[151] developed a FL based method that was applied to pre-\ncipitation\
    \ interpolation and utilized GA to determine parame-\nters for the FL functions\
    \ which represent locations without \nrainfall records and their surrounding rainfall\
    \ gauges. Cheng \net al. [80] combined FL-GA methods to develop a rainfall-\n\
    run model while Chidthong et al. [152] and Chen et al. [93] \nutilized similar\
    \ methods to forecast flooding. Combining FL \nand ANN also offer options for\
    \ improving modeling tech-\nniques and managing water resource problems. For example,\
    \ \nTayfur and Singh [153] demonstrated that FL-ANN based \nmodels can be useful\
    \ in simulating event based rainfall run-\noff on a watershed scale and are much\
    \ easier to construct \nthan the models based on the well-know kinematic wave\
    \ \napproximation method. Chang and Chang [154] utilized an \nadaptive neuro-fuzzy\
    \ (FL and ANN) inference system for \npredicting water levels in reservoirs. Firat\
    \ and Gungor [155] \nalso investigated the use of similar systems for estimating\
    \ \nriver flows. Chidthong et al. [152] were successful in devel-\noping a hybrid\
    \ system using FL, ANN, and GA for predict-\ning peak flooding.  \nSpatial Considerations\
    \ in Watershed Modeling \nAs previously mentioned, watershed modeling involves\
    \ a \nholistic approach that involves not only examining surface \nhydrology,\
    \ groundwater hydrology, or their interface as \nwhole systems, but attempting\
    \ to imitate the three regions as \none system. Scale-up of each of these regions\
    \ from the water \nbody (lake, river, stream, etc.) or aquifer to an entire catch-\n\
    ment or watershed presents obvious problems. One limita-\ntion is the availability\
    \ of precipitation, flow, land cover, etc. \ndata for the entire region. Another\
    \ consideration is the lim-\nited understanding of the interactions between smaller\
    \ hydro-\nlogic entities. Several studies have examined the effects of \nscaling\
    \ in watershed modeling [156-161]. Furthermore, the \nscale or resolution of data\
    \ used can impact the accuracy of \nthe model results [161-163]. The following\
    \ sections high-\nlight the more prominent issues relating to scale and data \n\
    resolution in watershed modeling.  \nScale-up from Hydrologic Models to Watershed\
    \ Models \nMuch work has been done to conceptualize watershed in-\nteractions\
    \ at the hillslope (sub-catchment) level resulting in \nhighly complex relationships\
    \ from field experimentation. \nSome suggest that watershed models should maintain\
    \ this \ncomplexity and efforts should be made to ensure that the \nsmaller scale\
    \ relationships are somehow incorporated into \nthe mesoscale watershed models\
    \ [164]. Unfortunately, data \nlimitations, computational complexity, and financial\
    \ con-\nstraints limit the amount of information that may be gathered \nfrom the\
    \ field to represent entire watersheds. Bloschl and \nSivapalan [158] published\
    \ a review of scale issues in hydro-\nlogical modelling at the catchment level\
    \ in 1995. In this, \ndiscussions on simplification versus aggregation of hydro-\n\
    Watershed Modeling and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume\
    \ 5    33 \nlogic parameters, scale up versus scale down, and the linkage \nacross\
    \ various modelling scales are presented.  \nProblems associated with scale-up\
    \ of hydrologic proc-\nesses to the watershed-scale include generalization and\
    \ over \nparameterization. Through generalization or simplification, \nprocesses\
    \ and variables that are applicable to a small portion \nof the watershed may\
    \ be applied to the entire region. In this, \nthe true representation of processes\
    \ taking place may be lost. \nOver parameterization occurs when the watershed\
    \ is repre-\nsented by multiple (possibly many) parameters/variables to \nthe\
    \ point that a holistic representation of the region is no \nlonger present [158].\
    \ While Jakeman and Hornberger [165] \nsuggest only a few parameters are identifiable/necessary\
    \ for \nhydrologic models, van Werkhoven et al. [166] argue that \nthe number\
    \ of parameters necessary for watershed modeling \nis dependent on the focus of\
    \ the model and experimental \ndesign. They suggest use of sensitivity analysis\
    \ and thorough \ninvestigation on the model behaviour to determine the ap-\npropriate\
    \ level of parameters involved to represent the water-\nshed. \nSivapalan [164]\
    \ suggests that identification of common \npatterns, or features found at the\
    \ hillslope scale within a \nwatershed can be applied to larger regions to assist\
    \ in scale-\nup to the watershed level. In addition, Wong [167] \nrecommends use\
    \ of physically-based models to replace \nempirical models noting that during\
    \ scale-up from empirical \nhydrologic models to watershed-scale models physically-\n\
    based relationships can be used to bridge the gaps. Kalin et \nal. [168] state\
    \ that the spatial scale of the catchment is \ndirectly proportional to the complexity\
    \ involved in modelling \nhydrologic processes of rainfall-runoff and surface\
    \ erosion. \nWhether a lumped or semi-distributed model is used is \ndependent\
    \ on the level of detail desired in the output and \ndata available for representing\
    \ the watershed.  \nImpacts of Data Resolution \nModeling the hydrologic responses\
    \ over a watershed re-\nquires use of soil maps and/or soil surveys to provide\
    \ infor-\nmation on the distribution of soil types and thus soil hydro-\nlogic\
    \ properties. Previously, soil maps produced from sur-\nveys of the region were\
    \ the only source of this information. \nNow, remote sensing (RS) and digital\
    \ terrain analysis can be \nutilized through geographic information system (GIS)\
    \ tech-\nniques [169] which are more accurate with higher resolution \ndata than\
    \ previous methods. In addition, the availability of \nprecipitation data may\
    \ be sparse and limiting. Gathering \nmeasurements over a large area may not be\
    \ economically \nfeasible, so modelers use genetic algorithms or other tech-\n\
    niques discussed previously to fill gaps and provide better \nrepresentation of\
    \ data over the entire watershed area. \nOften, digital elevation models (DEMs)\
    \ are used to iden-\ntify stream networks/rivers and the land slopes that contrib-\n\
    ute flow to these waterbodies. DEMs can be publicly ob-\ntained at various resolutions\
    \ (e.g., 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m), \nwhich can impact the accuracy of hydrograph\
    \ generation and \nidentification of tributaries/river networks [163]. DEMs are\
    \ \ndigital surfaces representing the area of interest with a grid \nof given\
    \ resolution placed over the surface and elevation data \nassigned to each cell.\
    \ Each DEM grid cell drains a specific \ndirection based upon its slope and the\
    \ slope of the cells \naround it. Streams or channel networks are identified by\
    \ us-\ning the slope information of DEM grid cells and assigning a \nthreshold\
    \ area (the minimum area that would drain to a point \nfor a stream channel to\
    \ form). The stream network is com-\nprised of a set of points that have summed\
    \ areas of cells \nabove the threshold value draining toward them. The resolu-\n\
    tion of the DEM can impact the slope of grid cells due to the \narea covered and\
    \ averaging of elevations, and thus, the iden-\ntification of stream networks\
    \ [168, 170]. DEM resolution \nalso impacts the delineation of the watersheds.\
    \ Ridge lines \nare commonly used to define watersheds because these rep-\nresent\
    \ the divide for which portion of precipitation flows in \nwhich direction.  \n\
    In a study by Zhu and Mackay [169], the impacts of us-\ning traditional soil maps\
    \ versus soil information derived \nfrom both fuzzy logic and digital elevation\
    \ models (DEMs) \nwere evaluated for the Lubrecht area in Montana. Using the \n\
    newer technology, they found that peak runoff was reduced \nthus producing more\
    \ realistic hydrographs. Yang et al. [163], \nevaluated the effects of DEM resolution\
    \ on geomorphic \nproperties (i.e., identification of river networks and hydro-\n\
    logical response). In their study, fifteen catchments in Japan \nwere analyzed\
    \ using differing DEM resolutions. An increase \nin DEM mesh size (less resolution)\
    \ led to loss in the amount \nof tributaries identified, flatter topography due\
    \ to averaging \nof elevations for individual DEM grid cells and less accurate\
    \ \nrepresentation of the hydrological response of the catchment \n[163].  \n\
    The required resolution of data used in the modeling ef-\nfort may be dependent\
    \ on the output desired. Kalin et al. \n[168] evaluated the resolution required\
    \ for different outputs \nfor two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimen-\n\
    tal watersheds. When the peak runoff is the primary concern, \nthe highest resolution\
    \ is optimal. Meanwhile, if modelers are \nonly interested in sediment load at\
    \ the outlet, lower resolu-\ntion of model input data may be used.  \nHydrologic\
    \ and Hydrodynamic Models for Watershed \nModeling \nThis section provides a review\
    \ of current state-of-the-art \nof watershed-scale models, including discussion\
    \ of their \nstrengths and weaknesses when applied to various watershed \nand\

    \ (AGN-\nPS/AnnAGNPS) \nThe current version of AGNPS is the AnnAGNPS model \n\
    [173, 174] which was developed to simulate, on a daily time \nstep, the sediment\
    \ and nutrient transport from an agricultural \nwatershed, ranging in size from\
    \ a few hectares up to 300,000 \nhectares (3x109 m2). AnnAGNPS is a semi-empirical,\
    \ dis-\ntributed, continuous simulation watershed-scale model with \noutput options\
    \ for an event, monthly, or annual basis [173, \n174]. The AnnAGNPS model can\
    \ assist with the manage-\nment of runoff, erosion, and nutrient movement by perform-\n\
    ing cost-benefit analysis. The model can simulate several \nbest management practices\
    \ (BMPs) including ponds, vegeta-\ntive filters strips, riparian buffers, and\
    \ others [37]. Borah and \nBera [5] also note that the model is useful for analyzing\
    \ \nlong-term effects of hydrological changes and watershed \nmanagement practices,\
    \ especially agricultural practices. The \nmodel has been utilized in several\
    \ studies with mixed results \n[175-178]. In Australia, Baginska et al. [179]\
    \ showed the \nevent flow predictions to be satisfactory, Das et al. [180] \n\
    were able to produce runoff results for the Canagagigue \nCreek watershed of southwestern\
    \ Ontario with acceptable \naccuracy, while Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al.\
    \ [175] \nhighlighted that the model can produce adequate results for \npredicting\
    \ long-term monthly and annual runoff.  \nKey limitations of the AnnAGNPS model\
    \ include: (i) an \ninability to simulate base flow or frozen soil conditions;\
    \ (ii) \nthe mass balance calculation for water inflow and outflow is \nnot provided\
    \ as the model does not account for spatially \nvarying rainfall over the watershed;\
    \ and (iii) the runoff simu-\nlation is not entirely based on physical laws [6].\
    \ Model re-\nsults from Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al. [175] show that \n\
    the overland flow inadequately represented the riparian ar-\neas, and predictions\
    \ on nutrients and sediment loads are \noverestimated. Proper cell discretization\
    \ was suggested as an \noption for improving runoff estimates. In Nepal, Shrestha\
    \ et \nal. [181] showed that model event-based peak flow results \nwere over predicted.\
    \ AnnAGNPS is also not adequately for-\nmulated to simulate intense single-event\
    \ storms [171]. Borah \net al. [182] concluded that the AGNPS model is not suitable\
    \ \nfor analyzing a storm when the flow and constituent concen-\ntrations and\
    \ loads drastically vary. They also noted that the \nuse of AGNPS in studying\
    \ impacts of BMPs is qualitative \nsince AGNPS does consider subsurface and groundwater\
    \ \nprocesses [183]. \nBoth AGNPS and AnnAGNPS use the Curve Number \n(CN) method,\
    \ which does not reproduce measured runoff \nfrom specific storm rainfall events\
    \ because the time distribu-\ntion is not considered [183-187]. Additional limitations\
    \ in-\nclude: (i) no explicit account of the effect of the antecedent \nmoisture\
    \ conditions in runoff computation; (ii) difficulties in \nseparating storm runoff\
    \ from the total discharge hydrograph; \nand (iii) runoff processes not considered\
    \ by the empirical \nformula [183, 186, 187]. Croley and He [188] suggest that\
    \ \nthese limitations will result in CN estimates of runoff and \ninfiltration\
    \ which are not reflective of actual values. In addi-\ntion, they note that sediment,\
    \ nutrient, and pesticide load-\nings, which are directly related to infiltration\
    \ and runoff, may \ngenerate inaccurate estimates for non-point source pollution\
    \ \nrates. \n36    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al.\
    \ \nAreal Non-PointSource Watershed Environment Simula-\ntion (ANSWERS) \nANSWERS\
    \ is comprised of two major response compo-\nnents: hydrology [189] and upland\
    \ erosion [190]. The water-\nshed area is divided into grids (less than 10,000\
    \ m) where all \nproperties (e.g., soil properties, land use, slopes, crops, nutri-\n\
    ents, and management practices) are considered homoge-\nnous. ANSWERS-2000, an\
    \ expanded version of ANSWERS \n[191], utilizes breakpoint rainfall data and performs\
    \ simula-\ntion on 30-second time steps for runoff events and a daily \ntime step\
    \ between runoff events. Simulation is limited to \nmedium-size watersheds (5x106\
    \ to 3x107 m) where surface \nhydrologic processes dominate. In addition, the\
    \ model also \nhas the capability of simulating transformations and interac-\n\
    tions between four nitrogen pools including stable organic N, \nactive organic\
    \ N, nitrate, and ammonium. A surface runoff \nhydrograph is provided at both\
    \ the watershed outlet and any \nother user-selected point within the watershed\
    \ [192]. \nANSWERS and ANSWERS-2000 models were designed \nfor ungauged watersheds,\
    \ as well as for evaluating the effec-\ntiveness of agricultural and urban watershed\
    \ best manage-\nment practices (BMPs) in decreasing sediment and nutrient \ntransport\
    \ to streams during surface runoff events [37, 193]. \nAvailable literature [6,\
    \ 171, 193-195] provides some of the \nachievements and issues related to the\
    \ application of these \nmodels. For example, Connolly et al. [194] showed that\
    \ \nANSWERS could be used to predict runoff at a catchment \noutlet and generate\
    \ fairly accurate simulations for different \nsurface cover conditions; however,\
    \ runoff predictions were \nless accurate at low rainfall intensity events when\
    \ compared \nto higher intensity events. They also pointed out that com-\nplex\
    \ watersheds could be modeled without calibration; al-\nthough promoting confidence\
    \ in the model, one would be ill-\nadvised to follow such advice. \nDillaha et\
    \ al. [193] evaluated ANSWERS-2000 on two \nwatersheds in Watkinsville, Georgia;\
    \ it performed well in \npredicting runoff, sediment, nitrate, dissolved ammonium,\
    \ \nsediment-bound total Kjeldahlnitrogen (TKN), and dissolved \nphosphorus losses\
    \ from both watersheds. They also tested \nthe model on the 1,153 hectare (1.15x107\
    \ m2) Owl Run wa-\ntershed in Virginia, where it also performed well for the \n\
    largest storms, and cumulative predictions of runoff volume, \nsediment yield,\
    \ nitrate, ammonium, sediment-bound TKN, \nand orthophosphorus were within 40\
    \ percent of the measured \nvalues. Other research by Bai et al. [195] showed\
    \ that the \nmodel adequately simulated runoff during non-snow seasons.  \nOogathoo\
    \ [6] notes that a key weakness of ANSWERS is \nits inability to simulate interflow\
    \ and groundwater contribu-\ntions to base flow, snow pack, and snowmelt. This\
    \ suggests \nthe model is less suitable for locations where base flow con-\ntribution,\
    \ winter snow accumulation, and snow melt are high. \nBorah and Bera [5] also\
    \ noted ANSWERS is not adequately \nformulated to simulate intense single-event\
    \ storms and has \npotential numerical problems inherent in its solutions. They\
    \ \nalso mentioned that ANSWERS-2000 does not have channel \nerosion and sediment\
    \ transport routines; therefore, the sedi-\nment and chemical components are not\
    \ applicable to water-\nsheds. Like AGNPS and AnnAGNPS, ANSWERS and AN-\nSWERS-2000\
    \ utilize the CN method and face the same limi-\ntations identified earlier by\
    \ Beven [186], Croley and He \n[188], and Garen and Moore [187].  \nGridded \n\
    Surface \nSubsurface \nHydrologic \nAnalysis \n(GSSHA)/CASC2D \nCASC2D [196] is\
    \ a physically-based model that was de-\nveloped to predict surface runoff in\
    \ arid to semi-arid basins. \nWater and sediment are simulated in two-dimensional\
    \ over-\nland grids and one-dimensional channels. Both single-event \nand long-term\
    \ continuous simulations are possible. The wa-\ntershed is divided into cells,\
    \ and water and sediment are \nrouted from one to another. GSSHA [31, 32], an\
    \ enhance-\nment of CASC2D, adds the ability to simulate saturated and \nunsaturated\
    \ groundwater, allowing use of the model in a va-\nriety of climates and watersheds.\
    \ While increasing the capa-\nbility of the CASC2D model, all functionality of\
    \ the \nCASC2D model has been retained, with significant im-\nprovements in model\
    \ stability and efficiency.  \nGSSHA, a component within the U.S. Department of\
    \ De-\nfense’s (DOD) Watershed Modeling System (WMS) [197], \nwas developed to\
    \ provide hydrologic predictions in the wid-\nest variety of places and conditions\
    \ including the complex \nspatial organization in an urban environment. This may\
    \ have \nimportant implications for the development of techniques for \nTable\

    \ Journal, 2011 Volume 5    37 \nrunoff modeling, flood prediction, and planning\
    \ in urbanized \nareas [31]. GSSHA has new or improved CASC2D features \nsuch\
    \ as the ability to simulate major hydrologic storage units \n(e.g., lakes, wetlands,\
    \ and reservoirs) and an improvement in \nthe predictions of in-stream sediment\
    \ transport, especially \nduring large rainfall events [31]. Both models were\
    \ tested on \nthe Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed in Mississippi \nwhere\
    \ it was shown that the accuracy of sediment discharge \nfor selected storms was\
    \ superior when using GSSHA [31, \n198]. Despite these results, other studies\
    \ [e.g., 37] indicate \nthat the model may have major limitations such as the\
    \ poten-\ntial to generate very poor sediment results. Kalin and Han-\ntush [37]\
    \ suggest erosion in channels is not transport limited, \nwhich means the model\
    \ generates sediment that has a vol-\nume greater than what the flow can carry.\
    \ Another limitation \nfor the model is its numerical schemes, which are computa-\n\
    tionally intensive and demand large amounts of data [171]. \nAccording to Ogden\
    \ and Julien [199], simulation times can \nbecome prohibitive when the number\
    \ of model grid cells \nexceeds 100,000; therefore, the model may become prohibi-\n\
    tive for medium to large-sized watersheds [171]. \nHEC-1/HEC-HMS  \nHEC-1, developed\
    \ to simulate hydrologic processes (pre-\ncipitation, losses, baseflow, runoff\
    \ transformation, and rout-\ning) on watersheds ranging in size from 1 km2 to\
    \ 100,000 \nkm2, produces runoff hydrographs at single or multiple loca-\ntions\
    \ on complex watershed networks for gauged and hypo-\nthetical rainfall events\
    \ [200]. HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engi-\nneering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System)\
    \ [201, 202] is \nthe “next generation\" and state-of-the-art Windows-based \n\
    model for precipitation-runoff simulation that will supersede \nthe HEC-1 model.\
    \ HEC-HMS provides a variety of options \nfor simulating precipitation-runoff\
    \ and routing processes, \nand is comprised of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\
    \ [203], \nintegrated hydrologic analysis components, data storage and \nmanagement\
    \ capabilities, and graphics and reporting facili-\nties [201, 202]. Both HEC-1\
    \ [200] and HEC-HMS [201] \nhave been widely used for modeling floods and impacts\
    \ on \nland use changes [6]. Duru and Hjelmfelt [204], using the \nmodel's kinematic\
    \ wave method, found that even with lim-\nited calibration, runoff prediction\
    \ for ungauged catchments \nwas good and impacts of land use on the hydrologic\
    \ cycle \ncould be evaluated accurately. Additionally, a study con-\nducted in\
    \ northern Ontario, Canada showed that HEC-1 \nmodel could be used for runoff\
    \ simulation in an ungauged \nwatershed [205].  \nEven though HEC-1/HEC-HMS has\
    \ been widely used, \nOogathoo [6] notes that it excludes certain important fea-\n\
    tures. The model is constrained to a constant time step, \nwhich may not be suitable\
    \ for components requiring detailed \nanalysis. Since it is semi-distributed,\
    \ the model assumes hy-\ndrologic processes to occur uniformly within each sub-basin.\
    \ \nAlso, as the primary purpose of the model is to determine \nflood hydrographs,\
    \ a simple method is used for the baseflow \nsimulation; therefore, the loss component\
    \ of the model is not \ntracked down in absence of precipitation, that is, the\
    \ soil \ndoes not dry out and recover its loss potential. Other limita-\ntions\
    \ identified by Scharffenberg [201] include uncoupled \nmodels for evapotranspiration-infiltration\
    \ and infiltration-\nbase flow processes, no aquifer interactions, the allowance,\
    \ \nbut limited capability, of flow splits within the dendritic \nstream systems,\
    \ and the lack of downstream flow influence \nor reversal which makes backwater\
    \ possible but only if con-\ntained within a reach.  \nHydrological Simulation\
    \ Program-Fortran (HSPF) \nHSPF [206, 207] is a semi-distributed, continuous model\
    \ \nthat simulates hydrologic and associated water quality proc-\nesses on pervious\
    \ and impervious land surfaces, in streams, \nand in well-mixed impoundments where\
    \ water movement is \nsimulated as overland flow, interflow, and groundwater flow.\
    \ \nAlso simulated are snowpack depth and water content, \nsnowmelt, evapotranspiration,\
    \ ground-water recharge, dis-\nsolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, temperature,\
    \ \npesticides, conservatives, fecal coliforms, sediment detach-\nment and transport,\
    \ sediment routing by particle, size, chan-\nnel routing, reservoir routing, constituent\
    \ routing, pH, am-\nmonia, nitrate-nitrite, organic nitrogen, orthophosphate,\
    \ or-\nganic phosphorous, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The \nmodel utilizes\
    \ hydrological response units (HRUs) based on \nuniform climate and storage capacity\
    \ factors. Periods from a \nfew minutes to hundreds of years can be simulated.\
    \ \nSimulation results include a time history of the runoff flow \nrate, \nsediment\
    \ \nload, \nand \nnutrient \nand \npesticide \nconcentrations, along with a time\
    \ history of water quantity \nand quality at any point in a watershed. HSPF simulates\
    \ \nthree sediment types (sand, silt, and clay) in addition to a \nsingle organic\
    \ chemical and transformation products of that \nchemical [206, 207]. \nGenerally\
    \ used to assess the effects of land use change, \nreservoir operations, point\
    \ or non-point source treatment \nalternatives, and flow diversions [37], HSPF\
    \ is also suitable \nfor mixed agricultural and urban watersheds [171]. Some of\
    \ \nthe key strengths of the model identified by Aqua Terra \n[208] include: (i)\
    \ a comprehensive representation of water-\nshed land, stream processes, and watershed\
    \ pollutant \nsources, including non-point (by multiple land uses), point, \n\
    and atmospheric sources; (ii) flexibility and adaptability to a \nwide range of\
    \ watershed conditions; and (iii) well-designed \ncode modularity and structure.\
    \ Oogathoo [6] and AquaTerra \n[208] note that HSPF’s key limitations derive from\
    \ it not \nbeing fully distributed or physically-based. As a result, wa-\ntershed\
    \ characteristics and climatic parameters are lumped \ninto several units, and\
    \ both empirical and physical equations \nare used to simulate the water flow\
    \ [6]. In addition, due to its \nconceptualization of the overland (sub-basin)\
    \ areas as lev-\neled detention storage and use of the storage-based or non-\n\
    linear flow equations in routings, HSPF is not adequate for \nsimulating intense\
    \ single-event storms, especially for large \nsub-basins and long channels [6,\
    \ 171]. The model requires \nextensive data requirements (e.g., hourly rainfall)\
    \ and avail-\nable documentation provides no comprehensive parameter \nestimation\
    \ guidance. As a result, user training is normally \nrequired [208]. In their\
    \ effort to evaluate the model, Saleh \nand Du [209] highlighted these issues\
    \ as they found the cali-\nbration process tends to be strenuous and long. \n\
    Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) \nRepresented by a cascade of planes\
    \ and channels, \nKINEROS2 may be used to determine the effects of various \n\
    artificial features such as urban developments, small deten-\ntion reservoirs,\
    \ or lined channels on flood hydrographs and \nsediment yield [33]. The model\
    \ is also adopted as part of the \n38    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume\
    \ 5 \nDaniel et al. \nAutomated \nGeospatial \nWatershed \nAssessment \nTool \n\
    (AGWA) software system [210, 211]. Limited to Hortonian \nflow \nand \nnot \n\
    designed \nfor \nlong-term \nsimulations, \nKINEROS2 lacks an evapotranspiration\
    \ component impor-\ntant for the mass balance of the water cycle [37]; however,\
    \ \nwith its complete set of hydrology and sediment components, \nthe model serves\
    \ as a useful tool for studying single severe \nor design storms and evaluating\
    \ watershed management \npractices, especially structural practices [171]. Using\
    \ a small \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimental wa-\ntershed located\
    \ near Treynor, Iowa, Kalin and Hantush[37] \ntested the model and showed that\
    \ it was also extremely ro-\nbust in simulating erosion and sediment transport.\
    \ The model \nwas designed for arid and semi-arid areas [212]; however, \nseveral\
    \ studies [210, 213-215] highlight the ability of the \nmodel to successfully\
    \ simulate erosion, sediment transport, \nand characterize the runoff response\
    \ of the watershed due to \nchanges of land cover in arid and semi-arid watersheds.\
    \ La-\njili-Ghezal [215] conducted similar assessments on the \nM'Richet El Anze\
    \ watershed in a Tunisian semi-arid area \nand concluded that the model was adequate\
    \ for predicting \nrunoff from ungauged watersheds and for evaluating future \n\
    land use master-plans for Tunisian semi-arid high lands. \nMiller et al. [210]\
    \ also used KINEROS2 within the AGWA \nframework to successfully assess increased\
    \ event runoff vol-\numes and flashier flood response in watersheds that contrib-\n\
    ute runoff to the upper San Pedro River in Sonora, Mexico \nand southeast Arizona.\
    \ \nUnlike most of the studies mentioned, Al-Qurashiet al. \n[212] were less successful\
    \ when assessing the model using \ndata from a large arid catchment in Oman. Despite\
    \ relatively \nextensive and high resolution rainfall-runoff data, and their \n\
    efforts to optimize performance using automatic calibration \nand by adding a\
    \ rainfall parameter, the model validation per-\nformance was poor, and in general,\
    \ no better than achieved \nusing a ‘default’ parameter set [212]. Borah and Bera\
    \ [5] \nnote that the model does a relatively good job of simulating \nrunoff\
    \ and sediment yield at watershed scales of up to ap-\nproximately 1,000 hectares\
    \ (1x107 m2); however, such poor \nresults may arise since applications of the\
    \ model are limited \nto small watersheds and specific combinations of space and\
    \ \ntime increments for maintaining stability of the numerical \nsolutions. Overall,\
    \ a key weakness of the model is the ab-\nsence of chemical/nutrient components\
    \ [171] which limit its \ncapabilities to simulate for BMPs [37]. \nMIKE SHE \
    \ \nMIKE SHE is a fully integrated, distributed, and physi-\ncally-based watershed\
    \ model that simulates the major proc-\nesses in the hydrologic cycle and includes\
    \ process models for \nevapotranspiration, overland flow, unsaturated flow, ground\
    \ \nflow, channel flow, and their interactions [34]. It is used \nmostly at the\
    \ watershed scale and from a single soil profile to \nseveral sub-watersheds with\
    \ different soil types [216, 217]. \nThe model's distributed nature allows a spatial\
    \ distribution of \nwatershed parameters, climate variables, and hydrological\
    \ \nresponse through an orthogonal grid network and column of \nhorizontal layers\
    \ at each grid square in the horizontal and \nvertical, respectively [218]. The\
    \ model can be used for storm \nor long-term events with a variable time step.\
    \ Being physi-\ncally-based, the topography, along with watershed character-\n\
    istics such as vegetation and soil properties, is included in \nthe model. With\
    \ a modular structure, MIKE SHE is capable \nof exchanging data between components\
    \ as well as adding \nnew process model components. The flexible operating \n\
    structure of MIKE SHE allows the use of as many or as few \ncomponents of the\
    \ model, based on availability of data [219].  \nMIKE SHE is considered the most\
    \ comprehensive water-\nshed model with virtually all of the in-surface and surface\
    \ \nphases of the hydrologic cycle [37]. It also has many of the \noptions to\
    \ simulate wetlands, and nutrient and pesticide \nmanagement. The model is being\
    \ used for a wide variety of \napplications in different countries, including\
    \ England [220], \nAustralia [221], Canada [6], and the United States [222]. \n\
    Some of the notable application areas include river basin \nmanagement and modeling\
    \ [223], integrated ground/surface \nwater modeling [221, 222], irrigation [224-226],\
    \ land use \nchanges, and anthropogenic effects [27].  \nThompson et al. [220]\
    \ used the model simulated in a wet-\nland in England and found that the simulation\
    \ results consis-\ntently matched the observed data and reproduced the sea-\n\
    sonal dynamics of groundwater and ditch water levels. Sahoo \net al. [84] used\
    \ the model in a mountainous region of Hawaii \nto study watershed response to\
    \ storm events and found the \nresults were comparable to the observed data. In\
    \ addition, \nDemetriou and Punthakey [221] concluded that the model \nwas accurate\
    \ in predicting water movement from aquifers, \ndrainage and supply systems, and\
    \ land surfaces across an \nAustralian watershed with a complex hydro-geological\
    \ re-\ngime. Overall, Singh et al. [227] showed that the model can \nbe utilized\
    \ for irrigation planning and management of water \nresources for agricultural\
    \ purposes.  \nMany of the MIKE SHE applications also involve cou-\npling with\
    \ other models; the model can interface with Model \nof Urban Sewers (MOUSE) to\
    \ simulate the effect of urban \ndrainage and sewer systems on the surface/subsurface\
    \ hy-\ndrology [34, 228, 229] and is also frequently coupled with \n(DAISY), a\
    \ detailed soil-plant-atmosphere model for agricul-\nture related studies [34,\
    \ 230, 231]. Like the GSSHA model, \nMIKE SHE faces the problem of being computationally\
    \ in-\ntensive and may be prohibitive for medium to large-sized \nwatersheds [171].\
    \ Borah and Bera [5] further point out that \nthe physically based flow-governing\
    \ equations use approxi-\nmate numerical solutions, which are subject to computational\
    \ \ninstability problems, and limited on space and time incre-\nments and watershed\
    \ sizes. \nPrecipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)/Modular \nModeling System\
    \ (MMS) \nPRMS [232] is a modular-design, deterministic, distrib-\nuted model\
    \ that simulates precipitation- and snowmelt-\ndriven movement of water through\
    \ the watershed via over-\nland flow, interflow, and baseflow. Watershed response\
    \ can \nbe simulated at a daily time step or more frequently over the \ncourse\
    \ of a storm. The watershed is divided into sub-units \nbased on basin characteristics\
    \ such as slope, aspect, eleva-\ntion, vegetation type, soil type, land use, and\
    \ precipitation \ndistribution. Two levels of partitioning are available for \n\
    PRMS. The first divides the basin into HRUs based on the \nbasin characteristics\
    \ where water and energy balances are \ncomputed daily for each HRU; the sum of\
    \ the responses of \nall HRU's, weighted on a unit-area basis, produces the daily\
    \ \nsystem response and streamflow for a basin. A second level \nWatershed Modeling\
    \ and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    39 \nof\
    \ partitioning is available for storm hydrograph simulation \nwhere the watershed\
    \ is conceptualized as a series of inter-\nconnected flow planes and channel segments.\
    \ Surface runoff \nis routed over the flow planes into the channel segments and\
    \ \nchannel flow is routed through the watershed channel sys-\ntem. A HRU can\
    \ be considered the equivalent of a flow \nplane or it can be delineated into\
    \ a number of flow planes \n[232, 233]. PRMS was redesigned and now forms the\
    \ basis \nof the US Geological Society (USGS) Modular Modeling \nSystem (MMS)\
    \ [232].  \nPRMS [233] has been applied in different regions around \nthe world.\
    \ Applications range from the investigation of se-\nlected process components\
    \ to streamflow simulation and the \nintegration of MMS with other models [234].\
    \ One of the \nmajor benefits of MMS is its support for the integration of \n\
    models and tools at a variety of levels [232]. Design levels \ninclude individual\
    \ process models, tightly coupled models, \nloosely coupled models, and fully\
    \ integrated decision sup-\nport systems [234]. Several studies [235-237] have\
    \ focused \non this aspect of the model with some success. Steuer and \nHunt [236]\
    \ and Hunt and Steuer [235] used the model to \nstudy the effects of urbanization\
    \ and land use changes on \nground water recharge, and explicitly fed the results\
    \ into the \nU.S. Geologic Survey groundwater model, Modular Three-\nDimensional\
    \ \nFinite-Difference \nGround-Water \nFlow \nModel(MODFLOW), for other studies\
    \ in Dane County, Wis-\nconsin. Hobson [237] coupled the model with a stochastic\
    \ \nweather generator as a framework to simulate weather vari-\nables and streamflows\
    \ in the Upper Truckee River Basin on \nthe California and Nevada border. The\
    \ model can also be \neffectively used to evaluate the effects of climate variability,\
    \ \nchange on water resources, water management [234], and \nsimulate floods including\
    \ the representing flood wave propa-\ngation from single rainfall events [5].\
    \ Valeo and Xiang [238] \ndemonstrated this capability by analyzing climate change\
    \ \nimpacts on flooding from the Elbow River watershed in the \nfoothills of the\
    \ Rocky Mountains. In addition, Yates et al. \n[239] utilized the model with historical\
    \ radar rainfall and \nforecast data to simulate flash flooding on a watershed\
    \ that \nwas partially burned during a forest fire. Other examples of \nthese\
    \ studies were conducted in several regions of the world, \nincluding the Main\
    \ Ethiopian Rift Valley [240], river basins \nin the Sierra Nevada of California\
    \ [241], and the Arno River \nin Italy [242]. \nBorah and Bera [5] identified\
    \ the following key weak-\nnesses of PRMS/MMS: (i) like KINEROS2, the model was\
    \ \ndesigned for single rainfall events using one-dimensional \nflow equations\
    \ and has potential numerical problems inher-\nent to the numerical solutions;\
    \ (ii) in the Storm Mode, the \nmodel has hydrology and overland sediment, but\
    \ no chemi-\ncal component, sediment simulation in stream channels, and \nsubsurface\
    \ flow simulations; and (iii) the physically based \nflow-governing equations\
    \ use approximate numerical solu-\ntions which are subject to computational instability\
    \ prob-\nlems, and limited on space and time increments and water-\nshed sizes.\
    \ \nSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) \nSWAT [35, 36] is a physically-based,\
    \ continuous-time \nwatershed model that operates on a daily time step and is\
    \ \ndesigned to predict the impact of management on water, \nsediment, and agricultural\
    \ chemical yields in ungauged wa-\ntersheds. The watershed is divided into multiple\
    \ subwater-\nsheds, which are then further subdivided into HRUs that \nconsist\
    \ of homogeneous land use, management, and soil \ncharacteristics. The HRUs represent\
    \ percentages of the sub-\nwatershed area and are not identified spatially within\
    \ a \nSWAT simulation. Alternatively, a watershed can only be \nsubdivided into\
    \ subwatersheds that are characterized by \ndominant land use, soil type, and\
    \ management. Output for \nthe model includes evapotranspiration, soil water storage,\
    \ \nand water yield (surface runoff plus subsurface flow) [35, \n36]. The model\
    \ has been adopted as part of the USEPA’s \nBetter Assessment Science Integrating\
    \ Point and Nonpoint \nSources (BASINS) system [243] and AGWA [210, 211] \nsoftware\
    \ systems because it is a widely accepted continuous \nmodel suitable for agricultural\
    \ and forest land uses [5, 168]. \nBased on these core strengths, Gassman et al.\
    \ [36] found that \nthe primary applications of SWAT are calibration and/or \n\
    sensitivity analysis, climate change impacts, GIS interface \ndescriptions, hydrologic\
    \ assessments, variation in configura-\ntion or data input effects, comparisons\
    \ with other models or \ntechniques, interfaces with other models, and pollutant\
    \ as-\nsessments. The foundation strength of SWAT in many of \nthese applications\
    \ is the combination of simplified upland \nand channel processes that are incorporated\
    \ into the model \nnoted by Gassman et al. [36]. The incorporation of the CN \n\
    method and non-spatial HRUs supports model adaptation to \nvirtually any watershed\
    \ with a wide variety of hydrologic \nconditions [36].  \nSWAT has produced favorable\
    \ model results when \nevaluated on watersheds with a range of conditions in the\
    \ \nU.S. and many other countries such as Korea [244], Canada \n[245], China [246],\
    \ Finland [247], India [248-250], Tunisia \n[251], and Greece [252]; across many\
    \ of these watersheds, \nSWAT has shown flexibility in simulating surface runoff.\
    \ \nFor example, Du et al. [253] demonstrated that a modified \nversion of the\
    \ SWAT model was able to generate reasonable \nsimulation results for surface\
    \ and subsurface flows, water \ntable dynamics, tile flow, potholes, surface tile\
    \ inlets, and \naeration stress on plants for large flat landscapes. Gebremes-\n\
    kel et al. [245] stated that the SWAT model performed very \nwell for stream flow\
    \ prediction in the Canagagigue Creek \nwatershed of southwestern Ontario, Canada.\
    \ Several studies \nhave also demonstrated the utility of SWAT as a tool for \n\
    evaluating how stream flow can be affected by climate \nchange [254-256]. \nWith\
    \ a flexible framework, SWAT facilitates the calcula-\ntion of TMDLs and simulation\
    \ of a wide variety of conserva-\ntion practices and other BMPs (e.g., fertilizer\
    \ and manure \napplication rate and timing, irrigation management, and \nflood\
    \ prevention structures) [36]. Several studies illustrate \nthe success of SWAT\
    \ in conducting these types of simula-\ntions as part of an overall BMP assessment.\
    \ For example, \nSanthi et al. [257] were able to use SWAT to determine the \n\
    impacts of manure and nutrient related BMPs, forage harvest \nmanagement, and\
    \ other BMPs on water quality in the West \nFork watershed in Texas. Chaplot et\
    \ al.’s [258] efforts with \nSWAT showed that the adoption of no tillage, changes\
    \ in \nnitrogen application rates, and land use changes had the po-\ntential to\
    \ significantly affect nitrogen losses on the Walnut \nCreek watershed in Iowa,\
    \ and Kang et al. [244] were suc-\ncessful in predicting and evaluating TMDLs\
    \ of total nitro-\n40    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et\
    \ al. \ngen, total phosphorus, and suspended solid for a small water-\nshed containing\
    \ rice paddies.  \nSWAT possesses components that make it a robust tool \nfor\
    \ simulating in-stream water quality dynamics, bacteria \nfate and transport,\
    \ and sediment transport [36]. A study con-\nducted by Migliaccio et al. [259]\
    \ compared SWAT’s in-\nstream water quality component with QUAL2E, USEPA’s \n\
    well-known and state-of-the-art in-stream water quality \nmodel. Both options\
    \ were used to simulate the movement of \ntotal phosphorous (P) and nitrate/nitrite\
    \ (N) movement on \nWar Eagle Creek watershed in Arkansas. The study revealed\
    \ \nthat there was no statistical difference between both in-\nstream water quality\
    \ modeling options. Saleh and Du [209] \nand Stewart et al. [260] also show that\
    \ SWAT predicted rea-\nsonable results for P and N loss on the Bosque River water-\n\
    shed in Texas. Chu et al. [261] evaluated SWAT on the \nWarner Creek watershed\
    \ in Maryland and generated simula-\ntion results for sediment loads which agreed\
    \ strongly with \nyearly measured values. Other studies [248, 250, 262-265] \n\
    on SWAT simulation of sediment loading on different water-\nsheds also generated\
    \ comparable results. In Missouri, for \nexample, Benham et al. [266] used SWAT\
    \ to determine the \nbacteria sources and assess which BMPs can reduce the bac-\n\
    teria on a watershed in Missouri. Similar results [267, 268] \nfrom other studies\
    \ also highlight the usefulness of SWAT in \nbacteria fate and transport.  \n\
    The examples presented here have highlighted the flexi-\nbility and robustness\
    \ of SWAT. Despite these strengths, \nSWAT possesses a number of weaknesses, notably\
    \ the use of \nnon-spatial aspects of HRUs [6, 36]. As a result, Gassman et \n\
    al. [36] note that this does not allow SWAT to provide an \nexplicit spatial representation\
    \ of riparian buffer zones, wet-\nlands, and other BMPs. In addition, there is\
    \ limited ability to \naccount for targeted placement of grassland or other land\
    \ use \nand ignore flow and pollutant routing within a given subwa-\ntershed.\
    \ Like ANPS and AnnANPS, SWAT also utilizes the \ncurve number (CN) method and\
    \ faces the same limitations \nidentified earlier by Beven [186-188]. Borah and\
    \ Bera [171] \nalso report that SWAT does not simulate single-event storms \n\
    adequately.  \nWater Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) \nWEPP [269] is a process-based,\
    \ distributed, continuous, \nerosion prediction model. It is applicable to hillslope\
    \ erosion \nprocesses (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the \n\
    hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. The \nprimary intention\
    \ of the model is to evaluate the effects of \nfarming and land use on soil erosion\
    \ and sediment delivery \nfor small, agricultural field-sized watersheds (up to\
    \ 2.59x106 \nm2). WEPP has been used in a wide range of applications, \nincluding\
    \ runoff mapping [270], sediment analysis [271], \nand modeling the transport\
    \ of pathogenic microorganisms \n[272]. Another example of the WEPP application\
    \ was fo-\ncused on the connection between soil sediment and microbial \ntransport\
    \ [272]. It was determined that areas with clay soils \ncontribute more to contamination\
    \ of water supplies by mi-\ncroorganisms than those with sandy soils. It was also\
    \ sug-\ngested that the leading factors are hydraulic conductivity, \nrainfall\
    \ intensity, and topographic slope. Similar efforts \ncould be performed on organic\
    \ chemicals that may adhere to \ndiffering soil types and be transported through\
    \ the watershed. \nA computer interface (Erosion Database Interface, EDI) \nwas\
    \ created by van Lier et al. [273] to process the surface \nhydrology output from\
    \ WEPP into a georeferenced estima-\ntion of runoff. This tool allowed for improved\
    \ management \nof agriculture and can be used to assess crop management \ntechniques\
    \ [270]. WEPP was used, along with the Universal \nSoil Loss Equation, sediment\
    \ rating curves, and other model-\ning techniques to develop a sediment budget\
    \ for the Murder-\nCreekBasin in Georgia. From the study, researchers found \n\
    that unstable streambanks, mobile streambeds, and turbidity \ncurrently observed\
    \ in the area were the result of poor farm-\ning practices from the early 1900s\
    \ [271].  \nWATERSHED MODELING SYSTEMS \nThere are numerous watershed-scale hydrologic\
    \ model-\ning systems available that utilize some of the models men-\ntioned previously\
    \ within one packaged system for watershed \nmanagement. This section briefly\
    \ describes some of the sys-\ntems more commonly used today. A summary of the\
    \ water-\nshed model systems considered and their properties is pro-\nvided in\
    \ Table 2. \nAutomated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool \n(AGWA) \nAGWA is\
    \ a GIS-based tool for watershed modeling cre-\nated through a joint project between\
    \ the USDA-ARS South-\nwest Watershed Research Center and the U.S. EPA Office\
    \ of \nResearch and Development [274]. Embedded in AGWA are \nthe KINEROS and\
    \ SWAT models. Digital elevation models \n(DEMs) are used to delineate and discretize\
    \ the watersheds. \nThen, soil, land cover, and precipitation data layers are\
    \ used \nto derive model input parameters. Subsurface hydrologic \ndata from Walnut\
    \ Gulch Experimental Watershed were used \nto calibrate and validate AGWA.  \n\
    AGWA is used by scientists and natural resource manag-\ners to investigate the\
    \ impacts of land cover change on runoff, \nerosion, and water quality. Most applications\
    \ of AGWA in-\nvolve analysis of future sediment loading and runoff to assist\
    \ \nin decision support. Hernandez et al. [214] demonstrated this \napplication\
    \ by using AGWA with ATtILA, a landscape as-\nsessment tool, to analyze the spatial\
    \ effects of human-\ninduced landscape changes on runoff volume and soil ero-\n\
    sion in the San Pedro River Basin, a semi-arid area. Within \nAGWA, SWAT was used\
    \ for modeling of runoff and erosion \nsimulations. The basin was divided into\
    \ sub catchments for \nanalysis, which were further divided into hydrological\
    \ re-\nsponse units (HRUs) to develop relationships between land \ncover and sediment\
    \ yield. Agricultural areas were found to \nhave the greatest contribution to\
    \ sediment yield. Subcatch-\nments and HRUs were ranked in order of sediment loading\
    \ \nwith those contributing the most sediment considered “sensi-\ntive areas.”\
    \ This application provides resource managers \nwith capability to identify problem\
    \ areas by applying a spa-\ntial approach to sediment and runoff modeling [214].\
    \ An-\nother example of AGWA’s use for management decision \nsupport was performed\
    \ by Kepner et al. [275]. Three scenar-\nios for future urbanization of the Upper\
    \ San Pedro River \nBasin were evaluated for surface runoff, sediment yield, \n\
    channel discharge, and percolation using SWAT within \nAGWA. While all three scenarios\
    \ yielded negative impacts \non the basin, the Open Scenario, which consists of\
    \ a popula-\ntion increase greater than currently forecasted and highly \nWatershed\
    \ Modeling and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5  \
    \  41 \nunrestricted land development, resulted in a worst case out-\ncome [275].\
    \ Similar applications can be employed to assist \nstakeholders and management\
    \ in decision support for land \ndevelopment planning. \nBetter Assessment Science\
    \ Integrating Point and Non-\npoint Sources (BASINS) \nFirst released in 1996\
    \ by the USEPA, the Better Assess-\nment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint\
    \ Sources (BA-\nSINS) software system was intended to serve as a multipur-\npose\
    \ environmental analysis system focused on evaluating \nboth point and nonpoint\
    \ sources of pollutant loading in wa-\ntersheds [211]. A specific intended use\
    \ of BASINS is fo-\ncused on evaluation and development of Total Maximum \nDaily\
    \ Loads (TMDLs). It is capable of performing watershed \nand water quality-based\
    \ studies on regional, state, and local \nlevels. The system includes utilities\
    \ for data management \nand extraction, watershed delineation, watershed assessment\
    \ \ntools, and a group of watershed models including WinHSPF, \nPollutant Load\
    \ Application (PLOAD), Aquatic Ecostystem \nand Toxicity Model (AQUATOX), and\
    \ AGWA which in-\ncludes KINEROS and SWAT. The current version, BASINS \n4.0,\
    \ includes an open-source, free GIS software architecture, \nMapWindow [276].\
    \  \nBASINS has been used for pollutant loading of the Sea-\nmangeum watershed\
    \ in Korea, specifically focused on BOD, \ntotal nitrogen, and total phosphorous.\
    \ Jeon et al. [277], in \ntesting the applicability of WinHSPF within BASINS,\
    \ found \nthat values obtained from BASINS were a bit higher than \nfield observations,\
    \ but were considered within an acceptable \nrange to accept the model as a good\
    \ choice for Korean appli-\ncations. In another study for the New York Department\
    \ of \nEnvironment and Conservation (NYDEC), BASINS was \nconsidered for use in\
    \ development of the sediment portion of \nthe state’s TMDL plan. They found that\
    \ SWAT was easier to \nuse than HSPF, but recommend that Monte Carlo simula-\n\
    tions be conducted to provide more accurate values [278]. \nBoth studies indicated\
    \ that results were less than perfect, but \nwithin acceptable boundaries.  \n\
    MODFLOW-Watershed \nHydrology \nand \nTransport \n(MODFLOW-WHaT) \nMODFLOW-WHaT\
    \ is a recent addition to the watershed \nmodeling portfolio. The system is the\
    \ result of a Master’s \nThesis research of Brad Thoms [256], where the Center\
    \ for \nGroundwater Research at Oregon Health and Science Uni-\nversity currently\
    \ sponsors/maintains MODLFLOW-WHAT. \nThe package provides fully coupled, 3D simulation\
    \ of sur-\nface-subsurface interactions through use of Richard’s Equa-\ntion,\
    \ 2D kinematic flow approximations for overland flow, \nand an adaptive time-stepping\
    \ algorithm. Open-channel flow \ncalculations are performed using Diffusion Analogy\
    \ Surface-\nWater Flow Model (DAFLOW) with water quality modeled \nusing RT3D\
    \ and Branched Lagrangian Transport Model \n(BLTM) [279].  \nLittle is known about\
    \ the benefits of using the system be-\nyond the comparison made by Thoms [280]\
    \ to work done by \nJohnson and colleagues [281]. Johnson’s work involved us-\n\
    ing MODFLOW-SURFACT to evaluate the impacts of daily \nprecipitation and location\
    \ within a watershed on the occur-\nrence of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) in\
    \ groundwaters of \nsemi-arid regions [281]. In the between the two MODFLOW \n\
    packages, it was found that MODFLOW-WHaT more accu-\nrately represented the watershed’s\
    \ responses to precipitation \nevents by taking into consideration infiltration\
    \ and subsur-\nface flow that are not well represented in MODFLOW-\nSURFACT [280].\
    \ The authors are unaware of a GIS compo-\nnent to this modeling system or other\
    \ applications. \nWatershed Information System (WISE) \nDeveloped by Watershed\
    \ Concepts, WISE is a GIS-based \nsystem to manage and analyze large amounts of\
    \ water re-\nsources data. The system is primarily used for its open data \nstorage\
    \ management and formatting abilities instead of actu-\nally processing information\
    \ [282]. It is compatible with \nHEC-1, HEC-2, HEC-RAS, FLO-2D, Coastal Hydroscience\
    \ \nAnalysis, Modeling & Predictive Simulation (CHAMPS), \nWave Height Analysis\
    \ for Flood Insurance Studies \n(WHAFIS), Storm Water Management Model (SWMM),\

    \ \n• Scoping module: This allows users to collect spatial \ndata and assists\

    \ and piping systems.  \n• Open system inventory module: Used for large scale\
    \ \nhydrologic and hydraulic studies, this module allows \ninput of Total Station\
    \ survey data and provides easy \nexport to the HEC-RAS model.  \n• Hydrology\
    \ module: This module assists in catchment \ndelineation and calculates Time of\
    \ Concentration, \nstage/storage curves and SCS curve numbers. It also \ncan function\
    \ as a pre-processor for HEC-1 and TR-20 \nmodels.  \n• Hydraulics module: Spatial\
    \ data can be integrated to \nbuild hydraulic model input data and is used for\
    \ flood \nmap generation. \n• Water \nquality \nmodule: \nTravel \ntime \nof \n\
    spills/contamination events is computed using dis-\ntance or time interval measures\
    \ and impacted stream \nsegments are color coded. \n• Planning tools module: Aerial\
    \ photos can be used to \nidentify impervious surfaces which are then used to\
    \ \nestimate impact based upon parcel ownership. \n• Wastewater planning module:\
    \ Users can plan and pre-\ndict costs associated with modifying or repairing ex-\n\
    isting wastewater systems or model new systems tak-\ning into consideration costs\
    \ and population projections \n[283]. \nWISE has been used primarily as a flood\
    \ hazard mapping \ntool. USGS New Hapmshire/Vermont Water Science Center \nperformed\
    \ such a study for Carroll County, New Hampshire \n[284], where WISE was primarily\
    \ used for data collection \nand storage. The primary problems faced by those\
    \ involved \n42    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al.\
    \ \nin the project included lack of or low quality spatial data for \nmapping\
    \ the floodplains [284].  \nWatershed Modeling System (WMS) \nWatershed Modeling\
    \ System (WMS), developed by En-\nvironmental Modeling Systems, Inc. at Brigham\
    \ Young Uni-\nversity, is a comprehensive graphical modeling environment \nfor\
    \ all phases of watershed hydrology and hydraulics [197]. \nWMS includes powerful\
    \ tools to automate modeling proc-\nesses such as automated basin delineation,\
    \ geometric pa-\nrameter calculations, GIS overlay computations including \ncurve\
    \ numbers (CN), rainfall depth, roughness coefficients, \netc., and cross-section\
    \ extraction from terrain data. WMS \nprovides an interface for a variety of hydrologic\
    \ and hydrau-\nlic models within a GIS-based processing framework. Mod-\nels packaged\
    \ within the system include HEC-1, TR-20, TR-\n55, National Flood Frequency Model\
    \ (NFF), Modified Ra-\ntional Method Model (MODRAT), OC Rational, and HSPF \n\
    as hydrologic modeling components. HEC-RAS, Simplified \nDam-Break Model (SMPDBK),\
    \ and CE QUAL W2 provide \nhydraulic modeling capabilities. Gridded Surface Subsurface\
    \ \nHydraulic Analysis (GSSHA), a runoff and infiltration \nmodel from the U.S.\
    \ Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nEngineering and Research Development Center\
    \ (ERDC), is \nalso included for 2-D integrated hydrology modeling with \ngroundwater\
    \ interactions. Additional calculations include use \nof the rational method to\
    \ compute peak flows primarily for \nsmall rural watersheds [197]. \nTypical applications\
    \ involve use of the sub-models \nwithin WMS with the overarching system used\
    \ for pre- and \npost-processing of information. An example of this is the \n\
    work done by Omer et al. [214] on evaluating the impact of \ndata resolution on\
    \ hydraulic modeling and floodplain de-\nlineation for Leith Creek in North Carolina.\
    \ Light detection \nand ranging (LIDAR) data is a highly dense but a highly \n\
    informational aerial surveying technique now being em-\nployed in GIS and hydrology\
    \ applications for actions such as \ndelineating catchments and floodplains. Redundancy\
    \ in the \ndata and the massive amounts of data obtained can be trou-\nblesome.\
    \ WMS possesses capabilities to not only utilize this \ndata in applications,\
    \ but also to filter the data to remove un-\nnecessary points. The researchers\
    \ filtered the LIDAR data at \ndifferent levels and then compared HEC-RAS results\
    \ using \neach of the filtered data sets. WMS provided a platform for \nperforming\
    \ the analysis. It was found that filtering of the \ndata improved processing\
    \ time without compromising results \nwith the optimal filter level of at degrees\
    \ [285].  \nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN WATERSHED MOD-\nELING \nWatershed modeling\
    \ involves a comprehensive examina-\ntion of contaminant transport across different\
    \ features found \non the surface and in the subsurface, including the interfaces\
    \ \nbetween. Specific research and advances are focused on sub-\ncomponents of\
    \ watershed modeling. Other areas for future \nconsideration include development\
    \ of guidelines for discern-\ning minimum data resolution requirements, improved\
    \ under-\nstanding of scale-up issues and relationships, and develop-\nment of\
    \ threshold area guidelines for stream network devel-\nopment. Horn et al. [286]\
    \ also suggest that future advance-\nments should include additional capabilities\
    \ to evaluate river \nwater quality such as biological interactions (beyond that\
    \ \ncurrently done for TMDLs]. Research is currently underway \nto address several\
    \ of these needs in watershed modeling. A \nfew notable examples are illustrated\
    \ below.  \nThe U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers\
    \ (USACE) have conducted several re-\nsearch projects on improving watershed and\
    \ related model-\ning including improvements in the capabilities of existing \n\
    models. For example, the USACE Great Lakes Tributary \nModeling Program is developing\
    \ sediment transport models \nfor Great Lakes tributaries [287]. USACE has committed\
    \ to \ndeveloping more of these sediment transport models for \nother Great Lakes\
    \ tributaries [287]. USACE also intends to \ndevelop web-based tools that can\
    \ continue to support water-\nshed planning at smaller tributaries and sub-basins.\
    \ This di-\nrection can potentially lead to the application of sub models \nin\
    \ a more flexible format such as integration with Internet \nGIS tools. Research\
    \ at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nCoastal Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL) is\
    \ also developing \nimproved sub-models. For example, parameter estimation \n\
    methodologies are being used to enhance existing HEC-\nHMS automated parameter\
    \ estimation capabilities [288]. \nAdditional research is also being done to investigate\
    \ the use \nof artificial neural networks for forecasting streamflows and \nrainfall-runoff\
    \ on watersheds [12, 16, 289, 290]. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe ability to deliver reliable\
    \ water resources to a grow-\ning population and effectively forecast flooding,\
    \ drought, \nand surface/groundwater water contamination represent in-\ncreasingly\
    \ difficult and interrelated challenges to water re-\nsource managers, engineers,\
    \ and researchers. Such chal-\nlenges necessitate the employment of a more holistic\
    \ ap-\nproach that is capable of examining individual processes and \nsystems\
    \ and the interface between them. This paper identi-\nfied and reviewed current\
    \ technologies and issues involved \nwith performing hydrologic modeling at the\
    \ watershed scale. \nThe topics presented include an observed shift to a more\
    \ \nholistic, watershed-based focus of the regulatory community, \nvarious types\
    \ of watershed-scale models and watershed \nmodeling systems available today,\
    \ use of artificial intelli-\ngence in modeling processes, and issues faced through\
    \ scale-\nup of hydrologic processes and data resolution. The benefits \nof using\
    \ these techniques include the ability to assist water \nresource and watershed\
    \ managers with a variety of applica-\ntions such as evaluating and developing\
    \ TMDLs. Tables 1 \nand 2 provide a summary of watershed-scale models and \nmodeling\
    \ systems reviewed in this paper. Water resource \nmanagers and decision makers\
    \ can employ this summary to \ncompare models and also use as a screening tool\
    \ for select-\ning a watershed model for a specific purpose.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\
    \ affordable digital data infrastructure;\ntechnology assist in smallholder data\
    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n3 of 31\nSection 3 discusses relevant approaches to data collection in\
    \ smallholder agriculture.\nWith these, we aim to layout a better insight of the\
    \ target population and bring about\nthe data gaps that needs to be ﬁlled. The\
    \ literature search methodology is explained in\nSection 4. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture,\nbased on reviewed literature\
    \ and a high-level system architecture are presented in Section 5.\nDiscussion\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework as a standard [57]. The use of IoT and WSN\
    \ for\nagricultural applications was insigniﬁcant until around 2010 and has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsince then. Hence, we searched for publications in the years 2011–2021.\
    \ Research articles,\nsoftware and data publications, white papers and conference\

    \ Next, results were ﬁltered using the exclusion criteria mentioned in Table 1.\
    \ A ﬁrst\nlevel discrimination was based on the paper’s type, followed by title\

    \ technicality, usability and deployment environment.\nSome 53 papers were found\
    \ relevant to our study, of which about 50% were in con-\nference proceedings.\
    \ Further analysis was carried out on these papers to understand the\nhardware\
    \ and technical details. Sensors and nodes used in the work, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, power sources and energy harvesting schemes, micro-controllers and transceivers\n\
    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\

  analysis: 'ERA5 single levels have higher accuracies in reproducing the air temperature
    estimates as well as relative humidity when compared to ERA5-L reanalysis data,
    while ERA5-L performs slightly better in solar radiation and u10, respectively,
    especially under "C" climate type conditions. However, all variables analyzed
    have lower accuracies in estimating the variables discussed in “B” climate zones
    when ERA5 is used. In addition, the accuracy of the reanalysis products was strongly
    connected with the climatic conditions rather than the topographic distribution
    of the selected study sites.


    Generally, the accuracy of the reanalysis datasets in predicting the remaining
    variables decreases from fall and winter seasons to spring and summer seasons,
    with the lowest performances observed in the latter. Intermediate performance
    was observed under "Cfa" climate zones. These findings suggest that the accuracy
    of the reanalyses products is strongly connected with the climatic conditions
    rather than the topographic distribution of the selected study sites.'

    • The air temperature estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis predictions.
    • Climate reanalysis provided reliable reference evapotranspiration estimates.
    • Different performances were obtained by ERA5 and ERA5-L for some variables.
    • The accuracy of the reanalysis products was influenced by the climatic conditions.
    Abstract Study region The study region is represented by seven irrigation districts
    distributed under different climate and topography conditions in Italy. Study
    focus This study explores the reliability and consistency of the global ERA5 single
    levels and ERA5-Land reanalysis datasets in predicting the main agrometeorological
    estimates commonly used for crop water requirements calculation. In particular,
    the reanalysis data was compared, variable-by-variable (e.g., solar radiation,
    Rs; air temperature, Tair; relative humidity, RH; wind speed, u10; reference evapotranspiration,
    ET0), with in situ agrometeorological observations obtained from 66 automatic
    weather stations (2008–2020). In addition, the presence of a climate-dependency
    on their accuracy was assessed at the different irrigation districts. New hydrological
    insights for the region A general good agreement was obtained between observed
    and reanalysis agrometeorological variables at both daily and seasonal scales.
    The best performance was obtained for Tair, followed by RH, Rs, and u10 for both
    reanalysis datasets, especially under temperate climate conditions. These performances
    were translated into slightly higher accuracy of ET0 estimates by ERA5-Land product,
    confirming the potential of using reanalysis datasets as an alternative data source
    for retrieving the ET0 and overcoming the unavailability of observed agrometeorological
    data. Graphical Abstract Download : Download high-res image (208KB) Download :

    simulationWater managementIrrigation 1. Introduction The quantitative estimation
    of the evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes exchanged within the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum is a precondition for rational irrigation scheduling, crop yield forecasting,
    and hydrological modelling applications (Hupet and Vanclooster, 2001). Nowadays,
    the crop reference ET (ET0) formulation, proposed by Penman-Monteith (P-M) and
    popularized by the FAO-56 paper as a reference methodology for calculating crop
    water requirements (Allen et al., 1998), is still largely used for practical purposes
    (Pereira et al., 2015). The use of the P-M approach calls for the necessity of
    having a reliable and complete set of site-specific agrometeorological data. In
    fact, the P-M approach calculates the ET0 for a standard surface, requiring a
    complete set of ground-based agrometeorological data, such as the air temperature
    (Tair), the wind speed (u2), the solar radiation (Rs), and the relative humidity
    (RH), to parameterize the surface and aerodynamic resistances. Commonly, agrometeorological
    variables are measured by automatic weather stations. Their data integrity is
    ensured by proper data quality assessment and control procedures (De Pauw et al.,
    2000). However, ground-based observations could be affected by several errors,
    mainly due to the sensor properties, such as their accuracy, settings, instrument
    drift or temporal data sampling frequency (Beven, 1979, Hupet and Vanclooster,
    2001, Meyer et al., 1989). Other shortcomings are related to the agrometeorological
    time-series consistency. The time series can suffer from substantial time gaps
    (Capra et al., 2013) and often protocols for correcting and/or estimating poor
    quality or missing data need to be applied (see, e.g., Pereira et al., 2015).
    Moreover, the agrometeorological data representativeness of well-watered conditions
    needs to be checked before implementing them in the ET0 approach (Pereira et al.,
    2015). Despite the utmost importance of observed agrometeorological data for agriculture
    purposes, the agrometeorological networks are often sparse over the territory,
    especially in arid zones (De Pauw et al., 2000). Sometimes, data access is another
    critical point for end-users because data is managed and distributed by different
    regional services at the National level (Pelosi et al., 2021). To compensate for
    the lack of spatial and temporal distributed information, other weather data sources
    have steadily developed, such as the use of interpolation methods from gauge-based
    observations, the adoption of satellite-based datasets, or the creation of gridded
    datasets obtained by adjusting the spatial interpolation estimates with satellite
    observations (Pelosi et al., 2020). Moreover, during the last century, great advances
    have been reached in agrometeorological data forecasting using global and regional
    numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Several studies have already exploited
    their potential for supporting sustainable irrigation management (e.g. Negm et
    al., 2017; Chirico et al., 2018; Longo- Minnolo et al., 2020; Medina et al., 2018;
    Pelosi et al., 2016; Vanella et al., 2020). As an example, Vanella et al. (2020)
    showed that the use of forecast agrometeorological estimates provided by the Consortium
    for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO, http://www.cosmo-model.org) opens promising
    perspectives for assessing the ET0 in different agriculture contexts, particularly
    under conditions of water scarcity, instead than using past agrometeorological
    data. Besides the NWP models, the use of atmospheric reanalysis is another alternative
    weather data source. Atmospheric reanalysis has generated increasing interest
    in the recent decade, due to its ability to provide complete and consistent time-series
    of multiple meteorological parameters at a global scale by covering several decades
    (Tarek et al., 2020). From a theoretical point of view, the reanalysis process
    is a retrospective analysis of past historical data. This process makes use of
    the ever-increasing computational resources, recent versions of NWP models and
    assimilation schemes. In general, the reanalysis approaches assimilate a wide
    array of atmospheric and ocean measured and remotely sensed information within
    a dynamical–physical coupled numerical model (Poli et al., 2016). One of the recognized
    advantages of using reanalysis approaches is that their outputs are not directly
    dependent on the density of ground-based observational networks. Thus they have
    the potential to provide variables in areas with little and/or no surface coverage
    (Tarek et al., 2020). Moreover, Pelosi et al. (2020) reported that reanalysis
    data can represent an efficient data source for planning and design studies applied
    to irrigation water management. Currently, several modelling centres provide reanalysis
    products at variable spatial and temporal scales (Lindsay et al., 2014, Chaudhuri
    et al., 2013). As an example, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
    (ECMWF) periodically applies its forecast models and data assimilation systems
    to reanalyse archived observations for generating global data sets describing
    the recent history of the atmosphere, land surface, and oceans. The latest released
    ECMWF reanalysis products are ERA5 single levels (ERA5) and ERA5 Land (ERA5-L),
    which are being produced within the Copernicus Climate Change Service and freely
    distributed since 2019. The first dataset, ERA5, covers the entire globe from
    1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km (depending on latitude). The second
    dataset, ERA5-L, has been produced by replaying the land component of the ERA5
    climate reanalysis, with a horizontal spatial resolution of 9 km. Specifically,
    ERA5-L uses air temperature (Tair), air humidity and air pressure, in a process
    of atmospheric forcing, as input to control the simulated land fields. These atmospheric
    variables are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid
    of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-L (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019).
    A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art associated with the use of ERA5-L
    for land and environmental applications is presented by Muñoz-Sabater et al. (2021).
    They demonstrated the added value of ERA5-L reanalysis products, in comparison
    to ERA-Interim and ERA5, for estimating a wide range of in situ observations,
    even if they have not evaluated the performance of the reanalysis products in
    predicting ET fluxes. The specific objective of this study was to explore the
    effectiveness of using the most advanced global ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA5 single
    levels and ERA5-L) as a potential data source for predicting the main agrometeorological
    variables and estimating the ET0 in different climate contexts within the Italian
    territory, at daily and seasonal scales. In addition, visual Geographic Information
    System (GIS) based user-friendly tools have been developed in this study for guiding
    the users in the reanalyses data pre-processing steps. 2. Materials and methods
    The methodological approach proposed in this study was carried out in the framework
    of the research project INtegrated Computer modeling and monitoring for Irrigation
    Planning in Italy (INCIPIT). The general aim of the INCIPIT project is to identify
    a shared set of modelling tools and monitoring techniques for the assessment of
    irrigation water uses in seven irrigation districts distributed over the Italian
    territory. In this context, time series of daily values of the agrometeorological
    variables registered in 66 weather stations, referred to as the INCIPIT irrigation
    districts (Table 1 and Fig. 1), were collected. The use of the new generation
    ECMWF reanalysis datasets was then evaluated in comparison to the retrieved ground-based
    agrometeorological data for the ET0 estimation. Table 1. Denominations and locations

    full-size image Fig. 1. Location of the weather stations selected over the investigated
    irrigation districts within the Italian peninsula: (1) Lombardy; (2) Emilia-Romagna;
    (3) Campania; (4) Apulia; (5) Sardinia; and (6) Sicily (Eastern and Western sides).
    2.1. Ground-based agrometeorological variables at the study sites The observed
    agrometeorological data was acquired on a daily scale from 66 weather stations
    located in six different Italian administrative regions (Campania, Emilia-Romagna,
    Lombardy, Apulia, Sardinia, and Sicily), within the reference period 2008–2020
    (from January 1st 2008 to December 31st 2020). Due to the trans-regional component
    of this study, the observed agrometeorological data were provided from multiple
    ground-based sources managed by different Regional meteorological agencies located
    in each of the irrigation districts of interest (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The set
    of agrometeorological variables under investigation was composed of solar radiation
    (Rs, W m-2), maximum and minimum Tair measured at 2 m (°C), maximum and minimum
    relative humidity (RH, %), wind speed measured at 2 m (u2, m s-1) and 10 m (u10,
    m s-1), respectively, and ET0 estimates calculated with the P-M approach (mm d-1).
    The selection of the weather stations was based on a twofold criterion. Firstly,
    they were identified by setting a maximum distance (50 km) between the centroid
    of each of the 7 irrigation districts under study (whose coordinates are reported
    in Table 1) and the candidate weather stations. Secondly, the selection was refined
    based on the temporal consistency (i.e. continuous time series) and completeness
    (i.e. the complete set of data) of the available agrometeorological series. Under
    these criteria, more than 50 million records were acquired from 66 weather stations,
    covering a great range of climatic conditions, mainly in terms of the different
    irrigation district geographic locations (i.e., northern, central and insular
    Italy) and elevation features (Table 1). Note that the available dataset for Sardinia
    sites was only composed of the ET0 estimates. In particular, under the improved
    Köppen-Geiger classification, recently provided at 1-km resolution by Beck et
    al. (2018), a number of 7 weather stations located in Apulia are characterized
    by arid, steppe, cold climate (BSk); 24 sites, placed in Campania, Sicily (Eastern
    and Western part) and Sardinia, are featured by dry and hot-summer temperate climate
    (Csa); and 32 sites, located in Emilia-Romagna and Lombardy, are referred to no
    dry season, hot summer temperate climate conditions (Cfa). The quality of the
    ground-based data was checked according to the procedure proposed in Allen (1996).
    Daily ground-based data was aggregated in 4 periods for seasonality analyses on
    the astronomical basis, as follows: winter (1st January–19th March and 21st-31st
    December), spring (20th March–20th June), summer (21st June– 22nd September),
    and autumn (23rd September–20th December). 2.2. Reanalysis datasets description
    The technical characteristics of the used reanalysis datasets (ERA5 single levels
    and ERA5-L) and the related data-processing steps are described in Sections 2.2.1
    and 2.2.2, respectively. 2.3. Reanalysis data collection and characteristics In
    this study, the most advanced global reanalysis data produced in Europe by ECMWF
    has been used: ERA5 single levels (Hersbach et al., 2020) and ERA5-L (Muñoz-Sabater,
    2019). The main technical details of these reanalysis datasets are reported in
    Table 2. Table 2. Main technical details of the reanalysis datasets used in this
    study. Reanalysis dataset characteristics ERA5 ERA5-L Data type Gridded Projection
    Regular latitude-longitude grid Horizontal coverage Global Horizontal resolution
    (atmosphere) 0.25° x 0.25° 0.1° x 0.1° Temporal coverage 1979 to present 1950
    to present Temporal resolution Hourly The ERA5 dataset is the 5th generation of
    ECMWF global reanalysis succeeding ERA-Interim and covering the entire globe from
    1979, at a spatial resolution of about 30 km. The ERA5-L dataset is generated
    for the entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km (released
    on a regular 0.1◦ x 0.1◦ grid) by replaying the land component of ERA5 climate
    reanalysis, from 1981 to 2–3 months before the present. Specifically, the atmospheric
    forcing in ERA5-L is provided by land fields of ERA5 atmospheric variables. In
    ERA5, Tair, air humidity and air pressure are corrected to account for the elevation
    difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher-resolution grid of ERA5-L,
    according to the so-called lapse rate correction (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019). Although
    ERA5-L runs at the enhanced spatial resolution, there is a limit that data are
    not provided for numerical grid points falling on the sea surface or in the proximity
    of the coastline (Pelosi et al., 2020). The ERA5 and ERA5-L reanalysis datasets
    were freely downloaded from the Climate Change Service Copernicus platform (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/search?type=dataset)
    through the Climate Data Store web interface v.1.0 in Network common data form
    (NetCDF) format for the entire Italian domain (1221.79 ×916.46 km), as for the
    ground-based observations, within the reference period 2008–2020. The hourly agrometeorological
    variables of interest were: the Tair (''2m_temperature'', t2m, °C) and the dew
    point temperatures (Tdew, named as ''2m_dewpoint_temperature d2m, m s-1''); the
    Rs (''surface_solar_radiation_downwards'', ssrd, J m-2) and; the vertical and
    horizontal component of the wind speed (''10m_u_component_of_wind'', U10, m s-1,
    and ''10m_v_component_of_wind'', V10, m s-1). 2.3.1. Data pre-processing steps
    Both hourly ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L data were aggregated at a daily time
    step to be compared variable-by-variable with the ground-based observations. The
    daily minimum and maximum Tair and Tdew values were obtained from the hourly data.
    The daily Tair comparisons were carried out considering the average of the daily
    maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperatures (Tmin). The daily Rs values were aggregated
    on 24 h basis. The daily RH was calculated as the ratio between the actual (ea)
    and the saturation (eo(T)) vapour pressure using the average Tair and Tdew derived
    on 24 h basis as inputs, according to the formula proposed in Allen et al. (1998):
    (1) RH = 100 ∙ e a e o ( T ) (2) e a = e o T dew = 0.6108 ∙ exp 17.27 T dew T
    dew + 237.3 (3) e o T = 0.6108 ∙ exp 17.27 T air T air + 237.3 The daily wind
    speed at 10 m (u10, m s-1) was calculated using the horizontal and vertical components
    (V10 and U10) retrieved by ERA5 and ERA5-L datasets, as reported in Allen et al.
    (1998). Note that the wind speed comparison between the ground-based and reanalysis
    observations was performed on the u10 basis. The wind speed at 2 m (u2) was rescaled,
    from the logarithmic wind profile, for being used as input in the ET0 calculation
    using the P-M approach (see Section 2.3). The above-mentioned reanalysis datasets
    data pre-processing steps were performed using five ad hoc GIS-based toolboxes
    developed in ArcPy (ESRI©) (see “Supplementary materials” section). The reanalysis
    post-processed data were extracted from the overall domain at the weather stations''
    location variable-by-variable (Fig. 1). Finally, as for the daily ground-based
    data, the reanalysis data were aggregated in four periods for seasonality analyses
    using the same time step as used for the ground-based data. 2.4. Calculating daily
    ET0 estimates Although ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L provide potential evapotranspiration
    data (ETp), this variable is conceptually different from ET0 estimates as defined
    in the FAO-56 paper (Allen et al., 1998). In particular, ETp is computed in ERA5
    based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set
    to "crops/mixed farming" and assuming "no stress from soil moisture" (Hersbach
    et al., 2018), whereas, ETp in ERA5-L is computed as open water evaporation assuming
    that the atmosphere is not affected by the artificial surface condition (Muñoz
    2019). Thus, in this study daily ET0 estimates were obtained by implementing the
    reanalysis of agrometeorological data through the Penman-Monteith (PM) method
    (Penman, 1956, Monteith, 1965), as follows: (4) ET 0 = 0.408 Δ ∙ R n − G + γ ∙
    C n T + 273 ∙ u 2 ∙ ( e s − e a ) Δ + γ ∙ ( 1 + C d u 2 ) where, Rn is the net
    radiation at the grass surface and G is the soil heat flux density (in MJ m-2
    d-1 for a 24-h daily time step); Cn and Cd are constants, equal to 900 and 0.34,
    respectively, which vary according to the time step, the reference crop type and
    daytime/night-time ratio; T is the mean daily Tair (°C); γ is the slope of the
    saturation vapour pressure curve at Tair (kPa °C-1); γ is the psychrometric constant
    (kPa °C-1); es is the saturation vapour pressure at Tair (kPa); ea is the average
    daily actual vapour pressure (kPa); and u2 is the average daily wind speed at
    2 m height (m s-1). Note that the daily ET0 ground-based estimates (mm d-1) were
    provided at all site locations by the Regional meteorological agencies (Table
    1), except for Campania and Emilia-Romagna regions for which daily ET0 values
    were estimated by Eq. 4 using the agrometeorological information measured in situ.
    2.5. Statistical indicators The comparisons between the reanalysis-based agrometeorological
    estimations, from ERA5 and ERA5-L, respectively, and the ground-based observations
    were assessed using different statistical metrics, such as the slope of the regression
    line forced by the origin; the coefficient of determination (R2); the root-mean-square
    error (RMSE; Eq. 5); the mean bias error (BIAS; Eq. 6); the mean absolute error
    (MAE; Eq. 7), and the normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE; Eq. 8); calculated
    as follows: (5) RMSE = ∑ i = 1 n S i − O i 2 n (6) MAE = 1 n ∑ S i − O i (7) PBIAS
    = ∑ ( S i − O i ) ∑ O i ⋅ 100 (8) NRMSE = RMSE O ˆ where S i is the simulated
    value by ERA5 and ERA5-L dataset, respectively, O i is the observed value from
    the ground-based agrometeorological stations, where S ˆ and O ˆ are the averages
    of the data arrays of S i and O i , and n is the number of observations. The difference
    in reproducing the agrometeorological variables by ERA5 and ERA5-L products, respectively,
    was assessed by applying the least-squares linear regression method and by comparing
    the outputs of the regression lines in terms of slope (for p-values < 0.05). This
    statistical analysis was conducted using the R software (R Core team, 2020). The
    evaluation of the topographic effect on the agrometeorological variables obtained
    by the reanalysis datasets was assessed by comparing the elevation of the selected
    weather stations (Table 1) with the average elevation observed at the cell-size
    of the ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L datasets (30 and 9 km), respectively (see
    “Supplementary materials” section). In particular, the main zonal statistics (count,
    mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and median values) of the elevation
    values were extracted at the level of the cell containing the weather stations
    (Table 1) from a digital elevation model, with a spatial resolution of 75 m, released
    by the Italian Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory
    and the Sea. 3. Results 3.1. Agrometeorological variable-by-variable comparisons

    linear regression analysis carried out to compare the daily reanalysis datasets
    (i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-L) versus the observed agrometeorological data showed significant
    differences in terms of slopes values for all the variables of interest also at
    the seasonal level. 3.1.1. Air temperature (Tair) 3.1.1.1. Tair: ERA5 versus ground-observations
    Daily average Tair values were estimated with good accuracy by the ERA5 reanalysis
    dataset at all the irrigation districts under study (Table 3), showing average
    RMSE values of 1.46 °C, 1.70 °C and 1.76 °C; and MAE values of 1.15 °C, 1.29 °C
    and 1.42 °C under Bsk, Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively. The average
    values of NRMSE varied between 0.09 and 0.14; reaching minimum and maximum values
    under Bsk and Csa-Cfa climate conditions, respectively. The PBIAS values varied
    from 0.38% (in Eastern Sicily study sites) to 6.62% (in Emilia-Romagna study sites)
    and − 9.22% (in Campania study sites); showing average values of − 2.12%, 3.12%
    and 4.14% under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively, with average
    R2 values varying between 0.94 (Csa) and 0.97 (Bsk). The slope values (b) ranged
    from 0.91 to 1.04, indicating a site-specific underestimation of 9% and overestimation
    of 4% in Campania and Emilia-Romagna study sites, respectively (Fig. 2a-f). On
    a seasonal basis, the best Tair performance was observed in autumn, showing average
    RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.61 °C, 1.27 °C, 2.64%, 1.01 and 0.89, respectively.
    Similar performances were obtained in spring-summer seasons (with average RMSE,
    MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.72 °C, 1.35 °C, −0.62%, 0.99 and 0.79, respectively),
    while a slightly lower accuracy was observed in winter (with average RMSE, MAE,
    PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.70 °C, 1.34 °C, 5.14%, 1.00 and 0.72, respectively).
    The same trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the Tair predictions
    reached the best performance in Apulia study sites during winter and summer (with
    RMSE and MAE values of 1.35 and 1.08 °C, respectively), followed by spring and
    autumn in Eastern Sicily and Lombardy study sites; whereas the lowest Tair performance
    was obtained in Campania study sites during all seasons (Table 3). 3.1.1.2. Tair:
    ERA5-L versus ground-observations Daily average Tair values were predicted with
    acceptable accuracy by the ERA-L reanalysis dataset at all the irrigation districts
    under study (Table 4), resulting in average RMSE values of 1.76 °C, 1.82 °C and
    1.97 °C; and MAE values of 1.44 °C, 1.39 °C and 1.44 °C under Csa, Cfa and Bsk
    climate conditions, respectively. The average NRMSE values varied between 0.08
    and 0.16; with similar values under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions The PBIAS
    values ranged between 1.35% (in Emilia-Romagna study sites) to − 11.75% (in Campania
    study sites); showing average values of − 4.87%, − 2.38% and 2.46% in Csa, Cfa
    and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. The average R2 values ranged from 0.93
    (Csa) to 0.95 (Cfa and Bsk); and the slope values (b) ranged from 0.89 to 0.99,
    indicating a maximum and minimum underestimation of 11% and 1% in Campania and
    Emilia-Romagna study sites, respectively (Fig. 2g-l). Seasonally greater Tair
    predictions were retrieved in summer and autumn seasons, resulting in average
    RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.73 °C, 1.36 °C, − 2.39%, 0.97 and 0.81,
    respectively; whereas, slightly lower Tair performance were observed in spring
    and winter seasons, showing average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.89 °C,
    1.48 °C, − 5.38%, 0.93 and 0.80, respectively. A similar trend was observed in
    terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the Tair predictions reached the best performance
    at Eastern Sicily study sites during spring and autumn-winter periods (with average
    RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values of 1.28 °C, 1.02 °C, −1.31%, 0.98 and 0.92,
    respectively) and in summer in Western Sicily study sites (Table 4); whereas the
    lowest Tair performance was obtained in Campania study sites during all seasons
    (Table 4). 3.1.2. Solar radiation (Rs) 3.1.2.1. Rs: ERA5 versus ground-observations
    ERA5 dataset showed good performance in estimating daily Rs under all the examined
    climate conditions (Table 3), showing average RMSE values of 32.27 W m-2, 32.43 W m-2,
    and 45.03 W m-2; MAE of 23.67 W m-2, 24.20 W m-2 and 30.72 W m-2, and NRMSE of
    0.17, 0.21 and 0.24 in Csa, Cfa and Bsk, respectively. Average PBIAS values ranged
    between 0.83% (Cfa) to 2.93% (Csa) and − 5.21% (Bsk), corresponding to R2 values
    of 0.88, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The slope terms (b) presented the same trend
    with values from 1.00 to 0.96 and 0.91 under Csa, Cfa and Bsk climate conditions,
    respectively. Seasonally, the best Rs performance was retrieved in autumn (with
    average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 27.36 W m-2, 20.34 W m-2, and 1.93%, respectively;
    and b and R2 terms of 0.88 and 0.67, respectively) at all site locations (except
    for Campania locations), followed by winter and summer. Slightly lower Rs performance
    was obtained in spring, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values
    of 43.17 W m-2, 32.09 W m-2, 2.20%, 0.96 and 0.48, respectively. In absolute terms,
    the best Rs predictions were reached in Western Sicily study sites during summer
    (also in terms of NRMSE values) and in Emilia-Romagna study sites for the other
    seasons (Table 3); whereas the lowest Rs performance was obtained in Bsk climate
    condition (Apulia study sites) during all seasons and in Campania sites for the
    autumn season in terms of NRMSE (Table 3). 3.1.2.2. Rs: ERA5-L versus ground-observations
    Daily Rs values were predicted with good accuracy by the ERA5-L reanalysis dataset
    at all study sites (Table 4), resulting in average RMSE values of 32.53 W m-2,
    34.33 W m-2 and 44.98 W m-2, and NRMSE values of 0.17, 0.21 and 0.24 under Csa,
    Cfa and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. Average MAE values ranged from 23.87 W m-2
    (Csa) to 25.06 W m-2 (Cfa) and 30.67 W m-2 (Bsk); and PBIAS values varied between
    0.96% (Cfa) to 3.09% (Csa) and − 5.29% (Bsk). The R2 values and slope terms (b)
    varied from 0.80 to 0.86 and 0.87, and from 0.91 to 0.96 and 1.00, under Bsk,
    Csa and Cfa climate conditions, respectively (Fig. 3g-l). At the seasonal level,
    the Rs predictions reached the best performance in autumn at all climate conditions
    (except for Campania locations also in terms of NRMSE), with average RMSE, MAE
    and PBIAS values of 27.96 W m-2, 20.73 W m-2, and 2.02%, respectively; and b and
    R2 terms of 0.92 and 0.65. The lower performance was observed in spring under
    all climate conditions, with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 44.23 W m-2,
    32.57 W m-2, and 2.35%, respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.98 and 0.46, respectively.
    (Table 4). Intermediate Rs performances were observed in winter and summer (Table
    4). Partially different results were observed in terms of NRMSE showing greater
    performances in summer followed by spring and winter-autumn seasons. The Rs predictions
    reached the best performance in Western Sicily during spring and summer periods
    (Table 4) and in autumn and winter seasons under Cfa climate conditions (Lombardy
    and Emilia-Romagna study sites); whereas the lowest Rs performance was obtained
    under Bsk climate condition (Apulia study sites) during all seasons also in terms
    of NRMSE values (Table 4). 3.1.3. Wind speed (u10) 3.1.3.1. u10: ERA5 versus ground-observations
    The performances of the ERA5 dataset in predicting daily u10 values are shown
    in Table 3 and Fig. 4a-f. The ERA5 accuracy shows a specific pattern as a function
    of the climate conditions, resulting in average RMSE values of 1.04 m s-1, 1.21 m s-1
    and 1.57 m s-1 under Cfa, Csa, and Bsk climate conditions, respectively. Similar
    behaviour is observed in terms of average MAE values, ranging from 0.73 m s-1
    (Cfa) to 0.91 m s-1 (Csa) and 1.17 m s-1 (Bsk). Inversely, PBIAS values were equal
    to − 19.43%, − 20.54%, and − 25.21% from Bsk to Csa and Cfa climate conditions,
    respectively. Lower R2 values were obtained at all study sites, with b terms ranging
    from 0.66 and 0.74 in Cfa-Bsk and Csa climate conditions, respectively. A similar
    trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values. ERA5 performance increased in summer-autumn/spring
    periods (with average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, NRMSE, b and R2 values of 1.16 m s-1,
    0.87 m s-1, −22.53%, 0.46, 0.70 and 0.18, respectively). Lower performance was
    observed in winter, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, NRMSE, b and R2 values
    of 1.36 m s-1, 0.97 m s-1, − 19.30%, 0.51, 0.71 and 0.22, respectively. In particular,
    relatively better performance was observed in Campania (summer) and Lombardy study
    sites (for the rest of the seasons) (Table 3), whereas, lower performance was
    registered during winter and summer in Apulia study sites, during spring for Emilia-Romagna
    and autumn for Western Sicily study sites, respectively (Table 3). 3.1.3.2. u10:
    ERA5-L versus ground-observations The accuracy and performance indicators of the
    ERA5-L dataset in predicting daily u10 values are shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4g-l.
    Similarly to ERA5, the ERA5-L accuracy shows a specific pattern as a function
    of the climate conditions, resulting in average RMSE values of 1.26 m s-1, 1.37 m s-1
    and 1.75 m s-1 in Cfa, Csa, and Bsk climate conditions, respectively; showing
    similar trends in terms of average MAE values, that ranged from 0.96 m s-1 (Cfa)
    to 1.10 m s-1 (Csa) and 1.34 m s-1 (Bsk). Conversely, PBIAS values varying between
    − 23.50% (Bsk) to − 26.40% (Csa) and − 37.17% (Cfa); with R2 and NRMSE values
    varying from 0.06 (Bsk) to 0.25 (Cfa) and 0.45 (Csa) and from 0.64 to 0.62 and
    0.52, under Bsk, Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively. The slope terms
    (b) ranged from 0.58 (Cfa) to 0.64 (Bsk) and 0.72 (Csa), indicating an underestimation
    varying from 28% to 36% and 42%, under Csa, Bsk and Cfa climate conditions, respectively.
    At the seasonal level, the u10 predictions reached the best performance in autumn,
    with average RMSE, MAE and PBIAS values of 1.34 m s-1, 1.01 m s-1, and − 20.79%,
    respectively; and b and R2 terms of 0.68 and 0.26, respectively. Lower performance
    was observed in winter, resulting in average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS, b and R2 values
    of 1.47 m s-1, 1.11 m s-1, − 23.86%, 0.70 and 0.32, respectively. Moderate u10
    performances were observed in the other seasons (Table 4). Slight differences
    were observed in terms of NRMSE values. Specifically, the u10 predictions reached
    the best and worst performance at Lombardy and Apulia study sites, respectively,
    during all seasons (Table 4). 3.1.4. Relative humidity (RH) 3.1.4.1. RH: ERA5
    versus ground-observations Good accuracy was observed in the estimation of daily
    RH values by ERA5 at all study sites (Table 3), resulting in a similar trend of
    RMSE and MAE, with values of these indicators ranging from 8.78% to 9.55% and
    19.02%, and from 6.88% to 7.47% and 15.30% under Cfa, Csa and Bsk climate conditions,
    respectively. Similar behaviour was observed in terms of NRMSE, PBIAS and b values,
    showing better performances from Cfa to Csa and Bsk climates (Fig. 5a-f). The
    slope terms and R2 values ranged from 0.81 to 1.04, and from 0.34 to 0.66, respectively.
    On a seasonal basis, the ERA5 accuracy was better in autumn and winter (average
    RMSE, MAE and NMRSE values of 10.07%, 8.06% and 0.13), followed by spring and
    summer seasons (average RMSE, MAE and NMRSE values of 11.23%, 8.96% and 0.16,
    respectively). In particular, the best ERA5 performance was retrieved at Campania
    (spring-summer), Lombardy (autumn) and Western Sicily (winter) study sites. Lower
    accuracy was obtained at Apulia study sites for all seasons. 3.1.4.2. RH: ERA5-L
    versus ground-observations The daily RH estimates predicted by ERA5-L in comparison
    to the ground-based measurements resulted in RMSE values ranging between 9.63%
    and 9.82% under Cfa and Csa climate conditions, respectively, reaching 15.98%
    in Bsk conditions (Fig. 5g-l). Similar trend was observed in terms of NRMSE values.
    This behaviour resulted in MAE and PBIAS values of 7.57%, 7.85%, 12.03% and 5.55%,
    7.66%, − 11.92% under Cfa, Csa and Bsk conditions, respectively. Similar trends
    were observed for the b and R2 terms, showing values of 1.04–1.06 and 0.86 and
    0.41–0.52 and 0.27 under Cfa-Csa and Bsk conditions, with overestimation of 4–6%
    in Cfa and Csa and underestimation of 14% at Apulia study site (Bsk). At the seasonal
    level, the overall best RH performance was observed in autumn (Table 4), with
    average RMSE, MAE, PBIAS and NRMSE values of 10.24%, 8.17%, 3.07% and 0.13, respectively.
    Similar performances were retrieved in winter and spring, with slightly lower
    ERA5-L accuracy during summer (Table 4). Specifically, the best performance was
    observed at Campania (in summer) and Lombardy study sites (in the other seasons);
    whereas lower performance at Emilia-Romagna (in winter) and Apulia study sites
    (in the other seasons) (Table 4). 3.1.5. Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) 3.1.5.1.
    ET0: ERA5 versus ground-observations Daily ET0 estimates obtained using as inputs
    the agrometeorological information provided by the ERA5 dataset showed good accuracy
    in comparison to the ground-based ET0 estimates (Table 5 and Fig. 6a-m). In particular,
    the daily ET0 estimates reached the best performance under Csa-Cfa climate conditions
    (with average RMSE, MAE and NRMSE values of 0.66 mm d-1, 0.48 mm d-1, and 0.23,
    respectively). Lower performance was observed at Bsk, resulting in average RMSE,
    MAE and NRMSE values of 0.90 mm d-1, 0.67 mm d-1, and 0.31, respectively. Positive
    average PBIAS values were obtained at Bsk (7.90%), whereas negative average PBIAS
    values of − 4.25% and − 9.64% resulted under Csa and Cfa climate conditions. Table

    20.15 0.47 0.61 0.45 12.30 0.44 At the seasonal level, the ET0 performance was
    greater during winter and autumn periods (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and
    R2 values of 0.47 mm d-1, 0.34 mm d-1, 1.98%, 0.93 and 0.58, respectively), and
    lower, but still satisfactory, in spring and summer (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS,
    b and R2 values of 0.85 mm d-1, 0.67 mm d-1, −5.58%, 0.93 and 0.59, respectively).
    Similar values were observed in terms of NRMSE values among the seasons (Table
    5). Better accuracy was obtained at Lombardy (winter-autumn seasons), Campania
    (summer) and Eastern Sicily (spring) study sites; whereas, lower accuracy was
    reached at Apulia study sites for all seasons (Table 5). 3.1.5.2. ET0: ERA5-L
    versus ground-observations Overall, ERA5-L provided daily ET0 estimates with good
    accuracy (Table 5 and Fig. 6h-n). Specifically, the daily ET0 estimates reached
    the best performance under Csa and Cfa conditions (with average RMSE, MAE and
    NRMSE values of 0.63 mm d-1, 0.46 mm d-1 and 0.22, respectively) (Table 5 and
    Fig. 6h-n). The lower performance was observed at Bsk, with average RMSE, MAE
    and NRMSE values of 0.88 mm d-1, 0.64 mm d-1 and 0.30, respectively. Positive
    average PBIAS values were obtained under Bsk (5.86%); whereas under Csa and Cfa
    climate conditions resulted in values ranging from − 2.53% to − 10.81%, respectively.
    At the seasonal level, the ET0 performance resulted better in winter and autumn
    (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and R2 values of 0.50 mm d-1, 0.36 mm d-1, −3.84%,
    0.90 and 0.64, respectively), and lower, but still quite satisfactory, in spring
    and summer (with average RMSE, MAE, BIAS, b and R2 values of 0.77 mm d-1, 0.60 mm
    d-1, −3.53%, 0.94 and 0.63, respectively). As for the ERA5, similar values were
    observed in terms of NRMSE values among the seasons (Table 5). Greater accuracy
    was obtained at Lombardy (winter-autumn seasons) and Western Sicily (spring-summer
    seasons) study sites, while lower accuracy was obtained at Apulia study sites
    for all seasons (Table 5). 4. Discussion Climate reanalysis data have been widely
    used for hydrological and meteorological applications. However, it is still difficult
    to quantitatively estimate their accuracy due to their variability both at spatial
    and temporal scales, especially under complex topography and pronounced climatic
    heterogeneity (i.e., the rainfall) (Jiao et al., 2021). Often, ground variables
    are taken into account in the reanalysis process (such as air pressure, Tair,
    RH and u10) to improve the reanalysis data quality. However, if the data assimilation
    approach can improve data accuracy, by adding physically meaningful information
    from the predictive model, this is still subject to uncertainty. The main sources
    of uncertainty are due to numerical simulations, assimilation schemes and errors
    associated with the observation systems (Dee et al., 2011). In this sense, some
    studies showed that it is difficult to completely replace observational data with
    reanalysis information for describing the true state of the atmosphere (Bengtsson
    et al., 2004), e.g., for long-term climate trend studies (Liu et al., 2018) and/or
    for capturing seasonal and inter-annual changes (Jiao et al., 2021). This study
    explored the potential of using the new released ECMWF climate reanalysis datasets
    (i.e., ERA5 and ERA5-L) for proving daily and seasonal agrometeorological information
    (Tair, Rs, RH, u10 and ET0) by determining their performance against measured
    ground-based observations within the Italian territory in the reference period
    2008 – 2020. Moreover, since new user requirements are constantly emerging in
    society (Muñoz-Sabater et al., 2021), ad hoc user-interfaces GIS-based user-friendly
    tools have been developed in this study for supporting the needs of a diverse
    set of users, next to the climate and weather research motivations, within the
    reanalysis data pre-processing steps (Fig. 1.S-4. S). Herein, a generally good
    agreement was observed between the ability of ERA5 and ERA5-L products in reproducing
    the agrometeorological variables of interest (commonly used for ET calculation)
    in comparison to the ground-based observations collected at 66 study sites distributed
    over 7 irrigation districts. Specifically, the daily Tair estimates offered the
    most accurate reanalysis predictions, followed by the RH, Rs, and u10 variables,
    which still provided satisfactory results (Table 3, Table 4, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig.
    5). Similar (i.e., for RH) or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained
    by ERA5 in comparison to ERA5-L (i.e., showing lower RMSE values than ERA5-L,
    for Tair and Rs, respectively, in 67% and 83% of the total number of the investigated
    irrigation districts). This can be attributed to the fact these variables are
    more homogeneous at the spatial scales provided by ERA5 products in comparison
    to ERA5-L (Fig. 5. S in Supplementary materials section). The u10 performance
    was always more consistent for ERA5 than ERA5-L in comparison to the observations
    at all irrigation districts, most likely because ERA5-L does not consider the
    influence of the sea surface in its products (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019). Altogether,
    the daily Tair, Rs, RH, and u10 estimates were more accurate during the autumn
    season for both reanalysis datasets (Table 3, Table 4). The influence of topographic
    features on the accuracy of the reanalysis data was also investigated, following
    the evidence that it could be significant provided by previous studies. For example,
    Gao and Hao (2014) evaluated the relationship existing between the elevation of
    the climate reanalysis data from ERA-Interim and the observed station’s elevation.
    These authors pointed out that differences in elevation can affect the accuracy
    of the reanalysis data, especially in areas with relatively higher altitudes.
    Analogous considerations are reported by Longo-Minnolo et al. (2022) for a Sicilian
    watershed, with elevation values ranging between 0 and 3313 m a.s.l., for which
    the highest RMSE values were observed in the ERA5-L cells with relatively higher
    variations in altitude. To overcome these shortcomings in mountainous areas, other
    authors suggest applying altitude correction procedures, especially for water
    vapour, precipitation and Tair estimates (Zhao et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2012;
    Hu et al., 2013; Negm et al., 2018). For altitudes below 1000 m (a.s.l.), however,
    Jiao et al. (2021) found a good agreement between climate reanalysis and observational
    data. Similar results emerged from this study, where no specific relationships
    were obtained between the elevation changes and the goodness of reanalysis datasets
    in reproducing the agrometeorological variables of interest, at the site-by-site
    scale, within the seven irrigation districts under investigation (Table 1). These
    findings show that the accuracy of the reanalyses products is strongly connected
    with the climatic conditions rather than the topographic distribution of the selected
    study sites. Due to the above-mentioned explanations and for maintaining the integrity
    of the reanalysis datasets, no topography corrections were applied in this study.
    The performance of reanalysis data strongly depends on the different climate conditions
    characterizing the investigated sites, as shown by Tarek et al. (2020). Specifically,
    these authors observed that Tair and precipitation estimated by ERA5 are systematically
    more performant in comparison to ERA-Interim at all the 13 Northern America climate
    zones under study. In addition, they reported that in situ measurements are higher
    than ERA5 for Cfa and hot-summer humid continental (Dfa) climate zones; elsewhere,
    these differences are less pronounced. In this sense, they did not experience
    the difference in hydrological modelling performance using both ERA5 products
    and observations over 9 of the 13 climate zones. For the remaining regions (Bsk,
    Cfa, Dfa, and warm-summer humid continental climate, Dfb), the use of observations
    resulted in improved hydrological modelling performance. In agreement with Tarek
    et al. (2020), in our study site-specific performance depended on the different
    investigated climate conditions (Table 1). In particular, the major part of the
    variables of interest (Rs, RH, u10 and ET0) resulted in greater and lower performance
    under Csa and Bks climate conditions, respectively, by both reanalysis datasets,
    except for Tair estimates provided by ERA5 that shows an inverted pattern due
    to the influence of the sea temperature in this product (Hersbach et al., 2020).
    Intermediate performance was observed under Cfa climate zones. The good quality
    of the reanalysis data was translated into reliable daily and seasonal ET0 estimates
    (with an underestimation from 2 up to 13% for the climate classes under study).
    Specifically, as for the other variables, ET0 estimates were more accurate in
    autumn/winter than in spring/summer by both reanalysis datasets in terms of RMSE
    values (Table 5 and Fig. 6). In addition, ERA5-L reproduces with greater accuracy
    and higher spatial resolution the ET0 observations at most of the study sites
    even under different climate conditions, i.e., showing lower RMSE values than
    ERA5 in 86% of the total number of the irrigation districts under study. Thus,
    the high accuracy obtained in this study when estimating ET0 by reanalysis products
    (resulting in RMSE and NRMSE values ranging between 0.57 and 0.90 mm d-1 and from
    0.17 to 0.31, respectively) suggests the potential use of this information for
    calculating the daily crop evapotranspiration rates aiming at supporting the irrigation
    scheduling. In this sense, Rolle et al. (2021) have recently estimated the global
    irrigation requirement of 26 crops by implementing the Hargreaves-Samani method
    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to calculate ET0, by using information on Tair and
    Rs retrieved by the ERA5 dataset. Other studies assessed the use of a blended
    set of weather input data composed of ERA5-L outputs and different sources of
    climate data (i.e., reanalysis data and satellite-based radiation data) to evaluate
    the ET0 for the Campania region (Pelosi et al., 2020, Pelosi and Chirico, 2021).
    Pelosi et al. (2021) combined the ERA5-L products with multispectral satellite
    imagery for estimating the past crop evapotranspiration. Under this scenario,
    the results of the present study may contribute to the informed use of reanalysis
    data in water management applications in Italy and elsewhere. 5. Conclusion This
    study explores the performance of the ERA5 single levels and ERA5-L in depicting
    the agrometeorological data from 2008 to 2020 in comparison to observational data
    measured at 66 sites distributed over 7 irrigation districts over the Italian
    territory. Specifically, the main findings that can be drawn from this study are
    the following: – the daily average Tair estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis
    predictions, followed by RH, Rs, and u10 variables. This was translated into reliable
    daily ET0 estimates resulting in RMSE and NRMSE values ranging between 0.57 and
    0.90 mm d-1 and from 0.17 to 0.31, respectively; – similar or slightly improved
    statistical metrics were obtained by ERA5 in comparison to ERA5-L in estimating
    RH, Tair and Rs; whereas the u10 and ET0 performances were more consistent by
    ERA5 and ERA5-L, respectively, when compared to the observations at the majority
    of the irrigation districts under study; – the Rs, RH, u10 and ET0 estimates resulted
    in higher and lower performance under Csa and Bks climate conditions, respectively,
    by both reanalysis datasets; conversely, a reverse pattern was obtained for Tair
    estimates provided by ERA5, being more accurate under Bsk. Intermediate performance
    was observed under Cfa climate zones. These results help to improve our understanding
    of the uncertain sources of reanalysis data under different climate conditions,
    the rational application of these datasets and the potential improvements for
    the next product generation. In addition, they open promising perspectives for
    the use of reanalysis data as an alternative data source to estimate ET0 for irrigation
    water management in different climate contexts, overcoming the limited availability
    of observed agrometeorological data in many areas. CRediT authorship contribution

    to represent its erratic spatial distribution; a study over Central Italy (period:
    1951-2019), has shown that ERA5 generally overestimates the annual rainfall, except
    on the north-central Apennines where it is underestimated [10]. Anyway, with reference
    to several Italian irrigation districts, a general good agreement was obtained
    between observed and reanalysis (ERA5 and ERA5 Land) derived agrometeorological
    variables at both daily and seasonal scales [9]. For these reasons, the dataset

    \ biomass (AGB) serves as an indicator of crop growth status, and acquiring\n\
    timely AGB information is crucial for estimating crop yield and determining appropriate\
    \ water and\nfertilizer inputs. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with\
    \ RGB cameras offer an affordable\nand practical solution for efﬁciently obtaining\
    \ crop AGB. However, traditional vegetation indices\n(VIs) alone are insufﬁcient\
    \ in capturing crop canopy structure, leading to poor estimation accuracy.\nMoreover,\
    \ different ﬂight heights and machine learning algorithms can impact estimation\
    \ accu-\nracy. Therefore, this study aims to enhance wheat AGB estimation accuracy\
    \ by combining VIs, crop\nheight, and texture features while investigating the\
    \ inﬂuence of ﬂight height and machine learning\nalgorithms on estimation. During\
    \ the heading and grain-ﬁlling stages of wheat, wheat AGB data\nand UAV RGB images\
    \ were collected at ﬂight heights of 30 m, 60 m, and 90 m. Machine learning\n\
    algorithms, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Gradient Boosting Regression\
    \ Trees (GBRT),\nRidge Regression (RR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection\
    \ Operator (Lasso) and Support Vector\nRegression (SVR), were utilized to construct\
    \ wheat AGB estimation models. The research ﬁndings\nare as follows: (1) Estimation\
    \ accuracy using VIs alone is relatively low, with R2 values ranging from\n0.519\
    \ to 0.695. However, combining VIs with crop height and texture features improves\
    \ estima-\ntion accuracy, with R2 values reaching 0.845 to 0.852. (2) Estimation\
    \ accuracy gradually decreases\nwith increasing ﬂight height, resulting in R2\
    \ values of 0.519–0.852, 0.438–0.837, and 0.445–0.827\nfor ﬂight heights of 30\
    \ m, 60 m, and 90 m, respectively. (3) The choice of machine learning algo-\n\
    rithm signiﬁcantly inﬂuences estimation accuracy, with RFR outperforming other\
    \ machine learnings.\nIn conclusion, UAV RGB images contain valuable crop canopy\
    \ information, and effectively uti-\nlizing this information in conjunction with\
    \ machine learning algorithms enables accurate wheat\nAGB estimation, providing\
    \ a new approach for precision agriculture management using UAV remote\nsensing\
    \ technology.\nKeywords: above-ground biomass; unmanned aerial vehicle; ﬂight\

    \ which is closely inﬂuenced by factors such as photosynthesis, nu-\ntrient absorption,\
    \ and climate [1]. Measuring crop AGB plays a crucial role in assessing\ncrop\
    \ growth status, determining fertilization requirements, promptly detecting pests\
    \ and\ndiseases, and predicting crop yield [2]. However, traditional manual sampling\
    \ methods for\nmeasuring crop AGB are reliable but expensive, destructive, and\
    \ limited in terms of the\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3653. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15143653\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3653\n2 of\
    \ 18\nnumber of sampling points. Consequently, they are only suitable for small-scale\
    \ agricul-\ntural areas and fail to meet the demand for quantitative monitoring\
    \ of crop AGB over larger\nregions [3]. Hence, there is a need to explore more\
    \ efﬁcient, cost-effective, and dependable\nmethods for acquiring timely crop\
    \ AGB information.\nRemote sensing technology enables the collection of crop canopy\
    \ reﬂectance infor-\nmation from a distance, without direct contact. Analyzing\
    \ and processing this reﬂectance\ninformation allows for non-destructive monitoring\
    \ of crop growth [4]. In comparison to\nground surveys, remote sensing technology\
    \ offers real-time, non-destructive, and large-\nscale estimation of crop AGB\
    \ [5]. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remote sensing\ntechnology has proven effective\
    \ in crop growth monitoring due to its affordability, ease\nof use, and high temporal\
    \ and spatial resolution [6]. The primary sensors used in UAVs\ninclude RGB digital\
    \ cameras, multispectral sensors, hyperspectral sensors, and LiDAR\nsensors [7,8].\
    \ Although multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR sensors provide superior\n\
    accuracy and versatility, their high cost and complexity limit their widespread\
    \ applica-\ntion [9]. In contrast, RGB digital cameras are preferred for crop\
    \ growth monitoring due\nto their cost-effectiveness, lightweight nature, high\
    \ spatial resolution, and simpliﬁed data\nprocessing [10,11].\nNumerous studies\
    \ have demonstrated the effectiveness of estimating the AGB of wheat,\nmaize,\
    \ and rice by calculating vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV RGB images [12–14].\
    \ How-\never, VIs alone are limited in capturing internal information of vertically\
    \ growing crop\norgans, leading to lower accuracy in estimation [15]. To address\
    \ this limitation, some\nstudies have explored the combination of VIs with crop\
    \ height (CH) [16]. CH provides in-\nsights into the vertical structure of crops\
    \ and its variations reﬂect the health and nutritional\nstatus of crops, thereby\
    \ aiding in AGB estimation [17]. UAV RGB images can be stitched\ntogether to generate\
    \ a digital surface model (DSM), which, in turn, enables the derivation\nof crop\
    \ height models for obtaining CH information [18]. Crop height models based on\n\
    UAV remote sensing technology can provide accurate CH. When combined with VIs,\
    \ they\nprovide a novel approach for in-ﬁeld estimation of crop AGB.\nWhile VIs\
    \ are commonly used indicators for estimating crop AGB, their accuracy\ncan be\
    \ inﬂuenced by various factors such as soil background, lighting conditions, and\n\
    weather [19]. Moreover, VIs tend to lose sensitivity during the reproductive growth\
    \ stage,\nlimiting their effectiveness as standalone estimators of crop AGB. On\
    \ the other hand, texture\nfeatures are less susceptible to these factors and\
    \ can provide valuable high-frequency\ninformation about crop growth status, including\
    \ leaf morphology, distribution density,\nand leaf arrangement [20]. Texture features\
    \ refer to the variations in grayscale distribution\nof pixels within their neighboring\
    \ area, enabling them to reﬂect the spatial distribution\nof vegetation in the\
    \ image and its relationship with the surrounding environment [21].\nTherefore,\
    \ combining VIs with texture features shows great potential in enhancing the\n\
    accuracy of crop AGB estimation.\nIn UAV remote sensing, flight height is a crucial\
    \ factor that influences image resolution and\nquality [22]. Currently, in studies\
    \ aimed at estimating crop growth parameters, flight heights typi-\ncally range\
    \ from 30 to 100 m, corresponding to image resolutions of 1 to 10 cm [5,23]. However,\n\
    the selection of ﬂight heights and corresponding image resolutions in current\
    \ research is\nsubjective and arbitrary, lacking uniﬁed standards and guidelines.\
    \ This lack of standard-\nization poses challenges for the application and dissemination\
    \ of crop growth parameter\ninversion models based on UAV remote sensing technology.\
    \ Therefore, evaluating the im-\npact of different ﬂight height images on crop\
    \ AGB estimation holds signiﬁcant importance\nin formulating standardized guidelines\
    \ for UAV image acquisition.\nThe continuous progress in artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and computer science has propelled\nthe development of machine learning algorithms,\
    \ leading to their widespread application\nin agricultural remote sensing data\
    \ analysis [24]. As a branch of machine learning, deep\nlearning has experienced\
    \ rapid growth. For instance, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) and\nconvolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNN) are two renowned deep learning algorithms that\npossess\
    \ unique advantages and have been successfully applied in various ﬁelds. ANN\n\
    Remote Sens. 2023, 15, 3653\n3 of 18\nexcels in capturing complex nonlinear relationships\
    \ within data and can generalize well to\nunseen samples with appropriate training\
    \ [25]. It is effective in handling high-dimensional\ndatasets, making it suitable\
    \ for tasks such as image recognition and natural language\nprocessing. On the\
    \ other hand, CNN is speciﬁcally designed for image processing tasks and\nis highly\
    \ efﬁcient in extracting spatial features from images [26]. It utilizes convolutional\n\
    layers to automatically detect patterns and structures, exhibiting remarkable\
    \ performance\nin object detection and image classiﬁcation tasks. However, it\
    \ is important to note that while\nANN and CNN demonstrate promise in many applications,\
    \ they also have limitations.\nCompared to traditional machine learning algorithms,\
    \ deep learning algorithms typically\nrequire a large amount of labeled training\
    \ data and longer training times. Additionally, the\ncomplex network architecture\
    \ and hyperparameter tuning in deep learning models can\npose challenges in terms\
    \ of interpretability and computational resources [7]. Traditional\nmachine learning\
    \ algorithms, on the other hand, have certain advantages in interpretability,\n\
    training speed, handling small-sample data, data requirements, and parameter optimiza-\n\
    tion. Currently, traditional machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest\
    \ Regression\n(RFR), Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), and Support Vector\
    \ Regression (SVR)\nare widely used for estimating various crop growth parameters,\
    \ including monitoring\ncorn leaf area index, estimating soybean yield, and assessing\
    \ wheat nitrogen nutrition\nstatus [7,27,28]. It is worth noting that each machine\
    \ learning algorithm operates based on\nits unique principles; therefore, when\
    \ applied to the same dataset, they may yield different\nresults. By understanding\
    \ their distinct working principles, researchers can signiﬁcantly\nimprove the\
    \ accuracy and reliability of crop growth parameter estimation. In addition to\n\
    selecting suitable machine learning algorithms, feature importance analysis and\
    \ hyper-\nparameter tuning are of signiﬁcant importance in the ﬁeld of machine\
    \ learning. Feature\nimportance analysis helps us understand the essence of the\
    \ data and enhance the model’s\ninterpretability by determining the contribution\
    \ of input features to the model’s prediction\nresults [29]. On the other hand,\
    \ reasonable selection of hyperparameters can enhance the\naccuracy and stability\
    \ of the model, avoiding overﬁtting or underﬁtting and optimizing\nthe utilization\
    \ of computational resources [18]. Both of these processes are critical steps\n\
    in optimizing the performance and interpretability of machine learning models,\
    \ playing\ncrucial roles in improving model performance and facilitating the practical\
    \ application of\nmachine learning.\nIn summary, previous studies on wheat AGB\
    \ estimation have solely relied on simple\nindicators such as VIs, making it difﬁcult\
    \ to accurately capture crop canopy structure and\nresulting in low estimation\
    \ accuracy. Additionally, different ﬂight altitudes and machine\nlearning algorithms\
    \ can also inﬂuence the estimation results. To address these issues,\nthis study\
    \ adopted the following approaches. Firstly, a comprehensive feature-based\nestimation\
    \ method was proposed, integrating traditional VIs with CH and texture features\n\
    to more accurately reﬂect wheat AGB. Secondly, the study explored the impact of\
    \ different\nﬂight altitudes and multiple machine learning algorithms on estimation\
    \ accuracy, thereby\nbroadening the choice of UAV ﬂight altitudes and methods\
    \ for wheat AGB estimation.\nTherefore, the study puts forward the following hypotheses:\
    \ (1) integrating VIs, CH, and\ntexture features can more accurately reﬂect the\
    \ growth status of wheat, hypothesizing\nthat combining multiple features can\
    \ improve estimation accuracy; (2) different ﬂight\naltitudes may lead to variations\
    \ in observing wheat canopy structure, hypothesizing\nthat estimation accuracy\
    \ decreases with increasing ﬂight altitude; (3) different machine\nlearning algorithms\
    \ have different implementation principles, hypothesizing that the\nchoice of\
    \ different machine learning algorithms signiﬁcantly affects wheat yield estimation\n\
    accuracy. By validating these innovative methods and hypotheses, this study aims\
    \ to\nprovide new approaches and insights for accurately estimating wheat AGB\
    \ and to offer new\navenues for precision agricultural management based on unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle remote\nsensing technology.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3653\n4 of\

    The RGB images of the bare soil period before wheat emergence, the heading stage,\n\
    and the grain ﬁlling stage of wheat were used to create Digital Surface Models\
    \ (DSMs)\nusing Pix4D software. Next, the raster calculation tool in ArcMap software\
    \ was employed\nto determine the difference between the DSMs at the heading and\
    \ grain ﬁlling stages of\nwheat and the DSM at the bare soil period [18]. This\
    \ calculation enabled the derivation\nof the corresponding CH at the heading stage,\
    \ and the grain ﬁlling stage. Subsequently,\nthe average CH for each plot was\
    \ obtained using the mean method. This approach, based\non DSMs, facilitated the\
    \ acquisition of CH information, which formed a robust basis for\nsubsequent wheat\
    \ AGB estimation.\n2.4.3. Texture Feature Extraction\nIn this study, the ENVI\
    \ software version 5.3 (Harris Geospatial Solutions, Inc., Boulder,\nCO, USA)\
    \ utilized used to compute gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the\nGLCM\
    \ was utilized to extract texture features from the R, G, and B bands of the original\n\
    images [27]. A total of seven texture features, including variance (Var), homogeneity\
    \ (Hom),\ncontrast (Con), dissimilarity (Dis), entropy (Ent), second moment (Sec),\
    \ and correlation\n(Cor), were extracted [28]. Consequently, a total of 21 texture\
    \ features were obtained\nfrom the R, G, and B channels for each growth stage.\
    \ These extracted texture features\nprovide valuable insights into the crop canopy\
    \ information within the images and serve as\na foundational component for subsequent\
    \ wheat AGB estimation.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3653\n7 of 18\n2.5. Machine Learning\
    \ Algorithms\n2.5.1. SVR\nThe objective of SVR is to construct a regression model\
    \ that ﬁts the data distribution\nby ﬁnding the solution to an optimization problem\
    \ [18,28]. In SVR, data are mapped to\na high-dimensional feature space, and an\
    \ optimal hyperplane is found in that space to\naccommodate the target values\
    \ to the maximum extent and minimize the gap between\npredicted and actual values.\
    \ The parameters that need to be adjusted in SVR include the\nkernel function,\
    \ which can be a linear, polynomial (poly), or radial basis function (rbf).\n\
    The choice of an appropriate kernel function depends on the data’s characteristics\
    \ and\nthe nature of non-linear relationships. The C parameter is the regularization\
    \ parameter\nthat controls the model’s complexity and tolerance. Smaller C values\
    \ result in a smoother\nmodel, while larger C values allow more training errors.\
    \ In this study, the adjustment range\nfor C is from 0.1 to 1, with a step size\
    \ of 0.01. The gamma parameter is the width parameter\nfor the rbf kernel. A smaller\
    \ gamma value represents a broader basis function, while a\nlarger gamma value\
    \ makes the basis function narrower. In this study, the adjustment range\nfor\
    \ gamma is from 0.1 to 1, with a step size of 0.01. All machine learning algorithms\
    \ in this\nstudy use grid search to try out different combinations of parameters\
    \ and select the best\nperforming ones.\n2.5.2. Ridge Regression\nRidge Regression\
    \ (RR) is a classical linear regression method used for handling re-\ngression\
    \ data with collinearity [18]. It controls the complexity of the model by introducing\n\
    an L2 regularization term, thereby reducing the risk of overﬁtting. The objective\
    \ of Ridge\nRegression is to minimize the loss function, which is composed of\
    \ the sum of squared\nresiduals and the regularization term. The regularization\
    \ term is the product of the sum of\nsquared coefﬁcients and a tuning parameter,\
    \ alpha. When performing Ridge Regression,\nthe parameter that needs to be adjusted\
    \ is alpha. A smaller alpha value indicates weaker\nregularization, which may\
    \ result in overﬁtting. On the other hand, a larger alpha value\nincreases the\
    \ strength of regularization, which may lead to underﬁtting. In this study, the\n\
    range for adjusting alpha is from 0 to 0.03, with a step size of 0.001.\n2.5.3.\
    \ Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\nLeast Absolute Shrinkage and\
    \ Selection Operator (Lasso) is a linear regression method\nused for handling\
    \ regression data with collinearity (i.e., high correlation among fea-\ntures)\
    \ [33]. Compared to traditional linear regression methods, Lasso regression introduces\n\
    an L1 regularization term that sets some feature coefﬁcients to zero, effectively\
    \ reducing the\ncomplexity of the model and the inﬂuence of features. When performing\
    \ Lasso regression,\nthe parameter that needs to be adjusted is alpha. In this\
    \ study, the range for adjusting the\nalpha parameter in Lasso regression is from\
    \ 0 to 0.03, with a step size of 0.001.\n2.5.4. RFR\nRFR is an ensemble learning\
    \ algorithm that utilizes the predictions of multiple decision\ntrees to make\
    \ accurate estimations. It constructs each decision tree by randomly selecting\n\
    a subset of features and samples from the dataset. The ﬁnal prediction is obtained\
    \ by\naveraging the predictions of these individual trees [5,34]. RFR offers several\
    \ advantages,\nsuch as its ability to handle high-dimensional feature spaces,\
    \ robustness, and reduction\nof overﬁtting risks [18]. Consequently, it is well-suited\
    \ for various regression problems.\nThe parameters that need to be adjusted in\
    \ Random Forest Regression (RFR) include the\nnumber of decision trees (n_estimators)\
    \ and the maximum depth of the trees (max_depth).\nThe number of decision trees\
    \ is crucial in RFR. Too few trees may result in underﬁtting,\nwhere the model\
    \ lacks the ability to capture complex relationships in the data; on the other\n\
    hand, having too many trees may lead to overﬁtting, where the model becomes overly\n\
    complex and excessively ﬁts the training data, resulting in poor generalization\
    \ to new\nsamples. In this study, the range for adjusting the number of decision\
    \ trees is set from\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 3653\n8 of 18\n50 to 1000, with a\
    \ step size of 10. The maximum depth of the trees is another important\nparameter.\
    \ A small tree depth limits the complexity of the model, potentially causing\n\
    underﬁtting and the inadequate ﬁtting of complex relationships in the data. Conversely,\
    \ a\nlarge tree depth may lead to overﬁtting, where the decision trees become\
    \ overly complex\nand overﬁt the training data, resulting in poor generalization.\
    \ In this study, the range for\nadjusting the tree depth is set from 3 to 30,\
    \ with a step size of 1.\n2.5.5. GBRT\nGBRT is a robust machine learning algorithm\
    \ that combines decision trees with gra-\ndient boosting techniques, making it\
    \ capable of handling nonlinear relationships, high-\ndimensional features, and\
    \ complex datasets effectively. The fundamental concept behind\nGBRT is to train\
    \ a sequence of decision tree models iteratively, where each model is trained\n\
    based on the residuals of the previous model. During each iteration, GBRT optimizes\n\
    the loss function using gradient descent, gradually minimizing the difference\
    \ between\npredicted values and actual values to enhance the model’s accuracy\
    \ [35]. The parameters\nthat need to be adjusted for GBRT include the number of\
    \ decision trees, the tree depth, and\nthe learning rate. The adjustment range\
    \ for the number of decision trees and tree depth\nis the same as for RFR. The\
    \ learning rate is an important parameter for tuning the GBRT\nmodel. A smaller\
    \ learning rate requires more decision trees to build the model, resulting in\n\
    a better ﬁt to the training data, but it may require longer training time. A larger\
    \ learning\nrate can speed up the training process but may lead to overﬁtting,\
    \ making the model overly\nsensitive to the training data and reducing its generalization\
    \ ability. In this study, the\nlearning rate for GBRT ranges from 0.01 to 0.1,\
    \ with a step size of 0.01.\n2.6. Accuracy Evaluation\nIn this study, a 5-fold\
    \ cross-validation method was employed to evaluate the perfor-\nmance of machine\
    \ learning algorithms, aiming to mitigate errors caused by random dataset\nsplits\
    \ [36]. The basic idea of this method is to randomly divide the dataset into 5\
    \ different\nsubsets, with each subset taking turns as the test set while the\
    \ remaining parts serve as\nthe training set. This process is repeated 5 times\
    \ to ensure that each subset is used as both\ntraining and test data. Finally,\
    \ the average of the evaluation metrics obtained from the\n5 test sets is used\
    \ as an indicator to assess the model’s performance. The determination\ncoefﬁcient\
    \ (R2) and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) were utilized as evaluation\n\
    metrics in this study, and their calculation formulae are as follows [37]:\nR2\
    \ = 1 − ∑n\ni=1 (xi − yi)2\n∑n\ni=1 (xi − y)2\n(1)\nrRMSE =\nq\n∑n\ni=1 (xi−yi)2\n\
    n\ny\n× 100%,\n(2)\nwhere xi is the measured AGB, yi is the estimated AGB, y is\
    \ the mean of the measured AGB,\nand n is the number of samples in the test set.\n\
    Figure 3 illustrates the main workﬂow of this study, depicting the process from\
    \ data\nacquisition to model construction and validation. First, various features\
    \ are extracted from\nUAV RGB images at different heights (30 m, 60 m, and 90\
    \ m), including VIs, CH, and\ntexture features. Concurrently, in-ﬁeld wheat AGB\
    \ data are collected as the target variable\nfor the models. Subsequently, using\
    \ these extracted features as inputs, machine learning\nalgorithms such as RFR,\

    \ ﬁnding is consistent with the results reported\nby Mao et al. [39], which also\
    \ highlight the importance of combining multiple features\nto enhance crop AGB\
    \ estimation accuracy. This is because different features can reﬂect\ncrop information\
    \ from different aspects, and the combination of multiple features can\ncomplement\
    \ each other and effectively improve the accuracy of crop AGB estimation [25].\n\
    For example, VIs can quantitatively describe crop growth based on the reﬂectance\
    \ of\nvegetation, but they are unable to capture detailed information about vegetation\
    \ structure\nand composition [40]. In contrast, texture features can provide detailed\
    \ information on\nvegetation characteristics, such as shape, size, and orientation,\
    \ representing the high-\nfrequency information of the crop [41]. Additionally,\
    \ CH information can offer insights\ninto the vertical structural information\
    \ of vegetation, better reﬂecting the plant’s growth\nstatus [16]. Therefore,\
    \ the combination of VIs, CH, and texture features allows for the\nutilization\
    \ of different types of features, leading to improved estimation accuracy [18].\n\
    Additionally, this study analyzed the importance of each feature in estimating\
    \ the\nAGB of wheat. Among the VIs, EXG obtained the highest importance score,\
    \ reaching\n14.47%. This could be attributed to EXG’s ability to effectively capture\
    \ the differences\nbetween the green and red components in wheat images, providing\
    \ crucial information\nabout vegetation growth conditions [30]. Among the texture\
    \ features, Cor exhibited higher\nimportance scores compared to other features,\
    \ all exceeding 5%. This may be because\nCor is used to describe the degree of\
    \ correlation between pixels in an image, representing\npixel value similarity\
    \ [21]. In wheat images, highly correlated pixels may indicate regions\nwith similar\
    \ colors and textures, which are related to the morphology and structure of\n\
    wheat plants. For CH, it serves as an important indicator for assessing factors\
    \ such as plant\ngrowth status and biomass accumulation [16]. Therefore, CH still\
    \ maintains a substantial\nimportance score of 12.12% in AGB estimation. In conclusion,\
    \ all types of features have\nrelatively high importance scores. This suggests\
    \ that VIs, texture features, and crop height\nplay important roles in estimating\
    \ AGB in wheat.\n4.2. Inﬂuence of Flight Height on Estimation Accuracy\nIn UAV\
    \ remote sensing applications, ﬂight height is a crucial parameter that affects\n\
    several aspects, including spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and data\
    \ acquisition\ncost [22]. The choice of ﬂight height also has an impact on the\
    \ estimation results for\nwheat AGB. This study suggests that a ﬂight height of\
    \ 30 m outperforms 60 m and 90 m,\nand this superiority can be attributed to several\
    \ factors. Firstly, as shown in Figure 10,\na ﬂight height of 30 m provides a\
    \ higher spatial resolution (0.81 cm/pixel) compared to\n60 m (1.61 cm/pixel)\
    \ and 90 m (2.42 cm/pixel). This higher resolution allows for more\ndetailed information\
    \ and greater accuracy in capturing the growth status and structural\ncharacteristics\
    \ of wheat [4]. In contrast, higher ﬂight heights result in decreased spatial\n\
    resolution, making it challenging to detect subtle variations in AGB and reducing\
    \ the\naccuracy of estimation. Secondly, the choice of ﬂight height also affects\
    \ the signal-to-\nnoise ratio of the images. At lower ﬂight heights, the camera\
    \ captures clearer images,\nminimizing the impact of noise. Additionally, ﬂying\
    \ at a lower height reduces the distance\nbetween the ground and the sensor, mitigating\
    \ the inﬂuence of atmospheric disturbances\nand enhancing the overall image quality\
    \ [42]. This study focuses on the common ﬂight\naltitudes of 30 m, 60 m, and 90\
    \ m to cover the range commonly used in practical UAV\noperations. Based on the\
    \ results of this study, we have reason to believe that lower ﬂight\naltitudes\
    \ will result in higher estimation accuracy. However, it is important to consider\
    \ the\npractical aspect of acquiring UAV remote sensing data, which involves cost\
    \ considerations.\nTable 6 presents various costs required to complete the ﬂight\
    \ missions in this study. It\nis evident that a ﬂight height of 30 m requires\
    \ more ﬂight time, waypoints, ﬂight path\nlength, and photo storage, thereby increasing\
    \ the data acquisition cost. The selection of\nthe optimal ﬂight altitude should\
    \ take into account data requirements, cost-effectiveness,\nfeasibility, and mission\
    \ objectives to ensure satisfactory results. For example, in crop\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2023, 15, 3653\n14 of 18\nbreeding research, lower ﬂight altitudes (e.g., 10–30\
    \ m) can provide higher image resolution\nand stronger capabilities in capturing\
    \ crop details and spatial structures. This is crucial for\nbreeders as they can\
    \ analyze crop phenotypic features, genetic traits, and growth dynamics\nmore\
    \ accurately, thereby evaluating crop performance and selecting suitable varieties.\
    \ In\nthis case, higher estimation accuracy is necessary as even small differences\
    \ can have a\nsigniﬁcant impact on crop breeding. However, for large-scale crop\
    \ monitoring on farms,\nhigher ﬂight altitudes (e.g., 90 m or higher) may be more\
    \ suitable. Although such altitudes\nmay result in decreased image resolution,\
    \ the impact of differences may be acceptable\nfor crop monitoring across the\
    \ entire farm. In this scenario, even with slightly reduced\nestimation accuracy,\
    \ it is still possible to assess crop health, fertilization, irrigation needs,\n\
    and take timely management measures. Therefore, within limited budgets and time\
    \ frames,\nchoosing higher ﬂight altitudes may be more economical and feasible,\
    \ while lower ﬂight\naltitudes may be required for breeding research that demands\
    \ higher accuracy.\nSens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n15 of 19 \n \nFigure 10.\

    This study employed three diﬀerent machine learning algorithms—RFR, GBRT, RR,\
    \ \nLasso and SVR—for estimating wheat AGB. The experimental results demonstrated\
    \ that \nboth RFR methods outperformed other machine learning methods in estimating\

    \ These ﬁnd-\nings indicate that RFR and GBRT methods eﬀectively utilize information\
    \ from UAV RGB \nimages, thereby improving the accuracy of wheat AGB estimation.\
    \ The superiority of RFR \nand GBRT methods can be attributed to their utilization\
    \ of ensemble learning based on \ndecision trees, which helps mitigate noise eﬀects\
    \ by aggregating multiple decision trees \n[43,44]. Notably, the slight advantage\
    \ of RFR over GBRT may stem from the additional \nrandomness introduced in the\
    \ decision tree construction process, which reduces the risk \nof overﬁtting [45].\
    \ In comparison, SVR has the lowest estimation accuracy in this study, \nwhich\
    \ may be because SVR is more sensitive to data volume and data quality. If there\
    \ is \ninsuﬃcient data or outliers in the sample, the SVR model may not be able\
    \ to accurately \ncapture the pattern and trend of the data, resulting in a decrease\
    \ in estimation accuracy \n[28]. In addition, the RR and Lasso methods exhibited\
    \ lower performance in this experi-\nment. This could be attributed to the complex\
    \ nonlinear relationships between wheat AGB \nand various environmental factors\
    \ and remote sensing indices [46,47]. RR and Lasso are \nbased on linear relationships\
    \ and perform poorly in regression analysis of nonlinear data \n[18,33]. In contrast,\

    \ This study effectively\nimproves the accuracy of wheat AGB estimation by combining\

    \ of water for agricultural crops, an automated \nsoil moisture monitoring system\
    \ was created. A wirelessly dispersed \nnetwork of soil-moisture and temperature\
    \ sensors is employed in the system \nto monitor conditions in the root zone of\
    \ the plants. In addition to these \nfunctions, a gateway device can manage the\
    \ data collected by sensors, \ntrigger actuators, and transmit data to a web application.\
    \ A microcontroller-\nbased gateway was built with an algorithm that was based\
    \ on temperature \nand soil moisture threshold values for the purpose of managing\
    \ the amount \nof water that was available. The electricity for the system came\
    \ from \nphotovoltaic panels, and it had a bidirectional communication connection\
    \ \nthat was built on an interface between cellular technology and the internet.\
    \ \nThis gave customers the ability to plan watering and analyse data via a web\
    \ \npage. When compared to the conventional irrigation methods that are \nutilised\
    \ in the agricultural zone, the automated system's test run on a field \nof sage\
    \ crops resulted in water savings of up to 90 percent. The test lasted \nfor 120\
    \ days. Since its implementation 18 months ago, the automated \ntechnology has\
    \ been utilised effectively in all three of its designated places. \nDue to the\
    \ low cost and energy independence of the gadget, it has the \npotential to be\
    \ useful in places that have limited access to water and are \nlocated in remote\
    \ areas. \n \n1. \nIntroduction \nImproved agricultural production efficiency\
    \ without influencing these numerous aspects is a \ncore demand of agricultural\
    \ modernisation, and precision agriculture (PA) addresses this \nessential need.\
    \ The goal of farm automation technology is to improve object tracking and \n\
    trajectory identification for agricultural items. The data that is monitored,\
    \ recorded \nautomatically, gathered simply and efficiently serves as the foundation\
    \ for precision farming. \nBut over the past few years, technology has become\
    \ increasingly significant. Different \nautonomous vehicles from various fields\
    \ of operation have recently entered the market, but all \nof these impressive\
    \ products are commercially available and come at a significant cost to \nfarmers\
    \ (depending on their accuracy and functionality). All vehicle operations are\
    \ fully \nautonomous, and all control routines depend on a central processing\
    \ unit for coordination, \nwhich was created by numerous systems. However, these\
    \ systems are expensive per unit \nbecause the design facility's processing unit\
    \ is put under a lot of strain. The quantity of \nelectronic components on agricultural\
    \ equipment rises under regular field conditions, and \ncontrols as such as implement\
    \ system controllers, variable rate planter controllers, and spray \nrate controllers\
    \ interact with typical vehicle operation. As a consequence, every agricultural\
    \ \nmachinery now has a common communication connection. As a result, a new technique\
    \ was \nVol. 70 No. 1 (2021) \nhttp://philstat.org.ph \nMathematical Statistician\

    \ \n332 \nrequired for agricultural autonomous vehicles, which classifies various\
    \ solutions based on their \naccuracy and dependability and quantifies any auto-steering\
    \ system level performance. \nGiven the fundamental necessity to feed the world's\
    \ population, technology must be \nincorporated into the agricultural industry\
    \ to, among other things, lessen the negative effects \nthat crops have on the\
    \ environment and promote resource conservation. One of the key \nelements in\
    \ advancing the development of sustainable agriculture is efficient irrigation,\
    \ \nparticularly in arid and semi-arid areas where the biggest obstacles exist.\
    \ There are three \ngeneral categories into which irrigation techniques may be\
    \ divided: drip irrigation, sprinkler \nirrigation, and gravity irrigation. The\
    \ oldest and least effective approach for resource saving is \nthe gravity irrigation\
    \ system. However, sensing devices must be used to collect information \nsuch\
    \ as soil moisture in order to determine the precise irrigation requirements of\
    \ crops. \nThe idea of precision agriculture first gained traction in the USA\
    \ in the 1980s. It is a \nmanagement technique that enables decision-making to\
    \ raise agricultural output and produce \nmore sustainably. It is centered on\
    \ managing crops by tracking the variability of the numerous \nelements that impact\
    \ them and taking appropriate action. The soil where crops are grown may \nbe\
    \ monitored using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, allowing for better informed\
    \ decision-\nmaking and efficient watering. The employment of drones to assist\
    \ the network and control the \napplication of pesticides to crops is one of these\
    \ possibilities, in addition to the technological \nequipment already present\
    \ in the fields. However, it is crucial to be able to precisely control \nsoil\
    \ moisture levels when performing crop monitoring tasks, particularly in situations\
    \ where \nfruit trees are grown. Making ensuring the roots of a fruit tree obtain\
    \ the proper amounts of \nmoisture is essential for its growth. High humidity\
    \ may encourage the growth of fungus in the \nroots and leaves, which can have\
    \ an impact on productivity. However, the soil can crack if the \nmoisture content\
    \ is too low. resulting in the tree's death and shattered roots. This fact has\
    \ a \ndetrimental impact on plant growth, which in turn reduces plant yield. The\
    \ high cost of the \nsensors and other technologies used in precision agriculture\
    \ is one of its key downsides. Low-\ncost solutions must be made available in\
    \ order to facilitate deployments for farmers who wish \nto employ technology\
    \ extensively. \nVarious methodologies are utilised by the commercially available\
    \ soil monitoring sensors in \norder to ascertain the amount of water that is\
    \ contained within the ground. The gravimetric, \ntensiometric, neutronic, dielectric,\
    \ gamma-ray attenuation, Wenner or resistive, and infrared \nlight techniques\
    \ are the most effective ways that are now used for estimating the amount of \n\
    moisture that is present in the soil. When low-cost sensors are employed to evaluate\
    \ soil \nmoisture, conductivity-based sensors, which are typically based on the\
    \ use of two electrodes, \nare typically utilised. Lack of dependability and durability\
    \ are these sorts of sensors' two main \ndrawbacks. On the one hand, the conductivity\
    \ measurement may change even while the soil's \nwater content is constant depending\
    \ on the kind of soil and its salt concentration. On the other \nside, since the\
    \ electrodes must be in touch with the ground, they may degrade quickly. To detect\
    \ \nthe moisture of the soil, inductive sensors are also used. To read the parameters,\
    \ they do not, \nhowever, incorporate the system into a sensor node. \nVol. 70\

    \ found in far-off places. \nIt's possible that these places lack connection to\

    \ is that they eliminate the need for \ncostly and difficult to build cabled networks\
    \ across broad areas where equipment is utilised.  \nBut because of how the crops'\
    \ foliage affects the signal, there is less coverage between the \ndevices. In\
    \ light of the crop type and field size, it is vital to choose the best deployment\
    \ strategy \nfor the targeted area. Additionally, the protocols that are currently\
    \ in use might not offer all the \nfunctionalities needed for a specific crop\
    \ and the resources in the area. \nThis proposal's hierarchical layer structure,\
    \ where each layer includes a number of nodes that \nmay alter their roles as\
    \ needed, is one of its most distinguishing features. In other words, all \nactuator\
    \ nodes and sensor nodes are wireless systems with the capacity to relay packets.\
    \ If a \nnode were to hypothetically fail, communications may still be diverted\
    \ by other nodes in the \nsame tier. If numerous nodes fail and one of them is\
    \ still operational while being isolated, it \nmay still be able to communicate\
    \ via nodes on the higher or lower tier. These nodes would only \nsend the packet\
    \ to other nodes on the same layer as the isolated node. Establishing an alarm\
    \ \nsystem based on keep-alive messages is handy for dealing with the failure\
    \ of a sensor or \nactuator node. It is a daily chore that is periodically planned.\
    \ Because irrigating a field is not \nregarded as a critical task, it is possible\
    \ to work with a large periodicity. The system will treat \na node as down if\
    \ one or more nodes fail to reply to these queries. A low-cost method has to be\
    \ \ncreated in order to assess the moisture levels in the soil's depths. Four\
    \ coil-based sensor \ncomponents that are evenly spaced along 60 cm make up this\
    \ system. The coils are linked to a \nCPU module that is responsible for gathering\
    \ the data and wirelessly transmitting it to the other \nnodes in its group. Finally,\
    \ the actuator nodes will turn on or off the ditch gates or the drip \nirrigation\
    \ based on the moisture values that the sensor nodes have gathered. \nWe refer\
    \ to the quantity of water in the soil when we speak about moisture or soil humidity.\
    \ \nThe relative comparison between the dry soil mass and the moist soil mass—which\
    \ is usually \nhigher—is provided by the gravimetric analysis technique. The %\
    \ moisture is calculated by \nmultiplying the difference between these two numbers\
    \ by the bulk of dry soil. Moisture will be \n0% if there is no change. In the\
    \ opposite situation, the soil moisture level will be 100% when \nthe moistened\
    \ soil mass doubles the dry one. \n2. \nLiterature Survey \nIn recent years, the\
    \ implementation of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for soil moisture \nmonitoring\
    \ in precision agriculture has gained significant attention. This is primarily\
    \ due to the \nneed for accurate and timely soil moisture data to optimize irrigation,\
    \ minimize water waste, \nand increase crop yield. \nWireless sensor networks\
    \ are used in a unique system by Zheng Ma et al [1] to gather \nenvironmental\
    \ data in agriculture. The system's goal is to provide farmers with the data they\
    \ \nneed to make informed choices regarding irrigation and other environmental\

    \ nodes are equipped with a central processing unit that is used to \ncontrol\
    \ and monitor the environment of a particular location. They have a connection\
    \ to the \nBase Station, which acts as the central processing hub for the WSN\

    \ \n336 \nSoil moisture sensors have developed into a crucial instrument in contemporary\
    \ agriculture \nsince precise irrigation techniques have a direct impact on harvest\
    \ numbers. There are many \ndifferent kinds of sensors for measuring soil moisture,\
    \ but contemporary satellite sensors are \nin a class of their own since they\
    \ can monitor ground moisture levels remotely without having \nto be installed.\
    \ In many aspects of precision agriculture and associated sectors, we may utilize\
    \ \nthe data collected by soil moisture sensor systems to make smarter judgments.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. Real time Wireless Sensor for soil moisture monitoring \nOne\
    \ of the key components of smart farming is the use of soil moisture sensors.\
    \ They are \nalways changing to make them more user-friendly. Modern smart soil\
    \ moisture sensors may \nsend data wirelessly, be installed at different depths,\
    \ and upload readings immediately to a GIS \ndatabase, removing the need for human\
    \ data collecting. This is in contrast to earlier, more \nlaborious approaches.\
    \  \nSensors are also being portable; thus they are not only confined to being\
    \ stationary. With \nportable devices as opposed to stationary ones, data can\
    \ be collected from any location and \ndepth. The varieties of soil moisture sensors\
    \ available depend on the underlying technology. \nimplanted in the ground to\
    \ check on the condition of the root zone; Unmanned aerial vehicle \n(UAV) airborne\
    \ data retrieval, a rare method in soil moisture mapping; using a satellite to\
    \ assess \nthe situation from orbit. They help save money, don't need labour-intensive\
    \ installations, and \ndon't obstruct field operations. Maintaining enough water\
    \ saturation is the farmer's first priority \nsince it is essential for plant\
    \ growth. Lack of irrigation causes fading because plants need all of \ntheir\
    \ energy to absorb little water via their roots, leaving insufficient energy for\
    \ the crop to \ndevelop and produce well. However, enough moisture enables the\
    \ plants to survive frequent \nstressors, remain healthy, and develop to their\
    \ full potential. On the other side, over watering \nresults in root rot, obstructs\
    \ the oxygen flow, and ultimately kills the plant. As can be seen, \nwithout maintaining\
    \ steady water content levels, things may go anyway. Due to the efficiency, \n\
    dependability, and affordability of online agricultural apps with soil moisture\
    \ characteristics, \nsoil moisture sensors for agriculture are essential farming\
    \ instruments. When compared to the \namount of time and effort needed to use\
    \ them and the quantity and quality of data they can \nproduce, satellite remote\
    \ sensors are an excellent value. They enable farmers to more skilfully \ncontrol\
    \ risks associated with water shortage and excess, which enhances plant development.\
    \ \nThis is made possible by their incorporation into regular agricultural practices.\

  analysis: 'This study examines the use of genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm
    optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA) to optimize the data transmission
    paths of sensors for pest monitoring. The results indicate that the optimized
    path based on PSO can significantly reduce the time used for transmitting data
    compared to GA and SA. This method can enhance the transmission efficiency of
    agricultural pest monitoring data and support the development of effective pest
    control strategies. The authors acknowledge that while PSO demonstrates superior
    performance in path optimization, future research should explore hybrid algorithms
    that combine the strengths of multiple techniques to further improve transmission
    speed and minimize energy consumption.


    Specific verbatim quotes demonstrating the relevance of the paper to the outline
    point and review intention are as follows:


    **Verbatim_quote1**: “To achieve efﬁcient and real-time transmission of the sensors’
    data for pest monitoring, this paper selects 235 geographic coordinates of agricultural
    pest monitoring points and uses genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization
    (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA) to optimize the data transmission paths of
    sensors.” This text highlights that the study specifically addresses the optimization
    of data transmission paths for pest monitoring using different algorithms, thereby
    addressing the point of “Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature,
    weather) and their collection and use” within the context of automated irrigation
    management.

    the practical significance of the research in enhancing pest monitoring data transmission
    efficiency and its implications for developing effective pest control strategies,
    which is directly relevant to the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness
    of automated irrigation management systems.'

    \ for improving the transmission efﬁciency of\nagricultural pest monitoring data,\

    \ amounts of fossil fuels has accelerated global warming since the\n20th century,\
    \ and atmospheric temperatures and sea levels are rising at an unprecedented\n\
    rate [1]. It is expected that the global average temperature will rise by 1.5–4.5\
    \ ◦C by the\nend of this century [2]. Insects are typically poikilotherm, and\
    \ temperature is the most\nimportant environmental factor affecting insect population\
    \ dynamics. Climate warming\npresent a series of inﬂuences on pests, such as expanding\
    \ the range of ﬁtness zones [3],\nincreasing the survival rate of overwintering,\
    \ increasing the number of generations [4],\nand increasing the risk of spreading\
    \ crop diseases. These effects may cause sudden local\noutbreaks or migrations\
    \ of pest populations, reduce crop yields, affect normal crop growth\nand development,\
    \ and even cause massive crop mortality and severe crop failure, thus\npresenting\
    \ a serious threat to the quality and safety of agricultural products. Once crop\n\
    yields are severely affected, it can cause local crop supply and demand to be\
    \ relatively tight,\nmaking the price of food products remarkable high and hindering\
    \ the steady improvement\nof a region’s agricultural economy. This means that\
    \ the agricultural pests cause huge\neconomic losses as well as presenting a remarkable\
    \ threat to food safety [5,6]. Only through\neffective monitoring methods to achieve\
    \ early warning of pest occurrence can we reduce\nagricultural losses and ensure\
    \ the safety of edible farm products.\nTraditionally, the acquisition of pest\
    \ information is mainly performed by manual ﬁeld\nsurvey and identiﬁcation statistics,\
    \ and the monitoring of pest situations is based on the\nBiosensors 2022, 12,\
    \ 948. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12110948\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\n\
    Biosensors 2022, 12, 948\n2 of 12\nmanual survey, which is a method with high\
    \ workload, low efﬁciency, poor reliability, and\nlow accuracy [7,8]. Agricultural\
    \ pest monitoring and identiﬁcation using the Internet of\nThings (IoT) has become\
    \ an important component of the agricultural pest control category\nwith the advent\
    \ of Industry 4.0. Combining agriculture with modern electronic information\n\
    industries such as communications and sensors has greatly improved the efﬁciency\
    \ and\naccuracy of pest monitoring and identiﬁcation. Gassoumi et al. designed\
    \ a computer vision-\nbased insect classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation system for\
    \ cotton ﬁelds, using an artiﬁcial\nneural network approach to classify 12 insect\
    \ species in cotton ﬁelds, the recognition\nrate of 11 insect species reached\
    \ more than 90%, and the recognition rate of only one\ninsect was 72% [9]. Based\
    \ on the existing light trapping technology, an automatic pest\ncollection device\
    \ that can be used for cruciferous major insect pest detection was studied\nand\
    \ designed. Using this device, images of cruciferous major pests can be collected,\n\
    ﬂipped, and vibrated according to the real-time situation of pest images, which\
    \ effectively\nimproves the quality of image collection and recognition accuracy,\
    \ and the recognition\nerror is less than 5% [10]. Based on a wireless network\
    \ image sensors system, a pest\nremote automatic monitoring and early warning\
    \ system was designed, which uses the\ntechnique of background differencing to\
    \ achieve pest counting and sends an early warning\nmessage when the pest density\
    \ is greater than a threshold value [11]. Pest monitoring and\nidentiﬁcation technology\
    \ are continuously optimized and the accuracy is continuously\nimproved, but multiple\
    \ monitoring points are often set up in the process of agricultural\npest monitoring\
    \ in the ﬁeld. The network will be blocked when the number of monitoring\npoints\
    \ increases or during the peak of pest occurrence, which will delay or collapse\
    \ the data\ntransmission, thus limiting the real-time monitoring of agricultural\
    \ pests. As a result, the\ninformation on the species and quantity of pests cannot\
    \ be obtained in time, and effective\npest control strategies cannot be formulated.\
    \ Therefore, it is urgent to increase research on\nthe optimization of sensors’\
    \ data transmission paths for pest monitoring to achieve efﬁcient\nand real-time\
    \ transmission of multi-point data in the process of pest monitoring.\nGenetic\
    \ algorithm (GA), swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA)\nare\
    \ all bionic intelligence algorithms which are widely used in industry, agriculture,\
    \ and\nmedicine to ﬁnd optimal solutions [11]. GA, also known as the evolutionary\
    \ algorithm (EA),\nis a heuristic algorithm based on the process of biological\
    \ evolution. Its main feature is the\nselection of the solution to the problem\
    \ based on the “survival of the ﬁttest” or “competition”\nmethod of biological\
    \ evolution [12]. GA is based on all individuals in a population and\nuses randomization\
    \ techniques to guide an efﬁcient search of coded parameter space.\nAmong them,\
    \ selection, crossover, and mutation constitute the genetic operations of GA;\n\
    ﬁve elements, namely, parameter encoding, initial population setting, design of\
    \ ﬁtness\nfunction, design of genetic operations, and setting of control parameters,\
    \ form the core of\nGA [13]. GA has been widely used in the ﬁelds of combinatorial\
    \ optimization, machine\nlearning, signal processing, adaptive control, and artiﬁcial\
    \ life, and it is one of the key\ntechniques in modern relevant intelligent computing\
    \ [14]. Zhang tested the performance of\nthe improved GA on the transmission path\
    \ of wireless Mesh network through simulation\nto optimize the transmission path\
    \ of marine data and improve the efﬁciency of marine data\ntransmission [15].\
    \ PSO, also known as the birds’ ﬂock foraging algorithm, is a new EA\ndeveloped\
    \ by Kennedy and Eberhart et al. in recent years. The PSO starts from a random\n\
    solution, ﬁnds the optimal solution by iteration, evaluates the quality of the\
    \ solution\nby ﬁtness, and follows the current searched optimal value to ﬁnd the\
    \ global optimal.\nThis algorithm has attracted the attention of academics for\
    \ its easy implementation, high\naccuracy, and fast convergence, and has demonstrated\
    \ its superiority in solving practical\nproblems [16]. Ma et al. applied the PSO\
    \ to the medical ﬁeld, and the research based\non the PSO will use a multi-PSO\
    \ for path planning to effectively reduce the path search\nrange and improve the\
    \ path search speed [17]. SA is a general probabilistic heuristic\nalgorithm for\
    \ combinatorial optimization problems to ﬁnd a global optimal solution and\nan\
    \ approximate optimal solution in a large global search space [18]. The SA is\
    \ often used\nfor searching in discrete spaces; it will be more effective than\
    \ the exhaustive method for\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 948\n3 of 12\nsome problems\
    \ because it aims to ﬁnd a good solution in an acceptable time, rather than\n\
    the best solution [19]. Based on the SA, Liu et al. proposed an optimal design\
    \ method\nfor the heat extraction section of the energy tunnel, which effectively\
    \ improved the heat\ntransfer efﬁciency and reduced the construction cost [20].\
    \ The sensors’ data transmission\npaths for pest monitoring are optimized based\
    \ on GA, PSO, and SA in our study (Figure 1),\nand the data transmission speed\
    \ is compared and analyzed after the optimized paths,\nwhich improves the transmission\
    \ efﬁciency of agricultural pest monitoring data, provides\na guarantee for the\
    \ formulation of effective agricultural pest control strategies, and reduces\n\
    the threat of pest damage to the quality and safety of farm products.\nimplementation,\
    \ high accuracy, and fast convergence, and has demonstrated its superior-\nity\
    \ in solving practical problems [16]. Ma et al. applied the PSO to the medical\
    \ field, and \nthe research based on the PSO will use a multi-PSO for path planning\
    \ to effectively reduce \nthe path search range and improve the path search speed\
    \ [17]. SA is a general probabilistic \nheuristic algorithm for combinatorial\
    \ optimization problems to find a global optimal so-\nlution and an approximate\
    \ optimal solution in a large global search space [18]. The SA is \noften used\
    \ for searching in discrete spaces; it will be more effective than the exhaustive\
    \ \nmethod for some problems because it aims to find a good solution in an acceptable\

    \ an optimal design \nmethod for the heat extraction section of the energy tunnel,\
    \ which effectively improved \nthe heat transfer efficiency and reduced the construction\
    \ cost [20]. The sensors’ data trans-\nmission paths for pest monitoring are optimized\
    \ based on GA, PSO, and SA in our study \n(Figure 1), and the data transmission\
    \ speed is compared and analyzed after the optimized \npaths, which improves the\

    \ moment t is denoted by Xi.t = [xi.t.1, xi.t.2, · · · , xi.t.n].\nThe velocity\
    \ of the ﬁrst particle at moment t is denoted by Vi.t = [vi.t.1, vi.t.2, · · ·\

    Internet technology is a new distributed sensors network and information transmission\n\
    network integrating various sensing technologies, modern communication technologies,\n\
    artiﬁcial intelligence, and automatic control. It has been widely used in insect\
    \ monitoring\nand early warning, as well as agricultural product traceability,\
    \ etc. [21,22]. Agricultural\npests are characterized by a wide range of species,\
    \ large numbers, wide distribution,\nand serious damage, which makes the monitoring\
    \ and integrated prevention and control\nof agricultural pests particularly important.\
    \ In the process of monitoring agricultural\npests in the ﬁeld, considering the\
    \ mobility and random rows of agricultural pests, a large\nnumber of monitoring\
    \ points need to be set up in the monitoring area, which facilitates\nthe construction\
    \ of a sensors network for pest monitoring and maximizes the collection\nof pest\
    \ information [23]. However, the interconnection of multiple monitoring points\n\
    means that the sensors’ data transmission from monitoring nodes to aggregation\
    \ nodes\nmay have a large amount of redundant data, making the monitoring network\
    \ congested or\neven collapsing, resulting in failure to receive timely pest information.\
    \ A total of 235 pest\nmonitoring points were selected and the sensors’ data transmission\
    \ paths were optimized\nbased on three bionic intelligent algorithms (GA, PSO,\
    \ and SA) in our study to improve the\nsensors’ data transmission efﬁciency for\
    \ pest monitoring. The data transmission completion\ntime was 262.738048 s after\
    \ optimization using GA, 4.868012 s for PSO, and 17.842523 s\nfor SA. The transmission\
    \ time after optimization based on PSO was much lower than that\nof GA and SA,\
    \ which shows that the PSO presents the best effect on the optimization of\nsensors’\
    \ data transmission path. Zhu et al. proposed a target recognition method based\n\
    on PSO for data transmission path in wireless sensor networks, with an average\
    \ delay of\n1.8 µs. The transmission energy consumption and delay are reduced\
    \ [24].\nThe GA is a computational model of the biological evolutionary process\
    \ that simulates\nthe natural selection and genetics mechanism of Darwinian biological\
    \ evolution, the PSO\nis an intelligent algorithm designed by simulating the predatory\
    \ behavior of a ﬂock of\nbirds, and the SA is derived from the principle of solid\
    \ annealing. All three algorithms\nare heuristic algorithms, which are mathematical\
    \ simulations of natural processes, and\nall are global optimization-seeking algorithms\
    \ [25]. The GA has a strong global search\ncapability and can jump out of the\
    \ local optimum well, but it has a slow convergence,\nlong running time, and insufﬁcient\
    \ local search capability; the PSO is simple to operate,\nand does not require\
    \ complex behaviors such as population selection, crossover, and\nmutation, it\
    \ runs fast but has the risk of falling into the local optimum solution; the SA\
    \ has a\nstrong local search capability, short running time, and poor global search\
    \ capability [26,27].\nPremalatha et al. proposed a hybrid algorithm PSO-GA based\
    \ on GA, which applied the\nvariation of GA to PSO and avoided the PSO to fall\
    \ into the local optimal solution [28].\nDa et al. proposed an improved PSO algorithm\
    \ based on the SA technique, and the results\nshowed that the SAPSO-based artiﬁcial\
    \ neural network presents a better ability to escape\nfrom local optimum and is\
    \ more effective than the traditional PSO-based artiﬁcial neural\nnetwork [29].\
    \ A hybrid algorithm using a combination of GA and SA is proposed to\nsolve the\
    \ shortest path optimization problem of undirected networks, which prevents\n\
    the occurrence of premature maturation, ensures the diversity of the population,\
    \ and can\neffectively prevent the occurrence of falling into the local optimal\
    \ search situation [30]. The\nthree algorithms are pairwise combined into the\
    \ hybrid algorithm, which can effectively\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 948\n11 of 12\n\
    complement the prematurity of GA, and the disadvantages of convergence speed decrease\n\
    and similarity increase due to the random search algorithm. The sensors’ data\
    \ transmission\npaths were optimized based on each of the three algorithms and\
    \ compared in our study, and\nif the hybrid algorithm can be used in combination\
    \ with the agricultural pest monitoring\ndata transmission, the sensors’ data\
    \ transmission path is further optimized.\nIn the process of agricultural pest\
    \ monitoring, the performance of sensor nodes plays\na decisive role in data transmission\
    \ [31]. The speed of sensors’ data transmission for\npest monitoring is guaranteed,\
    \ and the data can be transmitted in real-time to develop\npest control strategies\
    \ in time after using PSO to optimize the path, but the sensor nodes\nare powered\
    \ by batteries, which have limited energy and are extremely inconvenient\nto charge\
    \ [32]. The lifetime of sensor nodes depends on the battery life, and excessive\n\
    energy loss can cause the premature end of the agricultural pest monitoring network\
    \ [33].\nTherefore, while considering the transmission speed, the energy required\
    \ for sensors’ data\ntransmission also needs to be considered. Yang proposed a\
    \ high-energy data transmission\noptimization algorithm-OTCEE based on tree-cluster\
    \ topology, which reduces the energy\nloss of sensor nodes and delays the death\
    \ of nodes [34]. Abhishek et al. developed an\nenergy-saving scheme based on PSO\
    \ optimization and GA optimization techniques, which\nsolves the sensor node energy\
    \ consumption fast [35]. Therefore, the efﬁciency of sensors’\ndata transmission\
    \ for pest monitoring will be greatly improved if an algorithm can be\ndesigned\
    \ to maximize the transmission speed and minimize the energy consumption.\n5.\
    \ Conclusions\nIn conclusion, this study uses three intelligent algorithms (GA,\
    \ PSO, and SA) to\noptimize the data transmission paths of the sensors, and the\
    \ optimization results are\ncompared and analyzed. The results show that the optimized\
    \ path based on PSO presents\nthe shortest time used for transmitting data, and\
    \ its minimum time is 4.868012 s. This\nstudy can provide a reference for improving\
    \ the sensors’ data transmission efﬁciency for\nagricultural pest monitoring,\
    \ and guarantee the development of real-time and effective\npest control programs.\n\

  limitations: Although the study provides valuable insights into optimizing data
    transmission paths for pest monitoring using intelligent algorithms, it has some
    limitations. The research primarily focuses on the optimization of data transmission
    paths without considering the impact on energy consumption. Future studies should
    explore hybrid algorithms that combine the advantages of different techniques
    to simultaneously optimize transmission speed and minimize energy usage in wireless
    sensor networks.

    on Intelligent Algorithms
  verbatim_quote1: To achieve efﬁcient and real-time transmission of the sensors’
    data for pest monitoring, this paper selects 235 geographic coordinates of agricultural
    pest monitoring points and uses genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization
    (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA) to optimize the data transmission paths of
    sensors.”
  verbatim_quote2: The three intelligent algorithms are simulated by MATLAB software.
    The results show that the optimized path based on PSO can make the shortest time
    used for transmitting data, and its corresponding minimum time is 4.868012 s.”

  analysis: Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather)
    and their collection and use are critical requirements in automated systems for
    real-time irrigation management. This study introduces a protocol that integrates
    IoT with machine learning for optimizing the automated irrigation management system
    to improve water efficiency and enhance agricultural productivity. The optimal
    cluster heads are selected using a hybrid approach that combines ant colony optimization
    (ACO) and the cuckoo search algorithm. ACO is also utilized to optimize the data
    transmission process from cluster heads to the base station. Results demonstrate
    the protocol's ability to extend system lifespan, reduce delivery delay, and improve
    energy efficiency. The suggested protocol has the potential to address the global
    food challenge by optimizing water resources and enhancing agricultural output.

    interconnect with each other using Internet and provide much useful information\
    \ for various purposes.\nThese network are often backed by WSNs where sensors\
    \ play a signi¦cant part in gathering\nenvironmental data; this data is processed\
    \ and used by IoT devices for numerous applications. This\npaper proposes agricultural\
    \ application of IoT where the soil moisture content is continuously monitored\n\
    such that excess watering can be avoided; this leads to water conservation in\
    \ addition to preventing the\ncrop damage. Furthermore, sensors also monitor the\
    \ environmental parameters which are responsible for\ncausing ¦re in the ¦elds.\
    \ This information is sent to the server where it can be processed and damage\
    \ to\ncrops can be avoided. The clustering approach has been suggested for underlying\
    \ sensor system where\nthe main objective function of augmenting the network lifetime\
    \ and reducing the data delivery delay has\nbeen laid out. The cuckoo search optimization\
    \ (CS) has been used in unison with ant colony algorithm\n(ACO) to select the\
    \ optimal cluster heads. The tra¨c heterogeneity scenario has been considered\
    \ in the\nnetwork where the ¦re sensors has more data to forward to base station\
    \ as compared to moisture\nsensors; this tra¨c heterogeneity has been primarily\
    \ considered which choosing the optimal CH.\nFurthermore, the information transmission\
    \ process from CH to BS is also optimized by forming the paths\nusing ACO and\
    \ selecting one best out of them for data forwarding. The suggested approach was\n\
    experiment in MATLAB & contrasted compared with other protocols namely GWO, ESO,\
    \ GECR and LEACH\nbased on average residual energy of the system, network stability,\
    \ network lifetime and delivery delay.\nThe suggested approach has managed to\
    \ achieve good system lifespan & less delivery delays.\n1. Introduction\nThe IoT\
    \ term used to describe the expanding network of physical things that are equipped\
    \ with sensors,\nsoftware, and other capabilities that enable them to communicate\
    \ and share data over the internet in\norder to carry out speci¦c duties [1].\
    \ This technology has been rapidly gaining popularity over the last few\nyears\
    \ because of capability to revolutionize the way we live & work. IoT has numerous\
    \ applications\nacross various industries such as smart homes, agriculture, smart\
    \ watches used in healthcare etc [2].\nThis technology can improve e¨ciency, reduce\
    \ costs, and enhance safety. Connected devices can provide\nfarmers with real-time\
    \ data about soil moisture, temperature, & an- other environmental factors that\n\
    impact crop development. This data could be used to optimize irrigation schedules\
    \ as well as fertilizer\napplication, resulting in higher crop yields and reduced\
    \ water usage. The data also be backed up to the\nlocal cloud and processing can\
    \ be done where future decisions can also be made based in analytical\nresults\
    \ [3]. The various applications mentioned here require the use of sensors to fetch\
    \ the readings from\nthe environment; this makes the sensor network act as a primary\
    \ component of IoT [4]. The reading from\nvarious sensors can augment the use\
    \ of available resources [5].\nWith ever increasing number of applications, the\
    \ quick development of the required devices has led to\nproblems related to energy\
    \ consumption [6]; furthermore the sensors used in the IoT application need to\n\
    perform e¨ciently over longer time period as well [7]. In order to solve the issues\
    \ related to improving the\nPage 3/29\nlifetime of sensors, clustering is one\
    \ of the famous approaches practiced by the researchers [8]. In this\napproach,\
    \ the system is categorized into clusters with every cluster having one CH and\
    \ other nodes in its\nvicinity act as cluster members; the main role of forwarding\
    \ the information from members to BS is\ncarried out by the head [9]. However,\
    \ the most imperative process in this is related to selection of optimal\nCH &\
    \ data transmission from head to server or BS.. Various studies have used optimization\
    \ schemes for\ncluster head’s as well as data transmission method’s optimization;\
    \ these can be seen in [10], [11], [12],\n[13], [14], [15]. This paper suggests\
    \ an optimal CH selection approach which makes use of ACO as well as\nCS algorithm\
    \ in a hybrid way. Firstly, ACO is used to compute probability of nodes to become\
    \ cluster head\nwhich is then used as input for CS algorithm to ¦nd the optimized\
    \ solution. Furthermore, the data\ntransmission process towards the base station\
    \ has also been optimized using ACO. The research paper\nproposed the clustering\
    \ technique which can be useful for agricultural application related to monitoring\n\
    of soil moisture content and environmental factors that lead to ¦res in the ¦elds.\
    \ The tra¨c heterogeneity\nconcept has been put forward in this paper as it is\
    \ assumed that ¦re sensors have more data to forward\nas compared to moisture\
    \ sensors. The heads are optimized taking into account type of data sensed by\n\
    the sensors with the main aim of reducing the energy usage of the sensors and\
    \ data transmission delay.\nThe structure of the paper is formulated as follows:\
    \ Section 2 outlines the existing study done in the ¦eld\nof cluster head and\
    \ data transmission optimization for WSNs. Section 3 represents the motivation\
    \ and\ncontribution of this research paper. Network model has been shown in section\
    \ 4. The suggested protocol\nhas been detailed in Section 5 and the outcomes have\
    \ been discussed in the following section. The paper\nhas been ¦nally concluded\
    \ in section 7.\n2. Related work\nThe researchers in [16] have developed an application\
    \ for smart farming using WSN where the clustering\ntechnique has been employed.\
    \ They have used Bacteria Forging Optimization algorithm to evaluate the\n¦tness\
    \ of every sensor which is computed using cross layer parameters; they have managed\
    \ to achieve\nbetter network’s lifespan and lessened the packet transmission delay.\
    \ The research in [17] has made use\nof genetic algorithm for selecting the best\
    \ node for the part of CH in network and the study [18] optimizes\nthe CH selection\
    \ in WSN consisting of multiple tiers of the nodes in context of their batteries.\
    \ The authors\nin [19] have made use of fuzzy c means approach to optimize the\
    \ cluster formation in a way that the\ndistance among different cluster heads\
    \ (which are chosen using fuzzy rules) is least. Network stability\nperiod has\
    \ been optimized in [20] by adding some extra nodes in the network with higher\
    \ energy and\ncorrespondingly choosing the optimal cluster heads according to\
    \ energy parameter. However, a node\npossess various parameters which can be considered\
    \ for its selection as optimal head; this fact was\npondered upon by the authors\
    \ in [21] where a total of 20 attributes have been examined for head\nselection\
    \ process using multi attribute decision making approaches with a goal of optimizing\
    \ the energy\nconsumption in the WSN. Another study which aims to improve energy\
    \ e¨ciency for IoT enabled network\nhas focused on harvesting the energy at base\
    \ station using solar power. This research [22] has makes an\nestimate of how\
    \ much energy is required by the base station by making use of product density\
    \ model.\nAnother study [23] makes use of fuzzy rules to select the cluster head\
    \ and fuzzy c means for forming the\nPage 4/29\nclusters. Furthermore, the authors\
    \ make use of sleep scheduling policy to reduce the set of active nodes\ninvolved\
    \ in transmitting the data towards the BS. This helps in improving the energy\
    \ e¨ciency of the\nsystem.\nWhilst these researches have focused more on optimal\
    \ selection of cluster heads, other studies do focus\non optimizing the data collection\
    \ process as well. One of such studies can be seen in [24] where, apart\nfrom\
    \ selecting the cluster heads using Harris Hawks optimization technique, two new\
    \ things have been\nproposed; these include introduction of sleep scheduling for\
    \ the cluster members having energy below\nthan threshold and the use of agents\
    \ to gather information from the CH. Similar to this, the authors in [25]\ninitially\
    \ made use of fractional gravitation search optimization approach to choose the\
    \ optimal CH and\nthen optimized the data transmission using multi path routing\
    \ process. The intermediate nodes in the\noptimized path are selected using another\
    \ optimization named as tunicate swarm grey wolf optimization\nwhere the ¦tness\
    \ value for each node is evaluated based on distance among the nodes, their remaining\n\
    energy etc. The authors in [26] focused on achieving load balancing by optimizing\
    \ the path selection\nprocess using sea gull optimization method whereas the clustering\
    \ has been carried out by using fuzzy c\nmeans algorithm. In order to improve\
    \ latency and delay in the IoT network, the authors in [27] have\nproposed another\
    \ clustering based protocol where the cross layer parameters (from network, physical\
    \ and\nmac layer) are used for optimal cluster head selection. Furthermore, the\
    \ routing process is optimized\nusing ant colony optimization algorithm where\
    \ the intermediate nodes in the route are chosen using the\nsame probability value\
    \ (computed using cross layer parameters) which was used for selection of CH in\n\
    the former phase. The authors in [28] have made use of Fuzzy AHP and TOPSIS to\
    \ select optimal cluster\nheads from the grids in the network; the features of\
    \ the nodes that were considered for making this\nselection were the energy and\
    \ position of the nodes along with their quality of service parameters. This\n\
    research used emperor penguin optimization for optimizing the multi hop data transmission\
    \ from head to\nthe server. The authors in [29] have considered achieving the\
    \ energy e¨ciency in the system not only by\nchoosing the optimal CH to by automating\
    \ aking use of threshold energy where the nodes having energy\nmore than this\
    \ benchmark are retained as heads in the next round as well, thereby reducing\
    \ the cluster\nformation costs. The authors in [30] have made use of ¦xed as well\
    \ as mobile nodes; the cluster heads\nare optimized from the set of ¦xed nodes\
    \ which receive data from the other mobile sensors. The data is\ntransmitted to\
    \ base station using data fusion method by ¦xed nodes only which perform the function\
    \ of\nrelay nodes as well. Their selection in the routing path is dependent upon\
    \ their ¦tness value. The authors\nin [31] have used grey wolf optimization not\
    \ only to achieve the goal of energy e¨ciency in the network\nbut also to minimize\
    \ the delay as well. The CH selection has been optimized using this approach and\n\
    multiple factors have been used to compute the ¦tness of the nodes. The data transmission\
    \ has been\ndone using the concept of relay node which is selected taking into\
    \ account the congestion level of the\ncluster heads in additional to energy and\
    \ distance.\nApart from optimizing the data transmission process using multi hop\
    \ routing as discussed in earlier\nrelated works, the researchers in [32] have\
    \ made use of mobile sinks to gather data from the network.\nThey have designed\
    \ two routing algorithms for this purpose; one is based on Brownian motion while\
    \ the\nother proposes a ¦xed trajectory to be followed by the sink node. Similar\
    \ study can be observed in [33]\nPage 5/29\nwhere the trajectory of the mobile\
    \ sink node is optimized for data collection from sensors. Then the route\nis\
    \ formed from sensors to the mobile sink tree where the intermediate nodes are\
    \ selected using frontward\ncommunication area technique. The researchers in [34]\
    \ have also made use of mobile sink to gather data\nfrom the CH. They have formed\
    \ the super clusters among the cluster heads and then optimized the\ntrajectory\
    \ for the mobile agent to gather information from them. Another research has been\
    \ done in [35]\nwhich focuses more on optimizing the packet transmission process\
    \ than cluster head selection. The\nheads are normally elected based on remaining\
    \ energy and distance; the routing scheme has been\noptimized using backpressure\
    \ scheduling method for data packets. It aims at avoiding the redundant\ndata\
    \ transmission and queues the packets accordingly. Correspondingly, the intermediate\
    \ nodes in the\nrouting path are selected using length of the queue of the respective\
    \ nodes. To reduce the issues related\nto gathering of large amount of information,\
    \ the authors in [36] have proposed clustering algorithm for\ninformation centric\
    \ WSN. In this, while the CH have been chosen using the black widow optimization,\
    \ the\ndata transmission has been optimized using arti¦cial bee colony algorithm.\
    \ Another study [37] focuses\non improving the lifespan of the system by reducing\
    \ the amount of data sent by the SN. The author\nproposes a technique that uses\
    \ data correlation and then mathematically retrieves a part of the data\nwhich\
    \ can then be avoided for transmission; this helps in enhancing the lifespan of\
    \ the system. The\nresearchers in [38] have utilize compressed sensing technique\
    \ to obtain energy e¨ciency in IoT system.\nThe data is forecasted, grouped into\
    \ different categories and is synchronized in the cloud; if any current\nsensed\
    \ data belongs to some new category apart from those already existing/forecasted\
    \ in the cloud,\nonly then the data needs to be transmitted thus saving the energy\
    \ of the nodes.\n3. Motivation and contribution\nThe existing schemes that have\
    \ focused on achieving energy e¨ciency in IoT networks backed by WSN\nhave resorted\
    \ to clustering methods. In this, majority of the work is focused on optimal selection\
    \ of\ncluster heads. This has been done using the simple ¦tness computation of\
    \ the IoT nodes or by using\nfuzzy rules or some optimization algorithms. Furthermore,\
    \ some of the research works focus on relaying\nthe data from heads towards the\
    \ server. In these methods, they have formulated multiple paths from\nsource cluster\
    \ heads and the intermediate nodes have been chosen according to optimization\
    \ algorithms\nin most of the schemes. The use of mobile sinks has also been witnessed\
    \ in the existing research\nmethods for data collection from the sensors. While\
    \ most of the methods have provided generalized\nprocedures to optimize the energy\
    \ consumption in the network, very few or none have been designed as\nper the\
    \ requirements of the application area. Since this work considers the agricultural\
    \ applications of IoT\nnetwork, the protocol has been designed taking into different\
    \ tra¨c type sensed by different sensor\nnodes. Therefore, it addresses the research\
    \ gap of the existing schemes as well by designing the protocol\nas per the requirements\
    \ of the application.\nThis protocol can ¦nd its use in following applications\
    \ related to:\na) Controlling soil moisture content: Since one type of sensor\
    \ deployed in the region of interest (farm) is\nthe soil moisture sensor; its\
    \ sole work is to report the data related to moisture content to the destination.\n\
    Page 6/29\nThe destination can be hand held mobile device of the farmer; once\
    \ intimated about the decreasing\nmoisture content, the farmer can manually turn\
    \ on the irrigation valve. Or the destination can be some\nserver where the processing\
    \ of the data will be performed; once the dropping moisture content is detected,\n\
    the signal can be sent to internet controlled valve (an IOT device) which can\
    \ then irrigate the ¦eld\ncorrespondingly. The valve can be turned on and off\
    \ such that just enough water required is released in\nthe soil. These sensors\
    \ can transmit the data hourly to the destination or can transmit only in certain\n\
    cases where the moisture content drops below threshold value.\nb) Protecting crops\
    \ from ¦re: It has been observed that high temperatures and low humidity are the\
    \ main\ndriving environmental factors which lead to ¦re incidents [39]; this requires\
    \ the use of temperature as well\nas humidity sensors to be readily deployed in\
    \ the ¦eld. These sensors require the continuous data\ntransmission about the\
    \ sensed environmental factors (as compared to soil moisture sensor which needs\n\
    to send data only when moisture content is falling below a certain level) to the\
    \ server; when abnormal\nreadings are detected, the signal can be sent to the\
    \ IOT enabled cold water sprinklers which can be used\nto bring the temperature\
    \ of the surroundings down and increase the water content in the atmosphere as\n\
    well. This is one of the low cost solution the can be implemented, however the\
    \ use of drones is also\nrecommended in the literature which sprinkle the water\
    \ to bring down the temperature but this is a costly\nsolution for the farmers.\
    \ In either of the case, the sensors have to timely report the data to the IOT\
    \ device\neither directly or via the server such that large ¦re breaking incidents\
    \ can be controlled.\n4. Network Model\nNode type: Since, this protocol is being\
    \ developed for two main applications for the agriculture,\ntherefore, the type\
    \ of sensors deployed in the ¦eld will be different. These sensors will be moisture\n\
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors which makes the environment a heterogeneous\
    \ type.\nApart from this, all the other features of the sensors in context of\
    \ their processing power, energy etc.\nwill be same.\nDeployment Scenario: The\
    \ system area is examined as rectangular shaped where all the sensors will\nbe\
    \ deployed randomly. However, the sensors will have different set of information\
    \ to be distributed to\nthe BS. As discussed above, temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ will be sending more data as\ncompared to the moisture sensors.\nEnergy Model:\
    \ Whenever, the nodes have to communicate with others in their vicinity, they\
    \ will follow\n¦rst order radio energy model to compute their energy dissipation\
    \ [40]. Any time there is intra-cluster\ndata connection, the energy used by the\
    \ members to transfer data to the cluster head or any\nmessage the cluster head\
    \ relays to its members is precisely inversely proportional to d2. In particular,\n\
    the energy required to send a packet from a CH to a BS across a greater distance\
    \ is precisely\nproportional to d4. The amount of energy used during packet transmission\
    \ can be expressed as:\nEtx = { Ps. Eelec + Ps. Efsd2, d < d0\nPs. Eelec + Ps.\
    \ Eampd4, d ≥ d0\nPage 7/29\nWhere\nPs stands for packet size, and Eelec, Eamp,\
    \ or Efs are, respectively, parameters for electronics, ampli¦ers,\nand free space\
    \ energy.\nThe receiver uses energy regardless of how far two nodes are from one\
    \ another. The energy used is\ndetermined by:\nThe various symbols and notations\

    5. Cluster head Selection using Hybrid Cuckoo Search and Multi\nObjective Ant\
    \ Colony Optimization\nThe idea of using cuckoo search optimization technique\
    \ for cluster head selection stems from the fact\nthat it not only uses random\
    \ walk but also makes use of Levy’s §ight to search for the optimal solution;\n\
    this makes it a suitable candidate for optimizing the problem within the local\
    \ (using random walk) as well\nas global (using Levy’s §ight) search space. When\
    \ we are optimizing the solution in the global space; the\nprobability of ¦nding\
    \ the better optimal solution is increased as compared to the approaches that\
    \ utilize\nonly local search space (random walk theory) which eventually has no\
    \ global convergence. While the\nproblem of searching the optimal solution can\
    \ be solved by using CS algorithm; the optimality of the\nsolution needs to be\
    \ computed ¦rst which is derived from its ¦tness value. This ¦tness value is calculated\n\
    in the proposed protocol using Multi objective ACO approach. As per algorithm,\
    \ ants, while searching for\nthe food in the search space, leave behind the trail\
    \ of larva over the paths explored which is referred to as\npheromone. The pheromone\
    \ usually evaporates over a period of time and the longer paths trailed by the\n\
    ants encounter the complete or higher evaporation of the pheromones which makes\
    \ them unsuitable\nsolutions. The paths having higher value of pheromone over\
    \ them are usually more optimal ones.\nWhen we talk about hybridization of the\
    \ CS with ACO, we are hybridizing two things:\nthe searching behavior of cuckoo\
    \ in the local/global space and\nComputation of optimal/¦tness value for the solutions\
    \ using ants’ behavior.\nIn other words, whenever a cuckoo bird has moved from\
    \ one solution/nest to another solution/nest in the\nsearch space, the solution/nest\
    \ having better ¦tness value will be selected; the ¦tness of the solutions will\n\
    be computed with reference from the behavior of the ants which select the optimal\
    \ solution by computing\nprobability which in turn is dependent on pheromone value.\
    \ Thus, the hybrid protocol essentially uses the\nsearching behavior of cuckoo\
    \ bird to ¦nd the optimal solutions and the evaluation of optimality is done\n\
    using ant’s behavior. The proposed protocol is now discussed in detail below:\n\
    In this proposed protocol, each node will act as a nest for the cuckoo bird where\
    \ it can lay its egg. The\nselection of the optimal nest will be equivalent to\
    \ the selection of the optimal node which is ready to take\nover the role for\
    \ cluster head. Initially, the cuckoo bird is, considered to be present at a nest\
    \ or at any\nrandom node, analyzing its quality. The decision whether the present\
    \ nest is the optimal solution to lay\nand hatch its eggs will depend on the ¦tness\
    \ of the present as well as other nests, i.e. other nodes in the\nnetwork. The\
    \ exploration of the other nests, however, is done over the local search space\
    \ (the\ncommunication radius of any particular node) using random walk as well\
    \ as over global search space i.e.\nentire network in our case, via the use of\
    \ Levy’s §ight. Let us suppose that the ¦tness of the initial solution\nis represented\
    \ by \0; when the cuckoo has moved to some other solution, assume that its ¦tness\
    \ is\n.\nNow as per algorithm, if ¦tness of new solution is better than previous\
    \ one, i.e.\n, then latter\nsolution is considered as optimal solution. For the\
    \ computation of ¦tness value, the use of Multi\nObjective ACO has been done where\
    \ the probability of a selecting a node via pheromone value will\n\0 ∼\n\0 ∼>\
    \ \0Page 10/29\nrepresent the ¦tness value for the cuckoo search. In other words,\
    \ we can say that the probability\ncomputed using ACO will be the measure of ¦tness\
    \ value of the node. The broad steps to execute the\ncomplete protocol are:\n\
    1. Initialize the population\n2. Use multi objective ACO to compute probability\
    \ of every node\n3. Use the probability computed above as the input ¦tness value\
    \ for CS\n4. Migrate among the solutions using CS\n5. Select the optimal solution\
    \ as Cluster head\n5.1 Computation of Probability using Multi Objective ACO:\n\
    The use of ACO has been considered to achieve multiple objectives related to reducing\
    \ the energy\nconsumption of the system as well as minimizing the delay in transmitting\
    \ the information to base\nstation (because one of the application of the proposed\
    \ protocol is related to transmission of delay\nsensitive information i.e. environmental\
    \ factors causing ¦re incidents; it needs to be reported at minimal\ndelay at\
    \ the server so that prompt action can be taken well in advance). The multi objective\
    \ problem can\nbe formulated as:\n1\nWhere \nrepresents the multi objective function\
    \ which has to be minimized and is dependent on\nobjective function related to\
    \ energy consumption (\n) and related to delay in packet transmission (\n).\n\
    These two objective functions are discussed below in detail:\n5.1.1 Objective\
    \ function related to Minimizing the energy\nconsumption:\nThe energy usage of\
    \ a node in a WSN is related to various factors such as the set of neighbors of\
    \ a\nparticular node (as the communication with each one of them will attract\
    \ energy consumption), amount\nof data transmission (as the node which is sending\
    \ more data is likely to consume more energy),\nremaining energy of the node itself\
    \ etc. Therefore, we need to consider all these factors while designing\nthe objective\
    \ function related to minimization of energy consumption by a sensor. All the\
    \ factors being\nconsidered are discussed below in detail:\nRemaining energy of\
    \ the node: This factor has pretty much straight forward role to play in selection\n\
    of optimal node as cluster head; the node having higher amount of remaining energy\
    \ \n is likely to\nminimize (fnode) = (fen, fdl)\nfnode\nfen\nfdl\nEi\nPage 11/29\n\
    outperform the other nodes. Thus, it can be implied that the objective function\
    \ \nis directly\nproportional to residual energy of the node, mathematically we\
    \ can say that:\n2\nAmount of data transmission or Tra¨c heterogeneity among the\
    \ nodes: The current protocol is\nfocused at performing dual application for the\
    \ agriculture i.e. monitoring the soil moisture content\nand detecting the conditions\
    \ which may lead to ¦re incidents, with a sole motive of protecting the\ncrops.\
    \ This inherently necessitates the use of moisture sensor as well as temperature\
    \ and humidity\nsensor. As discussed above, the moisture sensor will be having\
    \ less data to transmit as compared to\nother two sensors (referred to as ¦re\
    \ sensors from hereon); the concept of tra¨c heterogeneity\ncomes into picture\
    \ with different amounts of data transmission from different kinds of sensors.\
    \ Let\nus assume that N are the total set of sensors deployed in the network to\
    \ monitor the environmental\nconditions where ω represents the set of ¦re sensors\
    \ and ϖ represent set of moisture sensors such\nthat \n. Further, assume that\
    \ Ъ and Ы represents the amount of tra¨c which will be\nforwarded by ¦re sensors\
    \ and moisture sensors in a single round respectively such that Ъ > Ы. Since\n\
    the energy expenditure is dependent on number of packets transmitted, this directly\
    \ implies that ¦re\nsensors will be consuming \n times more energy that moisture\
    \ sensors in forwarding their\ninherent tra¨c (inherent tra¨c implies the tra¨c\
    \ which is sensed by the sensor and not the tra¨c\nwhich is to be relayed for\
    \ some other sensor node). It, therefore, becomes evident that the current\nprotocol\
    \ must be designed in a way that moisture sensors should have more probability\
    \ of becoming\ncluster head as compared to other sensors (Since energy usage at\
    \ CH is more than that of cluster\nmember because they not only aggregate the\
    \ data but also relay the same to the base station). Thus,\nwe can conclude that\
    \ the objective function related to energy consumption is inversely proportional\n\

    \ of a particular type: As explained above, the CH has to aggregate the\ninformation\
    \ from the cluster members as well which attracts energy usage of the CH. A node\
    \ having\nhuge number of neighbors is likely to spend more energy in data aggregation;\
    \ furthermore, the\nproposed protocol talks about tra¨c heterogeneity which makes\
    \ it mandatory to consider the type of\nneighbor as well apart from just the total\
    \ number of neighbors of a particular node while optimizing\nit for head selection\
    \ process. Let us assume that in a system having a complete of ‘N’ nodes as well\n\
    as ‘k’ set of optimal clusters, the neighbor set for node ‘i’ could be described\
    \ as\nhaving a mix of\nboth type of sensors such that\n6\nWhere: \n are moisture\

    \ Objective function related to Minimizing the packet\ntransmission delay:\nAs\
    \ discussed earlier, delay is imperative metric to be considered for the proposed\
    \ agriculture application;\nthe objective function related to minimizing the transmission\
    \ delay is directly proportional to distance\nbetween the CH and the BS & size\
    \ of the cluster. More distance would mean more time to packets to\nreach the\
    \ base station; larger cluster size, on the other hand, will lead to larger data\
    \ aggregation time.\nBoth these factors are inversely related to the delay in\
    \ packet transmission. Mathematically, the objective\nfunction can be described\
    \ as:\n9\n10\nWhere \nrepresents the distance among the node & BS. To make the\
    \ equations compatible in context\nof measurement, the equations 9 and 10 can\
    \ be modi¦ed and combined as:\n11\nOnce, the multiple objectives for ACO has been\
    \ de¦ned, the next step is to compute the probability of the\nnodes which will\
    \ de¦ne their likelihood to be selected as the optimal solution such that above\
    \ de¦ned\nobjectives can be achieved. This probability the any ant ‘m’ travelling\

    \ ‘m’\nArea(i)signi¦es the communication scale of the node ‘i’\n are two heuristics\
    \ which are related to two objectives functions evaluated for the\nsuggested method;\
    \ these will be measured by equations 8 and 10 respectively. As far as pheromone\
    \ level\ndeposition is concerned, it will be computed as:\n13\nWhere \nis the\
    \ set of pheromone deposited at any node by the ant; σ (0 < σ <1) is the\nevaporation\
    \ coe¨cient which is taken as 0.4 in the suggested protocol. The initial level\
    \ of pheromone at\nall the nodes can be computed as:\n14\nWhere \nis constant\
    \ having value equals to 1. As the ants move from one node to another, the initial\n\
    pheromone levels are updated at each visiting node. Since, we are having two objective\
    \ functions,\ntherefore the pheromone levels at every node will be updated according\
    \ to respective objectives. In other\nwords, at any node, the pheromone levels\
    \ \nwill be updated according to the deviation of\nresidual energy of the node\
    \ with average remaining energy of the system as well as deviation of distance\n\
    of the node from the BS and average distance of the network from the base station.\

    N\nPage 15/29\nUntil this, the probability of the nodes to be elected as CH will\
    \ be computed. These probabilities serve as\ninput for the CS algorithm which\
    \ aims to explore all of them and come up with the most suitable solution.\nIn\
    \ other words, now for each node, we have respective probability in the search\
    \ space. The CS algorithm\ntakes these probabilities as ¦tness values for the\
    \ various solutions; explores them using random walk or\nlevy’s §ight and gives\
    \ the best node which will take over as the role for cluster head. The decision\
    \ as to\nwhether the search needs to be carried out using random or Levy’s walk\
    \ is determine by switching\nprobability. These walks can be mathematically represented\
    \ as:\n17\nWhere: \nare two randomly selected solutions in the local search space,\
    \ probably from within the\ncommunication range of the node, \n is the Heaviside\
    \ function which has value of 1 if the arguments are\npositive and has value of\
    \ 0 if the arguments are negative, \n represent the step size scaling\nfactor\
    \ & step size, switching probability and a random set in the scale of [0, 1].\
    \ Whilst on the other hand,\nthe Levy’s walk is carried out by following equation:\n\
    18\n19\nWhere: \nrepresents the Levy exponent. Therefore, if in the search space\
    \ the solution having ¦tness value\nas \0 is found either by using Eq. 16 or 17\
    \ and 18, it will be compared with ¦tness of existing solution and\nthe higher\
    \ one will serve as the optimal solution.\nOnce the cluster heads have been selected\
    \ in the entire network, they will form clusters with the\nneighboring nodes.\
    \ Another step in conserving the energy of the system is related to data transmission\n\
    from sensor nodes to CH and from CH to BS. At this step, normally the traditional\
    \ or most of the\nclustering protocols go for direct or single hop transmission\
    \ from head to server; however, in the proposed\nprotocol the ACO will be used\
    \ to form multiple paths from source CH to BS. The main aim is to choose`\nthe\
    \ shortest path to forward the information, therefore the Eq. 11 will get transformed\
    \ as per single\nobjective optimization problem & could be written down as:\n\
    xt+1\ni\n= xt\ni + αs ⊗ H(pa− ∈) ⊗ (xt\nj − xt\nk)\nxt\nj, xt\nk\nH\nα, s, pa,\
    \ ∈\nxt+1\ni\n= xt\ni + αL(s, ⋋)\nL(s, ⋋) =\n⋋\0 (⋋)sin (π\n⋋ )\n2\nπ\n1\ns1+⋋\n\
    ⋋\nPage 16/29\n20\nThe heuristic information for this step will be updated as\
    \ per the new objective function which can be\nde¦ned as:\n21\nWhere: \nrepresents\
    \ the distance among the current node & the next downlink node in the routing\n\
    path from source cluster head towards the base station that has assumable ‘q’\
    \ number of intermediate\nnodes. Correspondingly, the pheromone levels in the\
    \ Eq. 13 will be updated as per equation no 16.\nTherefore, the routing paths\
    \ will be formulated and among them, the path having highest probability will\n\
    be chosen where the data will be transferred to base station for the further use.\n\
    6. Results and Discussion\nThe suggested approach was computed in MATLAB where\
    \ the network was analyzed under two different\nscenarios. In one scenario, a\
    \ total of 100 nodes were deployed randomly with base station at 100,100,\nwhilst\
    \ in the other one, the number of sensors were 200 having base station at 200,200.The\
    \ number of\n¦re sensors, i.e. type of sensors having more data to send to destination\
    \ were taken as 30% of the total\nnodes; the remaining 70% were considered to\
    \ be moisture sensors. Furthermore, it was considered that\n¦re sensors have (1+\
    \ Ъ ) times more tra¨c to forward to base station where Ъ was assumed to be 0.5.\n\
    The computation variables used for simulating the network are given in Table 2.\
    \ The production of the\nsystem was analyzed in context of average remaining energy\
    \ of the system, network stability, system\nlifetime & delivery delay. Furthermore,\
    \ the suggested protocol was contrasted with other clustering\nschemes.\nprobm\n\

    \ The Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrates the variation of average energy\nremaining in\
    \ the system when BS was placed on different locations in the system with varying\
    \ set of\nnodes. This parameter shows how much energy is being absorbed by the\
    \ nodes while sending the\ninformation to other sensor in the network. Among all\
    \ the schemes, the CS-ACO had highest energy left\nwith the sensors which is possibly\
    \ explained by the fact that data transmission is optimized via routing\npaths\
    \ built using ACO. The multi hop communication among the nodes is more energy\
    \ e¨cient as\ncompared to direct transmission. This lessened energy consumption\
    \ in the network was further backed\nby the selection process of cluster heads\
    \ where the nodes having lesser inherent data were given more\npriority to become\
    \ leaders. As a result, network had approx. 39% more energy remaining with the\
    \ nodes\nas compared to GWO and 146% as compared to ESO.\nb) Network Stability:\
    \ This parameter has been computed in means of set of nodes which ran out of their\n\
    batteries completely and got dead. The values obtained has been shown in Figs. 3\
    \ and 4 where it is\nevident that CS-ACO had more network stability as compared\
    \ to other protocols. This means that load on\nthe nodes, which are taking over\
    \ the part of CH & then cluster members in the successive rounds, has\nbeen better\
    \ distributed. Since CH selection process considers the type of nodes in the neighborhood\
    \ as\nwell, the cluster formed is energy e¨cient in nature. This results in lesser\
    \ energy consumption and leads\nto better network stability. The CS-ACO had 21%\
    \ and 107% more network stability as compared to GWO\nEelec\nEfs\nEamp\nEda\n\
    Page 18/29\nwhen the base station was positioned at 100,100 with 100 nodes and\
    \ 200,200 with 200 nodes\nrespectively.\nc) Network Lifetime: This is another\
    \ parameter which is considered while analyzing network’s\nperformance. As re§ected\
    \ in previous two parameters which showed that network had consumed lesser\nenergy\
    \ and had more network stability; network lifetime was also in synch with readings\
    \ of former two\nparameters. The ¦rst node got dead in the network quite late\
    \ in CS-ACO as contrasted to other\napproaches and furthermore at the end of simulation,\
    \ the system had more number of alive nodes with\nproposed protocol. This assures\
    \ that CS-ACO had achieved one of the main objective of minimizing the\nenergy\
    \ usage of the network. This is purely attributed to better CH selection by examining\
    \ the tra¨c\nheterogeneity among the nodes & also taking care of nodes in the\
    \ neighborhood.\nd) Delivery Delay: This parameter holds high importance in the\
    \ scenario especially where the ¦re related\nmonitoring is involved. The Figs. 7\
    \ and 8 shows the values of delay obtained under different simulation\nscenarios.\
    \ It was observed that CS-ACO had approx. 33%, 39%, 44.6% and 50% lesser delay\
    \ in contrasted\nto GWO, ESO, GECR & LEACH respectively. This reason is because\
    \ the CH passes the information to the\nBS via the paths optimized using ACO.\
    \ These better paths resulted in lesser delay in transmitting the\ninformation\
    \ to the end server. This also approves the achievement of objective function\
    \ related to\nminimizing the delay of the network.\n7. Conclusion\nIoT plays an\
    \ important role in agriculture and this paper suggests a clustering approach\
    \ for agricultural\napplications. The proposed protocol uses hybrid cuckoo search\
    \ & ACO for the better selection of cluster\nheads in the system and optimizes\
    \ the data transmission process from cluster head to BS using multi\nhop communication\
    \ where the paths have been optimized again using ACO. The protocol was designed\n\
    to achieve better network lifetime and lessened delay in delivering the information\
    \ to the BS. The network\nwas analyzed based on average remaining energy of the\
    \ network, network stability, system lifetime &\ndelivery delay. Furthermore,\
    \ the suggested protocol was contrasted with other clustering schemes where it\n\
    showed better balanced energy consumption leading to enhanced network stability\
    \ as well as network\nlifetime. Also, the energy usage was lessened & information\
    \ reached base station earlier as compared to\nother protocols; this was very\
    \ important to achieve as the proposed protocol has been put forward\nkeeping\
    \ in view the application related to agricultural ¦res. The better cluster head\
    \ selection and data\ntransmission has been successfully re§ected in performance\
    \ parameters which concludes better network\nperformance. However, this protocol\
    \ provides a simulation scenario for agricultural applications which\ncan be realized\
    \ in real time in future work as well.\nDeclarations\nFunding: The authors declare\

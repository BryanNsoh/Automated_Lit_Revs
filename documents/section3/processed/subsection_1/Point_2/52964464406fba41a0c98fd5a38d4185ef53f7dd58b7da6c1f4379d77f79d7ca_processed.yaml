    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of

    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground
    cable system monitoring Wireless automatic meter reading (smart metering) Power
    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave
    Bacnet X10 EnOcean Insteon Without patents 228000 9790 5770 6700 1840 1520 720
    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave
    and Insteon. Empty Cell ZigBee Z-Wave Insteon Media wireless (radio) wireless

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    Metrics Abstract: Emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) require
    latency-aware computation for real-time application processing. In IoT environments,
    connected things generate a huge amount of data, which are generally referred
    to as big data. Data generated from IoT devices are generally processed in a cloud
    infrastructure because of the on-demand services and scalability features of the
    cloud computing paradigm. However, processing IoT application requests on the
    cloud exclusively is not an efficient solution for some IoT applications, especially
    time-sensitive ones. To address this issue, Fog computing, which resides in between
    cloud and IoT devices, was proposed. In general, in the Fog computing environment,
    IoT devices are connected to Fog devices. These Fog devices are located in close
    proximity to users and are responsible for intermediate computation and storage.
    One of the key challenges in running IoT applications in a Fog computing environment
    are resource allocation and task scheduling. Fog computing research is still in
    its infancy, and taxonomy-based investigation into the requirements of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications mapped to current research is still required. This
    survey will help the industry and research community synthesize and identify the
    requirements for Fog computing. This paper starts with an overview of Fog computing
    in which the definition of Fog computing, research trends, and the technical differences
    between Fog and cloud are reviewed. Then, we investigate numerous proposed Fog
    computing architectures and describe the components of these architectures in
    detail. From this, the role of each component will be defined, which will help
    in the deployment of Fog computing. Next, a taxonomy of Fog computing is proposed
    by considering the requirements of the Fog computing paradigm. We also discuss
    existing research works and gaps in resource allocation and scheduling, fault
    tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microser... (Show More) Taxonomy of

    Individuals and organizations are increasingly becoming dependent on computers
    and smart devices to deal with daily tasks. These devices are generating data
    via various sensors and applications. As a result, organizations are generating
    and storing huge amounts of data on a regular basis [1]. After the proliferation
    of IoT, data generated by sensors has increased enormously. With this sudden increase
    in the volume of data being produced and inability of conventional databases to
    process various forms of structured and unstructured data, big data analytics
    has attained great attention in recent years. Every organization is now prioritizing
    the analysis of collected data to extract useful insights in order to make important
    decisions [2]. Nowadays, organizations need a dynamic IT infrastructure because
    of the shift to cloud computing due to its accessibility, scalability, and pay-per-use
    features. The most common services provided by the cloud are known as Software
    as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service
    (IaaS), all of which are heading towards Anything as a Service (XaaS) [3]. However,
    data generated from billions of sensors, referred to as big data, cannot be transferred
    and processed in the cloud. In addition, some IoT applications need to be processed
    faster than the cloud’s current capability. This problem can be solved by using
    the Fog computing paradigm, which harnesses the processing power of devices located
    near users (idle computing power) to support utilization of storage, processing,
    and networking at the edge [4]. Fog computing is a decentralized computing concept,
    which does not exclusively rely on any central component like cloud computing
    [5], [6]. It is able to overcome the high latency problem of the cloud by using
    idle resources of various devices near users. However, Fog computing relies on
    the cloud to do complex processing. Unlike cloud computing, Fog computing is a
    decentralized computing concept, where the many devices around us, which have
    computation capacity, are utilized. Currently, even a low- specification smartphone
    has processing capacity, sometimes with multiple cores. Hence, many devices like
    smartphones, switches, routers, base stations, and other network management devices
    equipped with processing power and storage capacity can act as Fog devices. The
    resources of these devices are idle outside of peak hours. Many research issues
    relating to Fog computing are emerging due to its ubiquitous connectivity and
    heterogeneous organization. In the Fog computing paradigm, key issues are the
    requirements and the deployment of Fog computing environment. This is because
    the devices that exist in Fog environments are heterogeneous: therefore, the question
    that arises is how will Fog computing tackle the new challenges of resource management
    and failure handling in such a heterogeneous environment? Hence, it is necessary
    to investigate the very basic requirements for all other related aspects such
    as deployment issues, simulations, resource management, fault tolerance, and services.
    Several reviews [5], [7]–[12] have been done on Fog computing. Here, we present
    the focus and survey domains of these review works in brief. Similar concepts
    of Fog computing, definitions, application scenarios, and numerous issues are
    described by one study [7]. Hu et al. [8] presented the hierarchical architecture
    of Fog computing and technologies like computing, communication, and storage technologies,
    namely resource management, security, and privacy protection that support Fog
    deployment and application. Baccarelli et al. [9] surveyed Fog computing and the
    Internet of Everything (IoE) with an integrated point of view of Fog computing
    and IoE. Varshney and Simmhan [10] reviewed various dimensions of application
    characteristics, system architecture, and platform abstractions of edge, Fog,
    and cloud ecosystems. Perera et al. [11] reviewed the Fog computing domain from
    the platform perspectives of developers and end users towards building a sustainable
    sensing infrastructure for smart city applications. Mahmud et al. [5] presented
    a taxonomy of Fog computing according to the identified challenges and its key
    features. The proposed taxonomy provides a classification of the existing works
    in Fog computing. Mouradian et al. [12] reviewed Fog architecture and algorithms
    based on six different evaluation criteria, namely heterogeneity, QoS management,
    scalability, mobility, federation, and interoperability. However, none of the
    studies had investigated taxonomy based on the requirements of infrastructure,
    platform, and application in Fog computing. Moreover, none of them comprehensively
    investigated fault tolerance, resource management, or microservices in Fog computing.
    We consider the aforementioned current issues and discuss these extensively and
    also highlight how cloud computing-related solutions could be employed in the
    Fog in some cases. The contributions of this review work can be summarized as
    follows: Present the research trends in Fog computing by investigating the number
    of published research works and search occurrences in Google Scholar. Review of
    several Fog computing architectures and presentation of a detailed architecture,
    as most of the previous researchers only presented high-level architecture. Present
    a taxonomy by considering the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and application
    in the Fog computing paradigm. Identify Fog computing research gaps in resource
    allocation and scheduling, fault tolerance, simulation tools, and Fog-based microservices.
    Address the limitations of current research works and some open issues in infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. From this survey, the industry and research community
    will be able to gain insight into the requirements for building a Fog computing
    environment with a better understanding of resource management in the Fog. The
    remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II surveys definitions
    and research trends in Fog computing. A technical comparison between Fog and cloud
    paradigms presents in section III. Section IV discusses computing paradigms similar
    to Fog computing. Section V presents related works on Fog computing architecture
    and discusses the components of the Fog computing architecture. Section VI shows
    the taxonomy of Fog computing by reviewing its requirements. Section VII presents
    various application dimension of Fog computing. Section VIII discusses current
    state-of-the-art Fog computing technology. Section IX presents open issues and
    future research direction. Section X concludes the paper. SECTION II. Overview
    of Fog Computing The term ‘Fog computing’ was proposed in 2012 by researchers
    from Cisco Systems [13]. Processing application logic and data at the edge is
    not a new concept. The concept of Edge computation emerged around the 2000s [14],
    [15] and another similar concept, cloudlets, was introduced in 2009 [16]. Both
    Cloudlets and Fog computing are the advancements of a similar concept, which revolves
    around processing at the edge level. While cloudlets are applied in the mobile
    network, Fog computing is applied to connected things such as IoT, which plays
    into the concept of IoT [17]. Fog is both a virtualized and non-virtualized computing
    paradigm that provides networking, storage, and computation services amid cloud
    servers and IoT devices [4], [13]. However, these services are not completely
    located at the network edge. The Fog is a distributed computing approach that
    mainly focuses on facilitating applications, which require low latency services
    [18], Fog computing also supports non-latency aware services. It is obvious that
    using idle computation resources near the users will improve overall service performance,
    if the volume of processing were not that high. A huge number of heterogeneous
    nodes will be connected to the Fog. These nodes include sensors and actuators
    among others [13]. Computation is performed in Fog devices when necessary and
    storage facilities are also available for a short period of time, at least in
    most Fog devices. Time-sensitive computation in the Fog is done without the involvement
    of third parties, and in most cases, is done by the Fog processing devices. According
    to Yi et al. [7], the Fog computing paradigm supports the running of new services
    or basic network functions and applications in a sandboxed environment similar
    to cloudlets. However, the subject is still a research challenge because the question
    of how the Fog will provide these service still remains. In addition, will the
    Fog have cloud service providers or will it be like a single entity as a whole?
    Figure 1 shows a basic model of Fog Computing. Fog devices, Fog servers, and gateways
    are the basic computation components in the Fog environment. Any device that has
    computation, networking, and storage capabilities can act as a Fog device. These
    devices include set-top boxes, switches, routers, base stations, proxy servers
    or any other computing device. Fog servers that manage several Fog devices and
    Fog gateways are responsible for translation services between heterogeneous devices
    in the Fog computing environment. Fog gateways also provide translation services
    between IoT, Fog, and cloud layers. New challenges in this emerging computing
    paradigm have emerged in the past couple of years. FIGURE 1. A model of Fog computing.
    Show All In this section, we discuss the various definitions of Fog computing
    and define Fog computing from our point of view. In addition, we discuss and analyze
    research trends in Fog computing. Finally, we compare the technical differences
    between Fog computing and cloud computing. A. Definition of Fog Computing Fog
    computing is a distributed computing paradigm where processing is done at the
    edge of the network with seamless integration of the cloud infrastructure. It
    enables a computing facility for IoT environments or other latency sensitive application
    environments. It is estimated that about 50 billion “things” will be connected
    to the Internet by 2020 [19]. Transferring all data from all connected devices
    for processing on the cloud will need massive amounts of bandwidth and storage.
    All devices are not connected to the controller via IP but connected by some other
    IoT industrial protocols. Because of this, a translation process is also needed
    for the processing or storing of information from IoT devices. Various researchers
    have defined Fog computing in different ways. Some examples are as follows: “Fog
    computing is a highly virtualized platform that provides compute, storage, and
    networking services between IoT devices and traditional cloud computing data centers,
    typically, but not exclusively located at the edge of network.” [13] “Fog computing
    is a scenario where a huge number of heterogeneous (wireless and sometimes autonomous)
    ubiquitous and decentralised devices communicate and potentially cooperate among
    them and with the network to perform storage and processing tasks without the
    intervention of third parties. These tasks can be for supporting basic network
    functions or new services and applications that run in a sandboxed environment.
    Users leasing part of their devices to host these services get incentives for
    doing so.” [20] “The term Fog computing or Edge Computing means that rather than
    hosting and working from a centralized cloud, Fog systems operate on network ends.
    It is a term for placing some processes and resources at the edge of the cloud,
    instead of establishing channels for cloud storage and utilization.” [21] The
    first definition of Fog computing was presented by Bonomi et al. [13], where they
    addressed the computing paradigm as a highly virtualized platform. However, some
    IoT devices such as smartphones are not virtualized but could also be a part of
    the Fog infrastructure, as some processing could still be done. According to Cisco
    [22], the Fog computing paradigm provides an ideal place to analyze most data
    near the devices that produce and act on that data instantaneously. The Fog is
    located near things that are able to process and act on the data generated. The
    devices that are within the Fog environment are known as Fog devices. These nodes
    can be deployed at any place with a connectivity to the network: on the power
    pole, on the factory floor, alongside the road, alongside the railway line, in
    a vehicle, inside a shopping mall, on an oil rig, etc. A device that has processing,
    storage, memory, and network capability can act as a Fog device. Although the
    Fog extends the cloud, technically it resides in between the cloud and IoT devices
    and handles processing and storage tasks in close proximity to the user. Yi et
    al. [7] stated that the definition given by Vaquero and Rodero-Merino [20] is
    debatable and a definition that can distinguish clearly between Fog computing
    and other related computing paradigms is still required. The definition given
    by IBM [21] represents Edge and Fog computing as the same computing paradigm.
    According to Shi et al. [23], Fog computing focuses more on the infrastructure
    side while edge computing focuses more on the things’ side. Furthermore, Edge
    computing is not spontaneously associated with any cloud-based services such as
    SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS [5]. In brief, Table 1 summarizes Fog definitions provided
    by various research works. TABLE 1 Summary of Fog Computing Definitions Considering
    the above definitions, we define Fog computing as follows: Fog computing is a
    distributed computing platform where most of the processing will be done by virtualized
    and non-virtualized end or edge devices. It is also associated with the cloud
    for non-latency-aware processing and long-term storage of useful data by residing
    in between users and the cloud. In our definition, we considered all devices with
    computing and storage capacity as Fog devices and also more precisely identified
    the role of the cloud in the Fog computing environment. B. Fog Computing Research
    Trends Growing attention towards processing data closer to the users has been
    observed among industries and the academia in the past few years. Handling IoT-generated
    data at the edge level will help improve overall processing time. In this section,
    we investigate Fog and other related technological trends for the past few years
    in the research community. According to the Gartner hype cycle, in July 2017 [24],
    the peak emerging technology is the smart home, which would perform better with
    the incorporation of the Fog computing environment. A Hype Cycle [24] represents
    common patterns of new trending technologies. Fog computing can also enable latency-aware
    smart home services in a more efficient and convenient way, especially for emergency
    response smart home applications. According to the Gartner hype cycle demonstration,
    some other influencing technologies include virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles,
    IoT platforms, smart robots, edge computing, and smart workspaces, which are required
    to support latency-aware applications. All these mentioned technologies could
    benefit from the support of the Fog computing paradigm due to latency sensitiveness,
    connectivity to the cloud, and edge-level data processing capability. Except for
    the autonomous vehicle technology, all other aforementioned technologies will
    reach the market adoption threshold in the next 10 years. Besides the hype cycle
    analysis, we analyzed the search occurrence of Fog and other related technologies
    in Google Scholar. In addition, the number of papers available in different digital
    libraries related to the Fog was also analyzed. Google Scholar search occurrences
    of various similar technologies to Fog were investigated in the past few years,
    as presented in Figure 2. According to the data, edge computing is the topmost
    searched item in Google Scholar compared to other similar technologies. However,
    the search trend decreased by more than three times in the past eight years for
    edge computing. Mobile cloud computing and mobile edge computing are the other
    two top-searched computing paradigm after edge computing. The lowest trend observed
    was for dew computing and Fog dew computing. While the trend for edge computing
    is decreasing, Fog computing related to scholarly searches is increasing year
    by year, and has increased by 2.5 times from 2010 to 2017. This shows that Fog
    computing is the fastest growing research area in academia and will have a great
    impact on the industry as well. FIGURE 2. Search occurrence of similar technologies
    like the Fog in Google Scholar. Show All Fog computing topic search in the Web
    of Science shows that the number of scholarly articles has more than doubled between
    2015 and 2016, as per Figure 3. The first paper with ‘Fog computing’ in its title
    was published in 2012. Since then, about 564 journal and conference articles have
    been published on this topic in the four major digital libraries (Web of Science,
    Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, and ACM), as presented in Figure 4. Cloud computing
    first emerged in 2008 [25]. This shows that Fog computing publications have dramatically
    increased, as no study in this area was seen in the couple of years following
    the introduction of cloud computing research in 2008 (see Figure 5). FIGURE 3.
    No. of Fog computing-related papers in the Web of Science (as Feb 2018). Show
    All FIGURE 4. Number of publications with ”Fog computing” in the title in the
    four major digital libraries. Show All FIGURE 5. Published articles with the title
    cloud computing in the Web of Science. Show All From our observation, it is obvious
    that the interest in Fog computing research is rapidly increasing. Idle resources
    in the form of devices near users can be utilized within the Fog computing concept.
    Thus, a clear direction to market the adoption and technological development of
    Fog deployment has emerged. SECTION III. Difference Between Fog and Cloud Computing
    Paradigm Fog computing architectures are based on Fog clusters where multiple
    Fog devices participate to cooperate with the processing. On the other hand, datacenters
    are the main physical components of clouds. Because of this, cloud computing has
    high operational costs and energy consumption. By comparison, energy consumption
    and operation costs in the Fog computing paradigm is low. The Fog is located closer
    to the user, so the distance between users and Fog devices could be one or a few
    hops, which is also agreed by Hu et al. [8]. However, according to Mahmud et al.
    [26], the distance between users to the Fog is one or two hops. Again, Luan et
    al. [27] argued that the distance should be one hop with wireless connectivity.
    Yet, all agreed with the distance between the users to the cloud, which is a multi-hop
    distance. Due to the distance, communication latency for the cloud is always high
    compared to the Fog. The cloud is a more centralized approach while the Fog is
    a more distributed approach based on geographical orchestration [26]. Real-time
    Interaction is not possible for the cloud due to its high latency, but this problem
    can be easily resolved by Fog computing. On the other hand, the rate of failure
    in the Fog is high because of wireless connectivity, decentralized management,
    and power failure [26], [28]–[30]. Most devices in Fog environments will be connected
    wirelessly since smart gadgets and handheld devices will be participating in Fog
    systems [31]. These devices, and other network management devices, are mostly
    decentralized. These devices could fail when software is not managed correctly.
    Users may not be aware of malicious software that could lead to device failure.
    Moreover, Fog processing could fail in other cases as well, for example, each
    Fog device is responsible for performing its own application processing. So, the
    IoT application processing in a Fog device always takes second priority. If the
    Fog device is fully utilized by the application of the device itself, then it
    will fail to do any Fog processing. Hence, the scheduling of applications and
    resources in the Fog is more complex. In addition, failure handling in the Fog
    is competitive because of power failure, which is only an issue because the devices
    run on battery power. Altogether, Table 2 shows the technical differences between
    the cloud and the Fog. TABLE 2 Technical Difference Between Fog and Cloud Definitely,
    it cannot be said that the Fog can replace the cloud. We cannot even conclude
    that the Fog is better than the cloud either, both contribute differently via
    fulfilling different perspectives and requirements. SECTION IV. Related Paradigms
    and Technologies Fog computing uses computing resources near underlying networks,
    located between the traditional cloud and edge devices, to provide better and
    faster application processing and services [13]. Several similar computing paradigms
    exist besides Fog computing such as Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile-Edge
    Computing (MEC), Edge Computing, Dew Computing, and Fog-dew computing. In cloud
    computing, all IoT devices are directly connected to the cloud and computation
    totally depends on the cloud. However, all the above similar technologies do not
    exclusively depend on the cloud, but depend on some intermediate devices for computation;
    some of them do not even require a connection to the cloud. Figure 6 shows the
    high-level architecture of these technologies. FIGURE 6. High level architecture
    of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Edge Computing (EC),
    Dew Computing (DC), Fog Computing (FC) and Fog Dew Computing (FDC). Show All A.
    Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) Remote execution of offloaded mobile services is
    done with the support of MCC near end users [32], [33]. MCC overcomes the computational,
    energy, and storage resource limitation of smart mobile devices. Generally, a
    lightweight cloud server (cloudlet) is placed at the edge of the network [34]
    to overcome these issues. MCC is a mobile computing technology, which provides
    unrestricted functionality, mobility, and storage facility through heterogeneous
    network connectivity. This technology also provides unified elastic computing
    resources by following the pay-per-use model. It also provides access to data,
    application, and cloud via the Internet for mobile users. It is expected that
    this technology will be applied in education, urban and rural development, healthcare,
    and more realistic social networking in the future [32]. Nowadays, many computation-intensive
    applications are widely available, such as Augmented Reality, computer vision
    and graphics, speech recognition, machine learning, planning and decision-making,
    and natural language processing applications. However, simply designing powerful
    mobile devices will not meet the requirements for these applications [33]. Rather,
    the applications require edge processing as well as collaboration with the cloud
    for complex processing. Thus, mobile computing demands fundamental changes to
    cloud computing, for example, a low-latency middle tier, programming models to
    enable seamless remote execution, basic mobile cloud services such as presence
    services, cloud infrastructure optimization for mobile applications, memcache
    services, and so on [33]. The convergence of mobile cloud computing is predicated
    on a reliable, end-to-end network, and high bandwidth, which isdifficult to guarantee
    in harsh environments. One of the solutions to this deep-rooted problem is the
    VM-based cloudlets located at a closer location to the mobile device [34]. B.
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) MEC proposes the co-location of computing and storage
    resources at the base stations of cellular networks [35]. MEC could either be
    connected or disconnected to cloud datacenters in a remote location. Hence, MEC
    supports two- or three-tier hierarchical application deployments along with end
    mobile devices [36]. In a MEC ecosystem, a new device called the MEC server needs
    to be deployed near base station towers to provide processing and storage capabilities
    at the edge. Four participants are involved in this computing paradigm, which
    are the mobile end users, network operators, Internet infrastructure provider
    (InPs),and application service provider. Mobile end users are the main consumer
    of the system and request their service via user equipment (UE). Network operators
    manage and maintain the operation of base stations, mobile core network, and MEC
    servers. InPs maintain Internet connectivity and routers. Application service
    providers host the application services in the content delivery networks (CDN)
    or within a data centers. Processing of requests from the UE will search out the
    closest MEC. The MEC server is capable of processing user request instead of forwarding
    it to remote Internet services. In a case where it is not possible to process
    or complete a request at the MEC sever; the request will be forwarded to remote
    CDNs or data centers [35]. According to Klas [36], MEC is the evolution of mobile
    base stations. It is a natural development. It is a collaborative deployment of
    telecommunication and IT networking. This computing paradigm enables new vertical
    business segments and services to individual end users and enterprise consumers.
    Various services could be delivered through this computing paradigm including
    IoT, location services, augmented reality, caching service, video analytics, and
    local content distribution. It can deliver real-time low-latency access of local
    content or by caching content at the MEC server. However, the main limitation
    of this system is the installation of the MEC server, which is specifically dedicated
    to MEC services. Scaling is another big issue with the increase in resource demand
    over time. C. Edge Computing Edge devices or edge servers provide computation
    facilities in Edge computing. In general, edge computing does not spontaneously
    associate with any types of cloud-based services and concentrates more on the
    IoT device side [23]. One study defined the edge as any network or computing resource
    near the path between cloud data centers and data sources [23]. Any smart device
    or sensor could have data sources but the edge is different. For example, a cloudlet
    and a micro datacenter is the edge of the mobile application and cloud, whereas
    the IoT gateway is the edge between IoT sensors and cloud. Similarly, if a cloud
    application is running on a smartphone, then the smartphone is the edge of the
    application and the cloud [37]. The main motivation of edge computing is that
    the computation should be done at a closer location to the data sources. In the
    edge computing concept, things are not only consuming data but also produce data
    by taking part in processing. Edge devices can perform computation task from the
    cloud besides requesting services and content. Data storage, computing offloading,
    processing, and caching will be done by an edge node. The edge device is also
    capable of distributing requests and providing service on behalf of the cloud
    to the users. In such scenarios, edge devices need to be well designed to meet
    privacy requirements, reliability measures, and security concerns [23]. D. Dew
    Computing (DC) In the current computing hierarchy, Dew Computing [38] is situated
    at the ground level of the cloud and Fog computing environment [39]. DC goes beyond
    the concept of service, storage, and network, to a sub-platform, which is based
    on a microservice concept for which its computing hierarchy is vertically distributed
    [39]. The DC approach facilitates resources such as sensors, tablets, and smartphones
    that are seamlessly connected to a network. Because of this, DC covers a wide
    range of ad-hoc-based networking technologies [39]. Skala et al. [39] argued that
    DC is much more useful in everyday life compared to Fog computing. Fog supports
    IoT-based applications, which demand less latency and real-time capability and
    a dynamic network configuration while DC is microservice concept and thus is not
    dependent on any centralized device, server, or cloud. They provide an example
    in which DC could be integrated into a smart traffic control system, where data
    collection and processing units will be located in between the traffic signals.
    These units generate a collective overview of the current traffic conditions.
    In such a way, a car with low fuel will be notified before entering heavy congestion,
    or a hybrid car will be informed of switching to conventional fuel before approaching
    the congestion. As a result, cars with less fuel will be rescued from unwanted
    situations and hybrid cars could reduce exhaust smoke densities significantly.
    Although the concept is microservice-based, the processing is completed in Fog
    devices. In the Fog computing concept, it is not crucial that applications must
    be dependent on the cloud or require the storing of results in the cloud. On the
    other hand, if such traffic processing information were stored, it would help
    strategic decision-making to improve traffic management. Dew computing is an emerging
    research area and its goal is to use the full potential of cloud and local resources
    [40]. E. Fog-Dew Computing In the architecture of Fog-dew computing, IoT devices
    need not have an active Internet connection while being connected to the community
    server. The community server will interact with the cloud and is responsible for
    providing services to the IoT devices [41]. Cloud computing always needs an Internet
    connection, which is the main drawback of the cloud. While the cloud is unable
    to serve users without an Internet connection, Fog-dew computing facilitates offline
    services without an Internet connection. However, there are some exceptions. For
    example, the navigation app, Waze, allows users to navigate offline. This feature
    was also recently added to Google Maps. In this case, a map information file for
    a specific area is downloaded to the user device and allows users to navigate
    during an offline state. Another example is Google Drive and Dropbox, where users
    can delete, create, and update files and folders in offline mode and then sync
    once the device is connected to the Internet. However, these services are not
    purely offline-we may not rely on the Internet directly but we cannot completely
    ignore Internet connection. The situation becomes more complex when a single user
    uses multiple offline devices alongside the complexity that arises in a multiuser
    environment. Such situations could be mitigated with the help of Fog-dew computing.
    In summary, in the Fog computing paradigm, IoT devices are connected to the cloud
    via Fog devices. Fog devices are connected to the cloud through the core network.
    Fog computing is a combination of MEC and MCC [7] but the main goal of all Fog-related
    paradigms is to perform processing at the edge. These related paradigms differ
    from each other based on Internet and cloud connectivity. Also, the amount of
    processing that needs to be done at the edge differs based on service requirements.
    Furthermore, the type of devices that will be used for computation and storage
    purposes is also another issue. In summary, Table 3 shows the characteristics
    of the above-discussed related computing paradigms along with the Fog computing
    paradigm. TABLE 3 Summary of Similar Technologies Like Fog SECTION V. Architecture
    of Fog Computing For market adoption and deployment, Fog computing must have a
    standard architecture. There is no available standard architecture to date. However,
    many research works have presented Fog computing architectures. In this section,
    we firstly discuss the high-level architecture of Fog computing. Furthermore,
    we summarize some proposed architectures for Fog computing. Finally, we present
    a detailed architecture for Fog computing with a comprehensive description of
    each component of the architecture. A. High-Level Architecture of Fog Computing
    In high-level architecture, the Fog computing paradigm has three different layers,
    as shown in Figure 7. The most important layer is the Fog layer. This layer consists
    of all intermediate computing devices. Traditional virtualization technologies
    can be used at this plane, similar to the cloud. However, considering the resource
    availability, employing container-based virtualization is more appropriate. This
    layer accumulates sensor-generated data from the IoT layer and sends an actuation-related
    request after processing. Although it seems that the big data problem is solved
    by processing generated data at the edge level, billions of devices will create
    big data issue. In fact, it is possible to employ small- and medium-scale big
    data processing at this level. Many research works have been undertaken to process
    big data in the Fog plane [47]–[53]. FIGURE 7. High level Fog computing architecture.
    Show All The bottommost layer is the IoT plane, which consists of all connected
    devices. The devices on this plane perform the sensing and actuation process.
    For time-sensitive applications, processing should be done on the Fog plane exclusively
    while the cloud can perform other processing that is not time-sensitive. However,
    the Fog layer will manage what needs to be sent to the cloud and what should not.
    The users are able to get services from both the Fog and cloud based on their
    request. However, the cloud plane will manage complex processing and storage.
    B. Various Proposed Architectures for Fog Computing Layered representation is
    the best way to represent Fog architecture. Many works have been done to quantify
    the layer-based concept of Fog architecture [4], [27], [54]–[58]. From our review,
    we found that researchers have proposed three [27], [56]–[58], four [55], five
    [4], and six [54] layers in the Fog architecture. Everyone has their own justifications
    for their claims. If we ignored the user plane, it is obvious that Fog architecture
    could be defined as three different levels from the high level. As we proceed
    to the more implementation-type level, the number of layers in the architecture
    would vary, giving rise to five [4] and six [54] levels in the Fog computing layer.
    Aazam and Huh [54] presented six different layers based on specific tasks. On
    the other hand, Dastjerdi et al. [4] defined five different layers based on network
    perspective. Other high-level architectures in Fog computing were also presented
    by various researchers including the hierarchical Fog architecture [59], [60],
    OpenFog architecture [61], Fog network architecture [62], Fog architecture for
    Internet of energy [9], Fog computing Architecture based on nervous system [63],
    and IFCIoT architecture [64]. After reviewing the literature stated above, we
    define the components of Fog computing architecture, which is presented in the
    following subsection. C. Components of Fog Computing Architecture Fog computing
    architecture consists of several layers. Each layer and its components are shown
    in Figure 8. In this subsection, we discuss various components of the Fog computing
    architecture. The components are divided into several groups based on their functionality,
    which is defined as the layer. These functionalities will enable IoT devices to
    communicate with various Fog devices, servers, gateways, and the cloud. A detailed
    explanation of each layer is given below, where a smart transportation use case
    is considered in the explanation. FIGURE 8. Components of Fog computing architecture.
    Show All 1) Physical Layer The basic data source for Fog computing is the various
    forms of data emitted by the sensors [57]. These data could be generated from
    smart devices, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, smart homes, the CCTV surveillance
    system, traffic monitoring system, self-driving vehicles, and so on. For instance,
    if we wanted to implement a smart traffic management and monitoring system, we
    need to get updated traffic conditions of all roads from various sensors, roadside
    devices, and cameras, which will help manage traffic signals. It is also necessary
    to predict future traffic demand by collecting data from various GPS sensors.
    Besides physical sensors, the role of virtual sensors is also important [54],
    if a road accident occurred, it would not be possible to decide using just a single
    sensor whether the road should be blocked or traffic should keep going. The road
    might have one or more lanes- one lane may be affected by this occurrence while
    another lane could enable the traffic flow to continue, but the traffic handling
    capacity will be decreased due to this occurrence. In this case, a virtual sensor
    might help obtain an immediate decision on road conditions, traffic multiplexing,
    and traffic rerouting. Hence, the physical layer consists of physical and virtual
    sensors, where any data generation device could fall into any of these groups.
    2) Fog Device, Server, and Gateway Layer The Fog device, Fog server, or Fog gateway
    could be a standalone device or an IoT device [57], [59], [62]. However, it is
    obvious that the Fog server should have a higher configuration than the Fog device
    and gateway since it manages several Fog devices. Various factors are involved
    so that the Fog server can run. These include its role, hardware configuration,
    connectivity, number of devices it can manage, and so on. Whether the Fog server
    is distinct or part of an IoT device is defined by its role. A group of physical
    and virtual sensors will be connected to a Fog device. Similarly, a group of Fog
    devices will be connected to a Fog server. In this context, the Fog server should
    have higher processing and storage capacity compared to the Fog device. A specific
    cluster of Fog devices, which are connected to the same server, can communicate
    with each other when required. In the smart transportation use case, some application
    processing might depend on other Fog clusters. For example, if an application
    needed to find a fuel-efficient route, it might need information about other sensor
    clusters or Fog device clusters. To reach an appropriate decision, processing
    needs to be done in multiple Fog devices and servers. The Fog server and device
    layer are responsible for managing and maintaining information on hardware configuration,
    storage configuration, and connectivity of device and servers. This layer also
    manages the computation requirements requested by various applications. Computation
    requirements depend on data flow and the total number of IoT devices connected
    to the Fog device, as well as the total number of Fog devices connected to the
    Fog server. The communication between several Fog servers is maintained by this
    layer. For example, a Cisco IOx-supported 800 series router can be used as a Fog
    device and Cisco Fog data service devices can be used as the Fog server [65],
    [66]. 3) Monitoring Layer The monitoring layer always keeps track of the system
    performance and resources [54], services, and responses. System monitoring components
    help choose the appropriate resources during operation. Various applications run
    in smart transportation system scenarios. Therefore, it is obvious that a situation
    could arise when resource availability will be negative for computation or storage
    on a Fog device. A similar case could happen to the Fog server. To tackle these
    kinds of situations, the Fog device and servers will seek help from other peers.
    Thus, the system monitoring component will help decide such things efficiently.
    The resource demand component monitors current resource demand and can predict
    future demand for resources based on current resource usage and user activities.
    In this way, the system will be able to deal with any awkward situations where
    resource outage might occur. Performance prediction monitors can predict Fog computing
    performance based on system load and resource availability. This component is
    required to maintain appropriate QoS requirements in service level agreements.
    If SLA violation occurs frequently, then the cost of the system for the provider
    will be increased because of the penalty. Although performance prediction cannot
    eliminate this issue completely, it will be able to minimize overall SLA violation
    by predicting the performance and usage of the system. 4) Pre and Post-Processing
    Layer This layer contains multiple components, which specifically work on basic
    and advanced data analysis. At this level, acquired data are analyzed and filtered,
    and data trimming and reconstruction are also done when necessary. After processing
    the data, the data flow component decides whether the data needs to be stored
    locally or should be sent to the cloud for long-term storage [59]. The main challenge
    in Fog computing is to process data at the edge and minimize the volume of data
    that needs to be stored; this phenomenon is referred to as stream processing.
    In the smart transportation system use case, data will be generated from many
    sensors. These generated data will be analyzed and filtered in real time to get
    insight into the generated data. All generated data might not have any use. In
    some cases, it would not even be a good idea to store all generated data. As an
    example, if data is generated from a sensor each second, the mean value of data
    within a minute or within an hour may be stored depending on application requirements.
    Data can be trimmed in this way and a vast amount of storage space can be saved.
    In another case, if the difference among data values in some period of time is
    not that big, but might affect performance, then less numbers of reading within
    a minute can be taken. In such a way, it will be possible to filter a vast amount
    of generated data. Although the accuracy may not be 100%, application requirements
    might still be fulfilled to some extent. Data reconstruction is one of the components
    of this layer. This module takes care of faulty and incomplete data generated
    by the sensors. Similarly, if one or more sensors fail during operation, this
    component will reconstruct the data based on the data generation pattern to prevent
    interruption or any other application failure. 5) Storage Layer The storage module
    is responsible for storing data through storage virtualization. The data backup
    component ensures availability of data and mitigates the loss of data. In the
    storage virtualization concept, a pool of storage devices connected by a network
    acts as a single storage device, which is easier to manage and maintain. One of
    the key benefits of storage virtualization is to provide enterprise-class functionality
    using less-expensive storage or commodity hardware. Thus, the storage layer facilitates
    storage virtualization in order to minimize the complexity of the storage system.
    In a system, storage might fail at any point during system operation [67]. Therefore,
    it is crucial to backup important data to mitigate any unwanted situations. The
    data backup module in this layer takes care of periodic or customized data backup
    schemes. 6) Resource Management Layer The components in this layer maintain the
    allocation of resources, and scheduling, and deal with energy saving issues. The
    reliability component maintains the reliability of application scheduling and
    resource allocation. Scalability ensures the scalability of Fog resources during
    peak hours where resource demand is high. The cloud deals with horizontal scalability
    while Fog computing aims to provide both horizontal and vertical scalability [9].
    There are many distributed system resources for network, processing, and storage.
    This is a critical issue for distributed resources, which use application processing.
    Thus, resource allocation, deallocation, and reallocation will happen in which
    the resource allocation component manages and maintains resource allocation related
    issues. Another vital issue is that many applications will run in the Fog computing
    environment simultaneously. Hence, proper scheduling of these applications is
    required. The application scheduling component takes care of these applications
    based on various objectives. This layer also has energy saving components, which
    manage resources in an energy-efficient manner. Energy efficiency also positively
    affects the environment and helps minimize operational cost. Reliability components
    handle the requirement for the reliability of a system based on various reliability
    measures and metrics. Fog computing is a complex system that needs to take care
    of all IoT devices, Fog devices, and the cloud. Therefore, a device or connection
    might fail at any level, so reliability management is an important issue. 7) Security
    Layer All security-related issues such as encryption of communications and secure
    data storage will be maintained by the components in this layer, which also preserve
    the privacy of Fog users. Fog computing is intended to be deployed as a form of
    utility computing like cloud computing. However, in the cloud computing concept,
    the user connects to the cloud for services, but in the Fog computing concept
    the user will connect to the Fog infrastructure for the services while the Fog
    middleware will manage and maintain communications with the cloud. Hence, a user
    intending to connect to a service must be authorized by the provider. Therefore,
    the authentication component in the security layer processes authentication requests
    from users, so they can connect to the Fog computing service environment [27].
    To maintain security, it is crucial to maintain encryption between communications,
    so that security breaches by outsiders will not occur. The encryption component
    encrypts all connections from and to IoT devices and to the cloud. Fog computing
    components are mostly connected via a wireless connection, so security concerns
    are crucial. Some services in a smart city or smart house privacy are also an
    issue because of the involvement of user-related data in these types of systems.
    The Fog computing paradigm should not disclose user information without their
    consent. In the current age, the majority of users normally accept the security
    policy of the provider without reading it. Thus, special consideration of privacy
    should be undertaken for such services that involve user-related critical information.
    8) Application Layer Although the Fog was developed to serve IoT applications
    [58], several other applications based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and CDN
    also support Fog computing. Any application that has latency-aware characteristics
    will be able to take advantage of Fog computing. This includes any type of utility-based
    service that could fit within Fog computing by providing better service quality
    and cost-effectiveness. For example, Augmented Reality-based applications should
    adopt Fog computing because of its nature. It is clear that Augmented Reality
    will transform the modern world in the near future. The needs of real-time processing
    for Augmented Reality applications can be addressed by Fog computing, which can
    maintain continuous improvement of Augmented Reality-related services. SECTION
    VI. Taxonomy of Fog Computing The Fog computing taxonomy is presented in Figure
    9. This taxonomy is derived by considering existing literature and the overall
    viewpoint on Fog computing. The proposed taxonomy focuses on the requirements
    perspective for infrastructure, platform, and application. FIGURE 9. Taxonomy
    of Fog computing based on the requirements of infrastructure, platform, and applications.
    Show All Firstly, by considering infrastructure, we identify infrastructure and
    network requirements, and the types of devices in a Fog computing environment.
    Secondly, for platform resource allocation and scheduling, security and privacy
    concern, service requirements, management, and multitenancy were determined. Finally,
    we defined application requirements, user requirements, and application modeling
    taxonomy for Fog computing. This taxonomy will help the research community and
    enterprises to gain better understanding and insight into the real-world deployment
    of Fog computing requirements, architecture, and devices. Figure 9 shows the taxonomy
    of Fog computing. A detailed description of each branch of the taxonomy is presented
    in this section. A. Infrastructure Fog computing infrastructure requirements depend
    on the network, devices, and their requirements. All Fog devices, network devices,
    and gateways existing in the Fog environment that participates in computation
    are also part of the Fog infrastructure. Infrastructure denotes the physical components
    of the Fog environment. 1) Infrastructure Requirements The many connected tiny
    devices are the primary elements in a Fog computing environment. These devices
    are located everywhere and help to connect all things around us. It is estimated
    that the world will see 50 billion handheld devices by 2020. Beside these devices,
    a huge number of sensors and actuators will also be put in place. Therefore, a
    proper infrastructural facility is needed to support this vast computing environment
    [20]. An example of how the number of sensors is increasing day by day is given
    in The Economist report titled, “Augmented Business”, which describes the implant
    sensors on cattle ears that could help to monitor their activity, health, and
    movements. This could help increase overall productivity. The implant of sensors
    affixed in one cow produces about 200 MB of information in a year. In another
    example, with sensor technology, Rolls-Royce is able to forecast when engines
    will more likely fail. From such a prediction, customers can plan engine changes.
    Heidelberger Druckmaschinen has huge printing presses equipped with more than
    1,000 sensors. These are the examples of distinct uses of sensors in specific
    domains. However, this phenomenon will change completely when the distinct parts
    are connected to generate more efficient and effective decisions. Therefore, the
    Fog infrastructure must have the capability to provide physical resources for
    computation, networking, storage, and memory to achieve efficient Fog computing
    services. 2) Network Requirements The network is one of the key bottlenecks in
    the Fog computing environment, where billions of connected devices generate and
    consume data at the edge of the network [68]. Most of the sensing and actuating
    devices require low bandwidth but a higher number of devices will be connected
    at the same time. Therefore, existing network connection technologies like LAN,
    MAN, WAN, or PAN need to be investigated further and amendments will be needed
    to cope with the Fog computing environment to facilitate countless IoT devices.
    Network operators are increasingly investing in new wireless access technology
    research because of the number of devices per user is increasing day by day. For
    instance, in the cellular mobile network, base stations have a limited number
    of link points [20]. As the number of things increase, these stations will need
    to support increasing numbers of devices. Fog devices must act as a router for
    neighboring IoT devices and as a primary processing unit for IoT application in
    the Fog environment. Each Fog device should have a resilient connectivity to the
    lower and upper layer devices. Mobile ad-hoc networks could act as a basis for
    the Fog network because of their mobility and lower cost feature [20]. Hence,
    connection and mobility are the main requirements for the Fog network. 3) Fog
    Devices Fog computing is basically intended to support IoT-related technologies
    to perform processing at the edge level. Mine projects [69], [70] at the middle
    of the sea, airline fleets or a ship [70] can be equipped with a huge number of
    sensors, so it is impossible to send and store all generated data in real-time
    into the cloud. Some intermediate computation, processing, and services will be
    done by Fog computing devices. Thus, the Fog layer must have sensor management
    devices, Fog processing, and storage devices and Fog gateway devices. All of these
    devices will work collaboratively to manage and perform tasks in the Fog plane.
    Here, we discuss the devices that are needed for Fog computing deployment. a:
    IoT Devices IoT devices are the devices that have sensing and actuating capability.
    A sensor is able to sense the environment, while an actuator acts on it when necessary.
    One of the most common types of sensor in IoT devices is the temperature sensor.
    The temperature sensor has various functions depending on different domains such
    as at home, in factories, and in the agriculture field. This sensor is also used
    to sense the temperature of soil, water, and plants in order to take proper action
    needed to improve service outcome. Another type of useful sensor is the pressure
    sensor, used especially in agriculture, smart vehicles, and aircrafts. Sensors
    are also used to estimate the volume of water used by the agricultural sector
    for cultivation and other uses. Surprisingly, a huge percentage of this water
    is wasted due to leaky irrigation systems and inefficient use of fresh water.
    Efficient use of the pressure sensor will help solve this problem. The pressure
    sensor is able to determine the flow of water and reduce water waste. The pressure
    sensor is also used in smart vehicles to determine the forces acting on it, and
    in aircrafts to determine altitude. Different groups of sensors are used for different
    IoT environments. For example, in healthcare, the most-used sensors are chemical,
    IR, pressure, and temperature sensors as well as other biosensors. On the other
    hand, in a smartphone, the most-used sensors are the gyroscope, GPS, and proximity
    sensors. One of the applications of the proximity sensor is to determine the presence
    of ear to dim or turn off the phone backlight to improve battery efficiency. This
    sensor is also used to monitor parking space since it can determine the presence
    of an object without touching it. It can also be used in a wide temperature range
    and is not affected by color. Its detection process also is not effected by dirt,
    oil, or water. There are many other sensors out there that enable IoT, which include
    GPS sensors, water quality sensors, level sensors, chemical/gas sensors, smoke
    sensors, IR sensors, humidity sensors, sound and vibration sensors, motion sensors,
    acceleration sensors, and machine vision sensors. There are five main types of
    actuators-magnetic or thermal, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical.
    The actuator has a controlling or moving mechanism, a motor, which acts on various
    inputs. The raw application data comes from various sensors like speed sensors,
    cameras, temperature sensors, vehicle monitoring sensors, or GPS sensors. A typical
    sensor generates 10 data samples every second [71]. Sensors convert environmental
    variables such as smoke, heat, light, temperature, humidity, sound, and so on
    into electrical signals. These sensors are varied and can be micro-electro-mechanical
    systems (MEMS)-based, CMOS-based or LED sensors. Communication among sensors could
    be done by ZigBee, Bluetooth, Z-Wave or 6LoWPAN standards for short distance communication
    [72]. There is a necessity for communication among sensors in some cases where
    one sensing output is dependent on other collective sensor outputs. These sensors
    will be connected to Fog devices through wireless connections. However, Fog devices
    collect and process data based on application requirements. Some example of research
    works based on sensors can be improved by taking advantage of Fog computing. Aziz
    et al. [73] proposed a real-time health monitoring system using particular sensors
    in which the proposed architecture was based on GSM and GPS technologies. The
    system specifically monitors the body temperature and blood pressure of patients.
    The study used an Arduino microcontroller, dfrobot GPS/GPRS/GSM module v3.0.3,
    a heartbeat pulse sensor, and a lilypad temperature sensor for hardware implementation.
    In another study, a web-based application was developed for doctors and nurses
    with SMS functionality, which will be used as an emergency case. The system is
    able to generate GPS location, body temperature, and blood pressure. Butt et al.
    [74] investigated wearable technology such as SensHand, Gloves-based system, electromyography-based
    and hybrid systems, leap motion, and smartwatches. The development of these kinds
    of technology must be integrated with the smart home system and Fog-like architecture
    in order to deal with emergency situations. Some devices such as the smartphone
    can be considered as both an IoT and Fog device. In the same way, if some sensors
    and actuators were installed in the Raspberry Pi, the device could also act as
    both an IoT and Fog device. b: Fog Processing Devices Any device that has computing
    capability, storage, and network connectivity can act as a Fog processing device.
    It could be a network controller, switch, router, server, or a video surveillance
    camera. A Cisco 800 series router can be used as a Fog device where the IoT application
    can be run on the device and the device supporting Cisco IOx. To date, only Cisco
    800 series routers are supporting IOx with Linux kernel with virtualization support
    [44]. Most of these devices have a 266-400 MHz MPC8272 processor with 16 KB Cache,
    64 MB random access memory and 20 MB processor board flash memory. The user can
    host an application on these routers. These routers have two cores-Cisco IOS runs
    on one core and another core is used for running IOx services. Another type of
    Fog processing device is the Fog server. A Fog server can control several Fog
    devices in a specific domain. Cisco offers two flavors of Fog computing server
    deployment. One is the Cisco Fog Director, which can be deployed on any type of
    server with Cisco-recommended server specifications [66]. Another example of a
    Fog device manufactured by Cisco is the Fog data services, which are specifically
    designed for IoT [65]. However, Cisco Fog data services can only be deployed on
    Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers. Both will act as Fog servers; however, Cisco
    Fog data services are especially designed for an IoT environment. However, various
    organizations and bodies need to work beyond the proprietary solutions for fast
    technological advancement and technology adoption with a limited budget. Fog devices
    and Fog servers should be deployed in such a way that any type of network management
    device with storage and processing capability can act as a Fog device. Similarly,
    the usual type of server must be able to act as a Fog server. This could be an
    ordinary PC since Fog is not dedicated to performing very complex processing.
    However, further investigation is necessary to explore the minimum system requirement
    for a device that can act as a Fog device or Fog server. Connectivity between
    Fog devices and Fog servers will be via Ethernet or wireless or a serial connection
    in some cases. As an example, Cisco UCS E and C Series Servers, which are generally
    used as Fog servers, are connected to the network via Ethernet. On the other hand,
    Cisco 800 series routers are connected via serial ports that support Fog computation.
    c: Gateway Devices for Fog Many hardware boards are currently available in the
    market including Arduino Yun, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone Black, Arduino
    + Shields, Netduino, Tessel 2, and so on. These boards are currently used as IoT
    and gateway devices and can also be used as Fog gateway devices and as Fog devices.
    These boards have a built-in processor, wired and wireless adapter, and a USB
    port. Fog computing supports device heterogeneity, where a gateway could also
    be a part of the Fog computing environment. Constant et al. [75] developed a Fog
    gateway using Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi. Their proposed Fog gateway integrated
    the data conditioning process, smart analytics, intelligent filtering, and transfer
    to the cloud, which needs long-term storage and temporal variability monitoring.
    The IoT gateway supports various data types and communication protocols between
    devices and sensors. It also unifies the data format from various sensors. Current
    IoT gateways provide a solution for communication and do not support fully automatic
    configurations of newly added IoT devices [76]. Guoqiang et al. [77] proposed
    a smart IoT gateway with three key benefits. The proposed gateway has a unified
    external interface and pluggable architecture. It has a flexible protocol to translate
    various sensor data into a uniform format. The study designed a customized device
    with a Samsung S5PV210 mobile application processor as its gateway. However, this
    gateway did not have any fault tolerance or security features. B. Platform The
    platform manages applications and infrastructure in the Fog environment. It takes
    care of resource allocation, scheduling, fault tolerance, multi-tenancy, security,
    and privacy in Fog computing. Based on the taxonomy of the Fog, we discuss the
    requirements of the platform for Fog computing in this section. 1) Resource Allocation
    and Scheduling Heterogeneous devices are the main challenges in developing proper
    resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog. If we wanted to use the computation
    power of idle devices, we need to schedule tasks on these devices efficiently.
    Otherwise, IoT application processing in the Fog will face complex issues, which
    will hinder the fulfillment of the latency awareness goal. Two of the key requirements
    for resource allocation and scheduling are availability and efficiency. Resources
    in the Fog are not dedicated, and thus availability should be ensured. On the
    other hand, lack of efficient resource allocation and scheduling might lead to
    unwanted delays in the overall processing. 2) Service Requirements Fog services
    can be defined as single or multiple user requests, where the user will constantly
    be updated of the outcome of the service until he or she has a subscription to
    that service. This means that the service outcome will not be fixed and will keep
    changing until the end of the service. The Fog device and Fog server perform the
    intermediate processing, which occurs in between user request and service output.
    The Fog server may communicate with the cloud for processing and information retrieval
    when necessary. For instance, if we considered selecting the best path based on
    real-time traffic in a smart transportation system, the Fog service will keep
    updating on the best path until the end of the journey. In this case, we need
    to take into account mitigation of fault, service quality, network latency, and
    power consumption in order to maintain the standard of the service. a: Fault Tolerance
    Fault tolerance allows a system to keep performing even when a part of the system
    has failed. This failure might be software failure, hardware failure, or network
    failure. The solution for fault tolerance will result in a fully operational system
    where the system will continue its operation with a lower capability instead of
    shutting down totally [78]. Fault tolerance is mostly investigated in the cloud
    [79]–[89]. However, it is necessary to investigate fault tolerance in the Fog
    as well. Although many research works have addressed the need to explore fault
    tolerance issues [5], [9], [64] in Fog computing, none have actually investigated
    the issue. We discuss in more detail the issue of fault tolerance in Section VIII-B.
    b: Quality of Service (QoS) QoS is an important service requirement for Fog computing,
    which is based on reliability, network delay, throughput, and energy consumption.
    Besides these, resource management, power-consumption model, scheduling policy,
    and power failure handling are also important to ensure QoS. If some sensors fail
    for any reason, the accuracy of the outcome or action could be affected. Fog is
    intended to work with latency-sensitive systems; hence, it should maintain high
    reliability with a strict QoS assurance. Otherwise, the latency awareness criteria
    will not be fulfilled. Madsen et al. [90] suggested that the availability of different
    methodologies and algorithms work with the reliability of network connectivity
    and information, to ensure accuracy, which is crucial for building Fog computing-based
    projects. 3) Security and Privacy In this technological era, people are inevitably
    sharing personal information when using different applications and web services.
    Our personal information is no longer personal; it now belongs to many tech giants
    because we are using their free services on a regular basis [91]. A simple example
    is that if anyone used an Android phone without any security settings, the built-in
    Android OS will automatically run GPS and map services, for which it can collect
    all location-related activities about the user. Therefore, information about when
    and which country a user has visited, where a user has dined in, which route a
    user uses for going to the office, home, and so on will be made available to these
    companies. However, these tech giants might argue that they do not disclose our
    data to others, as they can only see our data in our timeline only. However, a
    recent Facebook incident fails to convince us of the honesty of these tech giants
    [92]. The Fog computing paradigm is completely distributed and not intended to
    be centrally managed most of the time. Sensitive data might be processed in an
    intermediate device when the application does not have full control of the device.
    On the other hand, the user will not have full control over the Fog applications.
    Users will require more protective and innovative ways to retain their privacy
    and protect it from any potential and very harmful entities [20]. Similarly, Fog
    application providers also need to develop security to protect their application
    from unwanted data theft. Three different types of security need to be ensured:
    network connection security, data security, and user privacy. Network connection
    security and data security are applicable from both the user and provider perspectives.
    Moreover, user privacy is also important because Fog processing is carried out
    on user data in most cases. 4) Multi-Tenancy Multiple tenants for the same services
    with an isolated runtime for each tenant are referred to as multi-tenancy service.
    Multi-tenancy is important for Fog because of the limited resources in a Fog environment.
    By enabling multi-tenancy, one instance will run in a Fog device and will serve
    multiple tenants (users). Multi-tenancy could be container-based or could be the
    usual virtualization-based. Container-based virtualization is a more lightweight
    and powerful virtualization solution, which the Fog can adopt, to provide the
    fastest processing solution. Container-based virtualization does not need to emulate
    the operating system to facilitate virtualization; thus, it will be easier to
    manage and migrate. Multi-tenancy is a requirement for the platform, and needs
    to be defined before deployment. Multi-tenancy may incur performance degradation
    and security issues [29]; thus, adequate and secure isolation is needed. 5) Management
    The management of the Fog can be centralized or decentralized. Since the devices
    in a Fog environment belong to different domains, centralized management is not
    always possible. Alternatively, processing of IoT applications will be done in
    different Fog clusters, so management will follow a distributed nature in this
    case. In summary, the management of the platform in a Fog must be defined. In
    the case of decentralized management, similar processes must be deployed for different
    Fog devices to handle management issues. C. Application Applications have to fulfill
    certain requirements to execute in a Fog environment. Here, we discuss the features
    required by the applications for execution. 1) Application Requirements a: Scalability
    The number of IoT devices are increasing very swiftly day by day all over the
    world, which raises a new issue of scalability. Thus, we need to deal with the
    scaling of devices and services in the Fog computing environment. Dependency on
    cloud computing has been observed for IoT application processing by many research
    works, where trillions of IoT devices are involved, such as that of Li et al.
    [93]. However, implementation of the whole application in the cloud in such an
    environment where IoT devices are generating a huge amount of data is neither
    feasible nor efficient. IoT devices are not only stationary but also mobile in
    most cases. Hence, maintaining frequently changing device states and availability
    in the cloud is not an easy task. Also, with the growing number of IoT devices,
    it would be more critical for IoT applications to query and select IoT devices
    [59]. The Fog computing system must be an autonomous system where application
    execution by the participating device will be done automatically including scalability.
    b: Heterogeneity For any IoT system, the heterogeneous device is a fundamental
    characteristic where device heterogeneity co-exists at any level in the Fog computing
    paradigm. Abstraction of device complexity is also required to some extent. Device
    heterogeneity does not only refer to the diversity of services and protocols,
    but also the assortment of horizontal and vertical levels of the Fog architecture
    [59]. To address this heterogeneity, Giang et al. [59], classified three types
    of Fog devices: compute, input/output (IO), and edge nodes. Edge nodes are the
    sensors and the actuators, IO nodes are the resource-limited devices mostly responsible
    for brokering communications, and computing nodes offer computing facilities.
    Of the three types of nodes, IO and compute nodes are mostly dynamic and customizable
    or programmable as required. It is possible to implement all three nodes in a
    single device based on its capability and design goal. The smart gateway is an
    example of such implementation. In order to use the capability of various types
    of devices in an IoT environment, it is obvious that the application must be designed
    in such a way that it might be able to perform its task execution on multiple
    devices regardless of its capacity and location. More precisely, the application
    should able to use maximum available computation resources through middleware.
    c: Interaction Timeliness The perception-action (PA) cycle is the basic function
    of a nervous system, which maintains circular flow between sensory organisms and
    its actions towards the functionality of that sensing. The PA cycle is also a
    characteristic of IoT applications, where the cloud and Fog infrastructure satisfies
    timeliness requirements and application logic for communication. Giang et al.
    [59] identified four interaction models for the PA cycle in a Fog environment.
    Examples of these models are: (i) in a local network, communication between devices,
    which is considered as an immediate cycle action, (ii) interaction with the cloud
    from a device of a local network, which is generally for time-insensitive actions,
    (iii) an interaction generated by the cloud to a device in a local network, which
    requires semi-immediate actions, and (iv) communication among IoT-related applications
    in the cloud. However, their work considered the role of the Fog server, which
    manages and maintains several Fog devices in a specific cluster. On the other
    hand, PA interaction can be divided into immediate, semi-immediate, and delayed
    action to leverage IoT application requirements more efficiently. Delayed action
    can be performed on the type of processing that does not have any timeliness issues
    and could be processed by the cloud infrastructure. d: Mobility Device mobility
    is a natural probability and is one of the key requirements for implementing an
    IoT platform [59]. From the Fog perspective, it is not only the edge devices that
    will be mobile but also computing and storage devices in the Fog layer. Managing
    mobile devices in two different planes and syncing them with each other is challenging.
    To ensure resource availability and successful task completion, task distribution,
    duplication, and migration is required. This mechanism is already considered in
    the cloud but there is a need to reinvestigate them by considering mobility [94].
    2) User Requirements User requirements can be changed by various constraints.
    First of all, a user may want to complete the submitted task within a specific
    time binding, which is referred to as the deadline. Secondly, the user may set
    some constraints for the budget. Thirdly, in the case of some users, they may
    not care about the budget but the response time is of utmost importance. Fourthly,
    some users may want tolerable accuracy. This means that the user may not seek
    accurate results but rather fast results that could be provided with some reasonable
    errors. Aazam and Huh [54] suggested that pre-allocation and prediction of resources
    rely on user behavior and the probability of future utilization of resources.
    Dastjerdi et al. [4], [95] stated that edge devices perform optimization by considering
    user behavior and network condition. 3) Application Modeling Two types of application
    modeling are possible by considering the requirements of applications in the Fog.
    Most IoT devices generate tuples periodically, which can be considered as a stream.
    These streams need to be processed in real time to get accurate results. Alternatively,
    the application that does the processing based on previously stored sets of data
    could include microservice-based applications. The advantage of microservice is
    that it can bind all functionality and required libraries in a single service,
    which can run above the microservice controller without dependency. Hence, application
    modeling in Fog could be stream-based or microservice-based. SECTION VII. Dimension
    of Fog Computing-Based Applications Several applications require a Fog computing
    infrastructure to provide smooth services. These include smart transportation
    systems, Augmented and Virtual reality, healthcare, video streaming, smart homes,
    and smart cities. Requirements of platform and applications are also needed in
    order to provide services. In this section, we discuss some research works, which
    specifically address the application of Fog computing. We evaluate each work based
    on their contribution on the Fog infrastructure, platform, and applications as
    defined in our taxonomy. It is obvious that all three kinds of services are interrelated.
    However, each researcher only focused on one or more of these aspects. Mapping
    related works with our proposed taxonomy will help in finding the research gaps
    in Fog computing applications. A. Smart Transportation System Several research
    works have been carried out on smart transportation systems that use Fog computing.
    In this section we discuss a few works that have been done on the Fog-based smart
    transportation system and then identify key issues that need to be addressed.
    Truong et al. [96] pproposed a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANETs) architecture
    called Fog Software Defined Networking (FSDN), which combines SDN and Fog together
    to provide a better solution. As SDN has programmability, flexibility, global
    knowledge, and scalability features and Fog has location awareness and time sensitivity,
    the combination of these two will leverage on the key challenges in VANETs. The
    proposed system is able to augment communication among vehicles, infrastructure,
    and base stations via centralized control, besides reducing latency and optimizing
    the utilization of resources. However, the central SDN controller of the proposed
    system is where the bottleneck of the proposed system occurs. The system is focused
    on infrastructure and network requirements. The Fog controller is used for service
    implementation. The work did not focus on platform and application requirements.
    Investigation of VANETs in Fog has also been done in Giang et al. [97], where
    they explored how smart transportation applications (VANETs) are developed using
    the Fog Computing approach. Driving vehicles in an urban area requires immediate
    decision on various activities such as route changing, lane change, slowing down
    speed, looking at obstacles, and so on. Hence, applications need to gather all
    related details to act on these activities. The authors discussed Fog-based smart
    transportation application requirements such as programming abstraction and application
    models. The work explored application modeling but not other application aspects
    nor infrastructure or platform. B. Vehicles as Fog Infrastructure Hou et al. [98]
    proposed the idea of Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC), which will use the vehicle
    as an infrastructure for computation and communication. The VFC architecture utilizes
    vehicle computation resources by providing service to the edge devices located
    near them. It will aggregate abundant resources of each moving car by which service
    quality can be enhanced. Using quantitative analysis on different scenarios, they
    discovered an interesting relationship among connectivity, mobility, communication
    capability, and parking behavior. These four characteristics help us understand
    resource utilization of vehicle resources, which will help achieve better utilization
    of unused resources. C. Augmented and Virtual Reality Augmented Reality applications
    are extremely time sensitive; a small delay can lead to serious errors in user
    experience. Thus, Fog computing-based solutions will have great potential in this
    domain [4]. These statements are also applicable for connected Virtual Reality
    (VR) or VR-based games. Zao et al. [99] proposed an augmented brain computer interaction
    game, which utilized the Fog and cloud infrastructure. The Fog performed real-time
    analysis such as signal processing that needs to classify the brain state and
    other analyses such as model classification updated from the cloud. However, their
    work only focused on the Fog infrastructure but neglected most aspects regarding
    platform and application. D. Healthcare The Fog computing approach also enables
    real-time sensor-based healthcare services. Rahmani et al. [100] proposed a Fog-assisted
    system architecture for the healthcare system. A smart e-health gateway is the
    key component of this architecture, which will process the generated data from
    the sensors and generate an Early Warning Score (EWS) to notify for any medical
    emergency. They considered many aspects of our taxonomy; but it is necessary to
    investigate each aspect extensively, which this study did not. Another Fog-based
    healthcare architecture was proposed by Mahmud et al. [26]. Their work mainly
    focused on network delay, power consumption, and communication optimization in
    Fog-based healthcare service. However, platform, application, and user requirements
    were not investigated. E. Smart City Smart city-related applications need to process
    sensor data on a real-time basis, where Fog computing can play a major role. Giordano
    et al. [101] proposed a Rainbow architecture, which supports various applications
    in a smart city. The proposed Rainbow framework evaluated three smart city applications
    including noise pollution mapping, urban drainage networks, and smart street.
    The work proposed a distributed agent-based approach in the intermediate layer
    in between the physical infrastructure and cloud. However, the work did not focused
    on application and platform aspects except for application modeling. Table 4 shows
    a summary of the above-discussed Fog-based applications mapped to our proposed
    taxonomy. In summary, it can be concluded that most of the works have focused
    on infrastructure and application modeling. There is a research gap on application-
    and platform-related aspects, which need to be explored further. TABLE 4 Evaluation
    of Existing Works on Fog Applications SECTION VIII. State-of-the-Art Fog Computing
    In this section, we focus on some existing research works on Fog computing. We
    discuss research works from four different research areas of Fog computing. These
    areas are resource allocation and scheduling, failure handling, simulation tools,
    and microservices. A. Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Computing Fog
    computing is fast evolving and growing rapidly due to its edge-level computation
    and heterogeneous nature. In this section, we present several research works,
    which have been done in the past couple of years. We also summarize the presented
    research works with a comparative discussion to address research gaps in this
    area. Most of the reviewed works are related to resource allocation and scheduling
    in the cloud and Fog environment. However, some works have only been done in the
    Fog environment. 1) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for Fog-Cloud Environment
    Alsaar et al. [102] proposed resource allocation methods for a collaborative platform
    composed of Fog and cloud paradigms. Their proposed algorithm is grounded on linearized
    decision tree rules by considering three different conditions for managing user
    request and for balancing workload. The conditions are VM capacity, completion
    time, and service size. Each condition has two branches: the VM capacity branches
    out to enough or not enough; the completion time consists of now or later, and
    the service size is divided into small or large. In some cases, this includes
    services in the queue, which will be represented with yes or no. They utilized
    1/m/m/1, with (1)/ representing cloud broker, /(m) for many paths, /(m) for many
    Fog brokers, and /(1) for IoT device users. Using this method, the total overhead
    for big data processing in the system was reduced. In their work, the availability
    of cloud servers and the Fog was guaranteed and a fast response time to satisfy
    QoS was achieved. The SLA for users was also different, where shared and reserved
    resource was provided. However, availability and QoS were not studied extensively.
    Deng et al. [103] presented a framework for workload allocation in the cloud and
    Fog environment to examine power consumption-delay trade-off issues. They defined
    the workload allocation problem into primary and sub-problems, which can be solved
    via related sub-systems. They employed a Hungarian algorithm and Generalized Benders
    Decomposition (GBD) algorithm to solve the problem. Numerical and simulation results
    were presented to prove that the Fog is a complement to the cloud. However, the
    complex nature of workload and resource was not studied in their work. Brogi et
    al. [104] prototyped a tool known as ‘FogTorch ∏ ’ which is capable of fulfilling
    hardware, software, and QoS requirements before deploying a composite application
    in the Fog infrastructure. The proposed tool manipulates Monte Carlo simulations
    and only considers communication link QoS. Resource consumption and QoS assurance
    terms were undertaken for classifying the eligibility of deployments. The proposed
    algorithm was based on the preprocessing phase and backtracking search phase.
    To find eligible deployment, the preprocessing used input from results derived
    by the backtracking search algorithm. However, availability and latency are more
    important in the Fog environment compared to resource consumption and communication
    links. In order to ensure efficient use of resources and network infrastructure
    in the Fog and cloud environment, Taneja and Davy [105] proposed a Module Mapping
    Algorithm, which efficiently deploys IoT Application Modules in the composite
    Fog-Cloud Infrastructure. They employed lower-bound searches and compared function
    algorithms to find an eligible network node in the Fog and cloud. The Module Mapping
    algorithm returned a map with nodes, which are appropriate for completing the
    computation operation. If the application requires faster processing, the application
    will be deployed close to the source device. However, the work considered CPU,
    RAM, and bandwidth to find the best resources. In such a case, the cloud resource
    will always be the best resource, so it will be necessary to consider other parameters
    such as response time and availability of the specified resources. Yin et al.
    [52] studied a Fog-assisted big data streaming scenario, where Fog devices are
    responsible for preprocessing raw data for applications hosted in the cloud using
    the unused resources of Fog devices. In their work, the software-defined network
    (SDN) controller continuously adjusted the volume of data to be sent to the Fog
    device for pre-processing. The collaborative computation problem was defined as
    a social welfare maximization problem and a hybrid alternating direction method
    of multiplier (H-ADMM) algorithm was proposed to minimize computation burden via
    the dynamic distribution of Fog devices, cloud, and SDN using message exchanging.
    The formulation of social welfare maximization problem determined the size of
    data that will be assigned to a Fog device. During the formulation, loss of information
    value by preprocessing and the operation cost of the Fog and cloud were considered.
    The work completely depended on the cloud for post-processing, but pre- and post-processing
    could have been done in the Fog to support time-sensitive real-time applications.
    Aazam et al. [106] proposed a dynamic resource estimation algorithm by integrating
    the historical record of cloud service customer (CSC) in a Fog environment based
    on the relinquish probability. The minimum relinquish probability value is 0.1
    and this value will be increased based on the history of the user. However, for
    fair resource estimation, the relinquish probability will be 0.3 for new customers.
    For existing and returning customers, the characteristics of the customer are
    known, so the probability value can be calculated easily. In this way, resource
    underutilization could be minimized and the chances of profit loss will be low.
    2) Resource Allocation and Scheduling for a Fog Environment A resource allocation
    strategy based on priced timed Petri nets (PTPNs) was proposed by Ni et al. [107]
    for Fog computing. The main idea of this work is that the user can choose the
    satisfying resources autonomously from a pre-allocated resource group. With credibility
    evaluation for both users and Fog infrastructure, their proposed strategy comprehensively
    considers the cost for time and price to complete the tasks. The user that has
    a high credit limit will be able to allocate highly reliable resources to complete
    their tasks. Due to the dynamic nature of creditability of users and resources,
    there will be some deviation in calculating them properly. To maintain QoS, the
    resources will be ordered according to their processing capacity and divided into
    several groups. Moreover, users with similar credibility will be assigned to several
    groups. Pooranian et al. [108] proposed a simple algorithm to find an optimal
    solution for resource allocation. They considered the problem as a bin packing
    penalty aware problem where servers are bins and VMs are the pack. Based on idle
    energy, maximum frequency, and maximum energy, each server will be palatalized
    and rewarded. The method will calculate how many VMs could be allocated in t time
    slot on a server. The VMs will be served based on their frequency and time limitations.
    As a consequence of penalty, a server will be punished in the form of being banned
    from use for a few iterations. Once the server passes the iteration freeze, it
    will return to the stream to perform further computation. The penalty and reward
    methods are applied to minimize exponentially increasing energy consumption. Sun
    and Zhang [63] proposed a crowd-funding algorithm for a Fog environment, integrating
    idle resources in the local network. An incentive mechanism was used to encourage
    resource owners to participate in the computation and enthusiastically perform
    their tasks. Through the comprehensive reward and punishment mechanism, it is
    ensured that the participant will positively perform the tasks. This work is similar
    to the above-described literature proposed by Pooranian et al. [108]. However,
    in this case, the reward and punishment go to the participant rather than the
    physical server. 3) Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling in Fog Based
    on the related research on resource allocation and scheduling in the Fog, a summary
    is presented in Table 5. From this table, we can see that most of the researchers
    have focused on resource allocation in the Fog. More research works are therefore
    required to investigate resource sharing and workload allocation. Also, further
    investigation is needed to address energy-efficiency, load balancing, SLA, and
    QoS in the Fog. We identified two major issues in Fog computing research. Firstly,
    researchers tend to use a synthetic workload to validate their methods and algorithms.
    Secondly, most of the researchers used cloud-based simulations, which are not
    that convincing because the Fog is more heterogeneous and dynamic in nature. Thus,
    further investigation into workload generation and simulations in the Fog need
    to be undertaken. TABLE 5 Summary of Resource Allocation and Scheduling Research
    in Fog B. Fault Tolerance in Fog Computing The Fog computing paradigm is a highly
    distributed heterogeneous platform where the probability of device failure is
    very high compared to the cloud. Since the Fog is evolving, no study has yet been
    done on fault tolerance in Fog computing. However, fault tolerance has been mostly
    studied in the cloud computing paradigm. Often, fault tolerance is measured by
    availability. In the cloud, faults are handled by proactive fault tolerance and
    reactive fault tolerance techniques at either the workflow level or task level.
    Reactive fault tolerance techniques are used to reduce the impact of failures
    on a system when the failures have actually occurred. Techniques based on this
    policy are job migration, checkpoint/restart, replication, rollback and recovery,
    task resubmission, user-defined exception handling, and workflow rescue. Proactive
    fault tolerance predicts the faults pro-actively and replaces the suspected components
    with other working components; thus, avoiding recovery from faults and errors.
    Proactive Fault Tolerance uses self-healing, preemptive migration, and software
    rejuvenation, which are the few proactive fault tolerance techniques in the cloud.
    According to Sharma et al. [110], the causes of failure in the cloud varies, and
    include software and hardware failure, service failure, overflow failure, power
    outage, outdated systems, network failure, cyber attacks, and human errors. It
    is crucial to handle faults in Fog computing for which the fault needs to be considered
    at every step, not only for processing but also for the transmit-and-receive process
    [111]. In this section, we discuss some existing research works on fault tolerance
    in cloud computing. We specifically focus on resource and task failure mechanisms.
    Then, we summarize the existing works and present a research direction for failure
    handling in Fog computing. Jiang and Hsu [112] proposed a two-level standby design
    for handling server failure in the cloud system. In their proposed system, cold
    and warm standby of the system is made available. Once any server fails, the warm
    standby system will replace the failed server and the failed server will be sent
    to the repair house. After repairing, the system will be placed in the cold standby
    group. The systems in the cold standby group are in a completely switched off
    mode. The work proposed a model to determine the necessary number of cold and
    warm standby systems in the cloud. However, this type of hardware failure handling
    is not suitable for the Fog because most of the time Fog computing devices will
    not be under the property of the Fog provider. Hence, task migration is the best
    solution for hardware failure and this should be reactive in most cases, except
    where the Fog device belongs to the provider. Latiff et al. [113] proposed a cloud-scheduling
    scheme based on a check-pointed league championship algorithm. They employed a
    task migration method for independent task execution failure. In their proposed
    method, the system state will be saved periodically by check-pointing, so the
    task need not start from the beginning once it fails. When the task fails, it
    will be assigned to an underloaded VM and the league championship algorithm will
    be employed to schedule the failed tasks. Wu et al. [114] proposed a fault tolerance
    technique using migration to the cloud. The failure handling method is proactive,
    which always monitors the host and continuously tries to predict the chances of
    failure. If the prediction becomes true, the system will look up other available
    resources and then migration will be performed. The proposed method will monitor
    CPU temperature, memory usage, and CPU fan speed, etc. To employ such a technique
    in Fog computing, further investigation is needed because the types of device
    in Fog are diverse. A combined method of check-pointing and migration-based proactive
    failure handling was proposed by Egwutuoha et al. [115] for HPC and cloud. In
    the proposed method, the authors used a Lm-sensors open source software tool for
    computer health monitoring. From the monitoring data, they defined rule-based
    monitoring depending on temperature, fan speed, voltage, and processor utilization
    to predict failure. The rules are denoted as 1, 2, and 3, representing normal,
    warning, and critical state, respectively. They employed three different policies
    for migration. The first depends on the necessity lease additional node. The second
    removes the node, which is unhealthy based on the state. In the third, the critical
    state publishes to the head node. Finally, the system administrator is notified
    for further action. This type of approach might increase the overhead in the Fog;
    however, further exploration is essential. A recent study shows that proactive
    fault tolerance is the best solution for the cloud compared to redundant solutions
    [88]. However, failure prediction accuracy is the key factor for these kinds of
    solutions. Their work considered software, hardware, and unstable behavior to
    predict the failure of the infrastructure. More specifically, they defined failure
    based on an error formula err=(ActualTime−PredictedTime)/ActualTime×100% , which
    was derived from [118] and [119]. A combination of the proactive and reactive
    method was applied by Gao et al. [118] to handle task failure in the cloud environment.
    The crash detection method and replication factor were proposed in this work to
    handle failures. Table 6 shows a summary of the investigated literature on fault
    tolerance in the cloud. TABLE 6 Summary of Investigated Fault Tolerance Literature
    in Cloud Because of its unstable nature of failure and heterogeneous characteristics,
    the hybrid failure handling method is more appropriate for the Fog computing environment.
    C. Simulation Tools for Fog Computing Simulation and modeling in Fog computing
    are still in their infancy. However, a few research works have been done on Fog
    computing simulation, which are focused on some specific aspect of Fog computing.
    Aazam and Huh [54] focused on resource prediction and pricing in Fog computing.
    The Proposed Fog-based resource management model is able to estimate the required
    resources based on the probability of user behavior of future resource use. Validation
    and performance evaluation was done using simulation. However, they did not consider
    service heterogeneity, QoS, or device mobility factors. Another work proposed
    by Dastjerdi et al. [4] focused on dag of the query for incident detection in
    a smart city use case. Both of these works used CloudSim [119] to validate their
    method along with an experimental evaluation. The first toolkit for Fog simulation
    was developed by Gupta et al. [120], known as iFogSim. The toolkit is used for
    the simulation and modeling of IoT resource management techniques in the Fog and
    edge computing paradigms. The most challenging problem is the design of resource
    management techniques, which determine analytic application distribution among
    edge devices, which will improve the throughput and reduce latency. The proposed
    simulator is capable of measuring the impact of resource management techniques
    in terms of network congestion, latency, cost, and energy consumption. The simulator
    was validated using two use cases and the authors also proposed a Fog computing
    environment architecture. Challenges in Fog computing deployment are include incorporating
    Fog with Emerging Technologies such as 5G Technologies [121], Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV), and Software-defined Networking (SDN). In this case, a simulator
    with container, SDN, and NFV support is crucial. Table 7 presents the key features
    of these two simulators that are mostly used by various researchers for Fog computing
    simulation. These two simulation tools did not focus on network parameters such
    as bandwidth distribution of the link and round-trip delay of the various media.
    These two parameters heavily affect the simulation results where minimization
    of latency is the key goal in a Fog computing environment. Secondly, both tools
    did not consider container-based virtualization. In a Fog computing environment,
    there are many devices that will participate in computation, where hypervisor-based
    virtualization is nearly impossible to implement due to the lower memory and processing
    power of these devices. TABLE 7 Simulation Tools Used for Fog Simulation and Their
    Key Features D. Fog-Based Micro Services A microservice is an independent process
    and Software-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that interacts by message passing. The
    SOA of microservice does not hinder or favor any specific programming model. It
    provides design and implementation guidelines for distributed applications to
    partition each component independently. Each of the components addresses a specific
    functionality. The functionality of the components can be accessed by message
    passing and is possible to implement in any mainstream programming language internally.
    In this way, this principle helps developers and project managers to develop each
    module independently and test it with a few related functions. Some microservices,
    also known as high-level microservices, are mainly responsible for coordination
    with other microservices [124]. The organizational approach of microservices accelerates
    the development cycle, nourishes ownership, encourages innovation, improves scalability,
    and enhances the maintainability of software applications. Using this approach,
    software becomes a small independent service and interacts over unambiguous APIs.
    These services are preserved via self-contained small teams [125]. The agility
    and independent distributed nature of microservice deployment makes it a good
    solution for Fog-based IoT application development. Independent processes and
    interaction via message passing features has made microservices more convenient
    for IoT applications. In the Fog, there is a limitation of resources, so developing
    microservices in the Fog will minimize the growing complexity of the big system
    by dividing it into a set of small independent services. Microservice is taking
    modularity to a subsequent level by incorporating high cohesion and loose coupling
    of distributed systems. 1) Current Research Aspects of Microservice Recently,
    microservice-based applications have started gaining popularity [124]. Fog-based
    microservices have not been investigated extensively; hence, it is an open research
    area. However, some research works have been done in this emerging research area,
    with most of the efforts being related to IoT. Butzin et al. [126] investigated
    the use of microservices in IoT and claimed that the architectural goal of IoT
    and microservices are similar. However, they actually have different features
    in terms of various aspects. First of all, microservice has a self-containment
    feature where all dependencies and libraries are packed with the application in
    a single image. On the other hand, for IoT, all libraries are not generally wrapped
    with the application. However, both use similar types of virtualization and web
    protocols. Microservice also has a continuous integration and delivery feature
    while in IoT these are not available or only partly exist. Vresk and Čavrak [127]
    proposed a microservice-based middleware for IoT to support device heterogeneity,
    various communication protocols, and services. They presented a data model and
    address model for microservice-based IoT. Brito et al. [128] proposed a service
    orchestration architecture for Fog using microservices. The authors defined the
    resource manager as a microservice. Khazaei et al. [129] proposed a generic programmable
    self-managing microservice-based platform for IoT. In the platform, microservices
    will exist in all layers in a cascading manner and an autonomic management system
    will scale the microservice. A similar type of IoT framework was proposed by Sun
    et al. [130]. In their architecture of nine components, all are microservices
    except for the core service. The work proved that microservices are far better
    than the monolithic approach in terms of scalability, flexibility, and platform
    independence. However, still, microservice-based IoT architecture suffers from
    various issues such as faults in the network, network delay, message serialization,
    cooperative transaction processing, and other distributed computing scenarios.
    Li et al. [131] proposed a cooperative-based model specifically for smart sensing
    devices; it is possible to enhance the performance of such a service by undertaking
    a micro-service based concept. Krivic et al. [132] proposed a management solution
    for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) device communication in an IoT system using collaborative
    microservice. They argued that microservices could act as the agent in an agent-based
    system since each microservice is responsible for performing a specific task and
    acts collaboratively to achieve the system goal. Container-based virtualization
    is the best solution for deploying microservices since the container supports
    OS virtualization and packs all dependencies in a single image. A container is
    able to manage physical hardware resource needed by an application with its OS
    kernel utilities [133]. 2) Microservices and IoT Applications Many research works
    have suggested Fog-based processing for IoT applications in smart transportation
    systems [96]–[98], Augmented and Virtual Reality [99], [134], [135], and healthcare
    [26], [136], [137]. Fog computing is also suitable for video streaming, smart
    homes, smart cities, and CDN. The common characteristics of these applications
    are time-sensitiveness, which make Fog computing a promising emerging computing
    paradigm. The main drawback of the Fog, however, is resource limitation and failure.
    Thus, using microservices for Fog-based IoT applications will minimize these drawbacks.
    Microservices are standalone, lightweight, and easily deliverable. To mitigate
    resource limitation, the microservice-based container is the best solution so
    far. In the same way, it will also minimize the cost of failure by deploying the
    application immediately. Many open research issues can be addressed by implementing
    Fog-based micro services; these include service management, scheduling, monitoring,
    fault tolerance, security, and privacy. E. Fog Based Mobile Computing The number
    of smartphone and mobile device users in urban areas as well as in rural areas
    is increasing day by day. As a result, mobile users are now requesting high-volume
    content collaboratively. Providing service for all requested contents in an area
    where mobile users are densely populated is a really challenging task for service
    providers [138]. The high number of concurrent content requests will only make
    the situation worse. One of the best solutions to cope with this problem is to
    offload content near the users, so that the users could get better service. This
    content offloading process can be supported by mobile Fog computing. In mobile
    Fog computing, content will be offloaded to the Fog device, which is located closer
    to the users. However, content management in Fog nodes is a current research issue.
    Depending on the demand of the contents, offloading should be distributed on the
    Fog nodes. Constant monitoring and efficient cache management is crucial to deal
    with resource-limited Fog nodes. A few research works have been done on mobile
    Fog computing. This section chronologically discusses the research works that
    have been done in this particular research area in the past couple of years. Hong
    et al. [94] proposed a high-level programming model that supports large-scale
    geospatially distributed time-sensitive applications. The proposed Mobile Fog
    programming model has two design goals. The initial goal is to provide a simplified
    application development for an enormous number of heterogenous devices, which
    are distributed in a wide area. The next goal is the dynamic scaling of resources
    based on resource demand. They developed an API for their programming model and
    evaluated it using two application models: vehicle tracking using a camera and
    traffic monitoring using a Mobility-driven distributed Complex Event Processing
    (MCEP) system. However, they did not focus on process placement or process migration.
    Shi et al. [139] proposed a P2P inspired communication model between the mobile
    device cloud and mobile nodes to share resources and computation task among mobile
    devices. In their work, they utilized a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    for implementing microservices. This work introduced the M2M approach in Fog computing
    while the classical Fog is actually hierarchy based. Content offloading in the
    mobile Fog was investigated by Khan et al. [138]. They defined mobile Fog as co-located
    self-organizing mobile nodes, which offer distributed resources at the edge. The
    aim of this work was to collaborate nodes for content caching, which will maximize
    the availability of the content and minimize operational cost. The proposed coalition
    game helps find the best co-located candidates near the users for sharing storage
    and self-organizing. Wang et al. [140] proposed a three-layer hierarchy framework
    using a Fog structure to bridge the communication between WSNs and the cloud.
    They designed a routing algorithm for bridging communication by considering the
    number of hops and energy consumption. They defined the Fog node as a sink, which
    will transfer data from sensor to the cloud. The proposed framework consists of
    routing layer, Fog layer, and sink layer. In the Fog layer, a sink acts as the
    Fog nodes as well to minimize transmission delay. However, there is a lack of
    security and privacy concern being addressed in mobile Fog computing. Roman et
    al. [141] addressed security and privacy for all edge-level computing. This included
    a usual thread in a network system mobile Fog that requires extra measures of
    authentication, trust, access control, protocol, and network security. SECTION
    IX. Open Issues and Future Research Directions A. Infrastructure-Related Issues
    The Fog is an evolving technology, expanding in such a way that it needs to reach
    market adoption to support all kinds of time-sensitive applications. The Fog has
    become an enactment of research efforts by various academies and industries. One
    of the key initiatives is the Open Fog Consortium (OpenFog), which was founded
    by the ARM, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and Princeton University in November
    2015 [31]. Foxconn, General Electric, Hitachi, Sakura Internet, ShanghaiTech University,
    and ZTE are the contributing members of this nonprofit consortium. They are accelerating
    digital innovation with the blending of 5G wireless technology, IoT, and embedded
    AI by providing open interoperable architecture. However, many open challenges
    exist for this sprout-level computing paradigm. In this section, we discuss the
    research challenges and address the future directions for Fog computing research.
    Figure 10 shows some important research issues in Fog computing. FIGURE 10. Fog
    computing research issues. Show All 1) Deployment Issues From the deployment viewpoint,
    OpenFog is defined as an N-tier environment. However, the excessive increase in
    number of levels in the Fog layer might cause latency problems in the newly emerging
    Fog computing paradigm. Therefore, the number of tiers based on the use case must
    be determined. Deployment decisions will be undertaken based on requirements such
    as type and amount of task that will be done by each tier, total number of sensors,
    Fog device capability, in between the latency and reliability of Fog devices.
    Still, it is necessary to investigate how these requirements will be fulfilled.
    Application and resource scaling is also an important issue during deployment.
    Based on the requirement of the application and resource, scaling and shrinking
    without interrupting current services could be undertaken. In this regard, placement
    might also affect Fog deployment. 2) Standard Architecture for Fog Computing Up
    until now, there has been no defined standard architecture for Fog computing.
    The OpenFog consortium released two versions of the Fog architecture in February
    2016 [61] and February 2017 [142]. Their first draft was an initial overview of
    the Fog architecture. In their second draft, the Fog architecture was discussed
    in more detail. In their proposed architecture, they considered many key aspects
    of Fog architecture including performance, manageability, security, data analytics,
    and control. However, further research needs to be undertaken to explore and gain
    deeper insight into each layer with proper validation. 3) Interoperability and
    Federation of Fog Because of the Fog, users are able to process their request
    near them, which will minimize latency. However, what will happen if an increasing
    number of multiple latency-aware applications requests are sent in one shot to
    the Fog device and the Fog device is unable to handle that many requests? Will
    it be passed to the cloud for processing? If it is passed to the cloud, then latency
    requirements will not be satisfied. Thus, interoperability and federation among
    Fog clusters and Fog servers are necessary. Hence, if a Fog device is fully utilized,
    it will send requests to peer Fog devices or Fog servers for processing instead
    of sending them to the cloud. B. Platform-Related Issues 1) Resource Management
    Resources are most dynamic and heterogeneous in a Fog environment because of the
    diversity of devices and their available resources. All devices known as Fog devices
    are responsible for performing the computation of their own application. For example,
    a computer that relies on office staff to perform some ordinary email and documentation
    works might be a part of the Fog and might also act as a Fog device. In such a
    case, the amount of resources available for Fog computation is dynamic but predictable
    via the analysis of the long-term activity of its resources. This prediction is
    necessary because once the Fog task execution starts, and over a period of time,
    the status of the resources might change due to the request by the application
    for which the device is responsible for. If we compared this to the cloud, it
    is possible to know how much resources are currently available and whether or
    not they are exclusively used for cloud-based application requests. However, the
    Fog aims to use idle resources available on any Fog device with Fog computation
    always taking second priority. Hence, resource allocation and scheduling in the
    Fog is more challenging than traditional resource allocation and scheduling in
    the cloud. 2) Failure Management Fog device failure probability is always high
    because the devices are distributed and the management of Fog devices is not central.
    Hence, the devices could fail for many reasons; this could be due to hardware
    failure, software failure, or because of user activity. Besides these problems,
    some other reasons include connectivity, mobility, and power source, which also
    play a big role. Most of the devices in a Fog environment might be connected via
    wireless connections; it is obvious that wireless connections are not always reliable.
    The majority of devices that are connected via wireless are mobile, so these devices
    could change location to different clusters frequently. One other characteristic
    of these devices is that they are battery powered and might fail anytime. Hence,
    dealing with the complex nature of failure is very difficult. Also, it is necessary
    to ensure SLA by defining QoS parameters. So, the question is: What are the SLAs
    and how should they be defined? Also: What QoS parameters must be considered,
    so that the consumer and providers can retain a win-win situation? 3) Communication
    Between Different Layers The Fog should ensure uninterrupted connection with the
    devices to ensure application requirements of time-sensitive applications are
    met. If the application were to control an autonomous car or drone and if it were
    responsible for emergency surveillance, then failure in connectivity might cause
    serious harm. Even if connectivity to the cloud fails, the Fog still needs to
    ensure continuous connectivity. Thus, cross-layer connectivity among IoT devices,
    Fog, and cloud are of the utmost importance. The connection type and protocols
    used by IoT devices and Fog devices might be different. Therefore, how these issues
    will be handled is an important research issue. 4) User Participation Management
    Efficient Fog service management depends on the participation of users in Fog
    computation. However, how can user participation be managed? How do we deploy
    minimum resources in the case where no one wants to participate? We need to address
    these problems clearly with a feasible solution. One of the methods to increase
    user participation is through incentive and reward-based policies. With such policies,
    any user that participates in Fog computation will benefit. Even a user, who participates
    to complete his own request, will be rewarded by getting some discount based on
    his participation. However, this area needs to be addressed because the overall
    success of Fog computation depends on the participation of Fog devices, which
    are owned by various people and organizations. 5) Security and Privacy Fog devices
    are managed by different operators based on their location and ownership. Nobody
    would want to contribute to Fog computation if device control were compromised.
    Thus, how the security of a participant device will be maintained if the device
    were to take part in Fog computation is a big question. Another key security issue
    for this scenario is participant user data security. A participant device might
    have critical information. How will safety be guaranteed in such a case? On the
    other hand, critical data might be processed in a device, which is owned by a
    black hat hacker. How will safety and privacy be ensured then? Security issues
    also exist during cross-layer communication. Similar to the distributed nature
    of the Fog, security management should also be distributed, which will not be
    dependent on any central component. C. Application-Related Issues 1) Application
    Service Management Billions of IoT devices will be handled by the Fog paradigm,
    which will handle time-sensitive and time-insensitive applications. The degree
    of service, availability, and quality is most diverse in the Fog. Hence, service
    management is a typical issue for the entire Fog realm. Services should be microservice-based,
    so that agility and management issues can be handled properly. Further research
    is necessary to explore the possibility of Fog-based solutions. 2) Application
    Modeling Modeling Fog applications is complex because the application should collect
    data from different IoT devices, which use different protocols and sets of codes.
    Thus, it is challenging to model generic applications, which can be deployed with
    minimal effort. To solve this issue, a standard form of communication protocol
    is necessary, so that the modeled application can communicate and work with different
    types of IoT devices. SECTION X. Conclusion The Fog computing paradigm is currently
    in its infancy, so an extensive investigation is required for this emerging technology.
    In this survey, we presented and discussed the overview, architecture, state-of-the-art
    and other similar technologies in Fog computing. Based on the literature, we derived
    a taxonomy for Fog computing by analyzing the requirement of Fog infrastructure,
    platform, and applications. We also covered resource allocation and scheduling,
    fault tolerance, simulation tools, and microservices in Fog computing. Finally,
    we presented some challenging and open research issues. We strongly believe that
    this comprehensive survey will bring to light IoT application execution for a
    Fog computing environment as well as point towards the direction for current and
    future research in this rapidly growing research area. In this way, this computing
    paradigm, which is still immature, will be propelled towards achieving market
    adoption in the near future. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors would like to sincerely

    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download
    high-res image (464KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Percentage
    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

  analysis: The paper presents a design method using Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms
    and discusses its deployment to provide farmers with smart automated irrigation
    systems that can be implemented in both new and existing facilities. The method
    focuses on the initial stages of the automated irrigation management pipeline,
    covering data collection, edge and fog computing, real-time data transmission
    protocols and technologies, and the challenges and solutions associated with real-time
    data transmission. It promotes a user-centred design model to obtain knowledge
    and experience to introduce technology into agricultural applications. IoT paradigms
    are employed as resources to assist decision-making. The proposed architecture,
    operating rules, and smart processes are implemented using a distributed model
    based on edge and fog computing paradigms. A communication architecture utilizing
    these technologies is also proposed. The paper aims to equip farmers with the
    tools to develop smart systems.

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\
    \ (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote\nequipment\
    \ and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart\
    \ logistics\nand warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities.\nNevertheless,\
    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\
    \ applications. Users who use IoT\napplications must participate in its design,\
    \ improving the integration and use. In this work, different\nindustrial agricultural\
    \ facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities\n\
    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\
    \ facilities. Different decision trees to\nautomate the installation, designed\
    \ by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed\nin this document.\n\

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\
    \ SOAP, ...\nNetwork\n6LowPAN, RPL, CORPL, IPSec, TCP/UDP, DTLS\nPerception/Things\n\
    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\

    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\

    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\

    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

    diversity of Internet-connected devices raises many challenges for the traditional
    network architecture, which is not designed to support a high level of scalability,
    real-time data delivery and mobility. To address these issues, in this paper we
    present a new model of Internet of Things architecture which combines benefits
    of two emerging technologies: software-defined networking and Fog computing. Software-defined
    networking implies a logically centralized network control plane, which allows
    implementation of sophisticated mechanisms for traffic control and resource management.
    On the other hand, Fog computing enables some data to be analysed and managed
    at the network edge, thus providing support for applications that require very
    low and predictable latency. In the paper, we give detailed insight into the system
    structure and functionality of its main components. We also discuss the benefits
    of the proposed architecture and its potential services. Similar content being

    Fog Computing Paradigm for Internet of Things: Architectures, Issues, Challenges,
    and Applications Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Advances in wireless communications
    and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have enabled the rapid evolution of
    smart devices connected to the Internet. This evolution inspired the idea about
    the Internet of Things (IoT)—a large-scale cognitive system in which wide variety
    of “things” could contribute. The definition of “thing” is very flexible, and
    may refer to: intelligent machines, drones, self-driving cars, sensor nodes measuring
    parameters such as temperature and humidity, actuators that turn on and off devices
    or make adjustments in real time, and much more. Thus, the exponential increase
    in the volume and variety of data is expected, creating a significant burden for
    the Internet architecture [1]. Adding more resources to provide enough capacity
    cannot be economically justified in the long-run. The major scale issue is not
    the volume of traffic, but the type and cadence of data delivery. IoT devices
    are often configured to send regular updates throughout the day, which may cause
    a tsunami of connections and data at periodic intervals. Regular surges of traffic
    may surpass baseline or average traffic by a significant multiple of existing
    traffic patterns, so high level of resource over-provisioning could be required
    for stable operation. To avoid this, service providers need mechanisms that can
    satisfy the bandwidth demand of IoT applications by efficiently utilizing the
    existing infrastructure. That is hard to achieve with distributed control plane
    in traditional network architectures, since a global view of the network state
    is lacking. Another challenge is low-latency handling of time-critical tasks such
    as analysis and decision-making. For example, network latency could badly affect
    traffic management application which requires real-time detection of the congested
    sites. On the other hand, emerging augmented reality applications (e.g. Google
    Glass, Sony SmartEyeGlass and Microsoft HoloLens) have to process real-time video,
    voice and sensor measurements in order to finally output informational content
    on displays [2]. Without almost deterministic response time utility, adoption
    of this technology is questionable. In general, because of a loosely controlled
    nature of the Internet many QoS (Quality of Service) issues are still unresolved.
    In this paper, we propose the use of SDN (Software Defined Networking [3]) to
    alleviate resource contentions in IoT environment and improve overall IoT performance.
    SDN is a relatively new paradigm for communication networks, that implies separation
    of the forwarding and the control functions. Network intelligence is moved to
    logically centralized SDN controller, which maintains a global view of the network,
    interacts with data-plane devices and provides a programming interface for network
    management applications. The potential of this concept reflects in the fact that
    traffic engineering and resource management can be performed more efficiently
    in centralized system having insight into applications’ requirements and all resources
    available. To address the applications that require mobility support and low-delay,
    the proposed IoT architecture integrates SDN with Fog computing [4]. Although
    the benefits of the both technologies have been widely recognized within the research
    community, there are still many challenges that hinder widespread acceptance of
    them. Therefore, this paper targets to explain how SDN and Fog computing could
    be efficiently combined together to compensate each other deficiencies. In particular,
    the proposed IoT architecture aims to solve the problem of Fog orchestration with
    SDN, as well as scalability issues of SDN with Fog computing. The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides brief background on traditional
    IoT architecture and related challenges. Section 3 introduces the basic ideas
    of SDN and Fog computing and then describes the components and operation model
    of the proposed architecture. A few use cases that would especially benefit from
    the proposed architecture are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes the paper.
    2 IoT: Current State and Challenges The IoT paradigm is based on various kinds
    of smart devices with communication and networking capabilities, embedded in the
    environment around us. According to CISCO forecasts the number of Internet-connected
    devices overtook the human population in 2010, and will be about 50 billion by
    2020 [5]. Although these devices mostly have low bandwidth demands, the overall
    result is enormous amount of data which have to be stored, processed and presented
    in a seamless, efficient, and easily interpretable form [6]. Figure 1 illustrates
    the common organization of today’s IoT architecture from a high level perspective.
    Four main components involved are: sensing devices (things), the local communication
    network, the Internet Cloud and back-end IoT applications. Sensing devices gather
    data from the physical environment. These data are later used by IoT applications
    (e.g. smart transportation, healthcare, precision agriculture, video surveillance,
    etc.) to provide a desirable service to end customers. Since IoT devices are in
    general characterized by very limited memory and computational resources, IoT
    application usually takes advantage of services offered by the Cloud for data
    storage and processing. To reach the Cloud, sensing devices rely on different
    communication technologies. Those more powerful connect directly to cellular network
    (3G or 4G), or use Wi-Fi/Ethernet connectivity to the Internet gateway. However,
    these communication models require a fair amount of power that myriad devices
    cannot afford (e.g. battery operated devices). For the short range communication
    between energy-deficient devices, some other options are more convenient, such
    as Bluetooth, ZigBee or NFC (Near-Field Communication). Once the raw data generated
    by one or more sensing sources are appropriately processed in the Cloud, the useful
    information are finally delivered to the end user. That may be commercial or an
    industrial user, or another device in M2M (Machine-to-Machine) workflow. Fig.
    1 Traditional IoT architecture Full size image Cloud offers scalable and cost
    effective solution to deal with data produced by IoT. Its virtually unlimited
    resources compensate technological limitation of IoT devices (e.g. storage, processing
    and energy) and enable analysis of unprecedented complexity [7]. Also, “pay-as-you-go”
    Cloud computing model is a more convenient alternative to owning and managing
    private data centres (DCs) if consider deployment and operational expenditures.
    However, existing Cloud services are originally designed for classic Web applications,
    which are not significantly affected by the distance between the edge devices
    and DCs. On the other side, many emerging IoT applications require real-time interaction
    and mobility support (e.g. smart traffic lights and target tracking systems),
    which makes network latency an important limiting factor. Latency introduced in
    the network is not only a consequence of long distance between IoT devices and
    the Cloud. It is also caused by queuing delay, which is non-negligible on the
    congested links. The impact of queuing delay could be reduced if traffic load
    is evenly distributed over the network. Unfortunately, dynamic routing is considered
    rather risky than beneficial in existing Internet architecture characterized by
    the distributed control plane [8]. Moreover, the simple shortest path routing
    model is still dominantly deployed. Dedicated mechanisms for connectivity control
    are also lacking. This must be resolved in order to fully exploit the opportunities
    offered by heterogeneous access networks in IoT environments. 3 SDN-Based Model
    of IoT System In order to address previously discussed challenges, in this Section
    we propose a new model of IoT architecture based on two emerging technologies:
    SDN and Fog computing. We will briefly present basic ideas of these networking
    paradigms, and then explain how they are combined together and envisioned to operate
    in the proposed system model. 3.1 Software Defined Networking In traditional telecommunications
    networks the control and the data plane are implemented in each networking device.
    The control plane carries signalling traffic, performs route calculation, system
    configuration and management. It contains all the logic that controls the behaviour
    of the network. On the other hand, the data plane is focused only on the transport
    of packets towards their next destination. The network itself basically could
    be seen as a distributed entity that connects diverse independent and autonomous
    devices. Network management is done at very low level, and once forwarding policy
    is defined, the only way to make an adjustment to the policy is via manual configuration
    of the devices. This limits ability to introduce new services in the network or
    to adapt the network behaviour to varying application requirements and load condition
    [9, 10]. Novelty introduced with SDN is clear separation of the control and the
    data plane. SDN control plane is placed on a logically centralized controller,
    which maintains a global view of the network, interacts with simple forwarding
    devices and provides a programming interface for network management applications
    (Fig. 2). In this way, SDN allows network managers to configure and optimize network
    resources dynamically via automated programs [3]. The communication between SDN
    controller and the data plane devices is commonly achieved via OpenFlow protocol
    [11]. The controller pro-actively or reactively instructs the data plane devices
    (OpenFlow switches) how to identify and treat different traffic flows in the network.
    When OpenFlow switch receives the instructions for specific traffic flow, it is
    able to handle packets belonging to the flow without further interaction with
    the controller until validation time for the instructions expires. Note that SDN/OpenFlow
    architecture described above is originally designed for DC and WAN (Wide Area
    Network) networks. However, the need for similar technology in 5G mobile networks
    has been widely recognized by the research communities [9, 12, 13]. Fig. 2 SDN
    architecture Full size image 3.2 Fog Computing Fog computing is an emerging technology
    that brings data processing, storage and analytics closer to the network edge.
    It has many mechanisms and attributes in common with Cloud computing, however,
    Fog can be distinguished from Cloud by its proximity to end-users, the dense geographical
    distribution and its support for mobility [4]. Figure 3 illustrates the position
    of Fog computing in IoT systems. It is obvious that Fog cannot substitute the
    Cloud, but complements its services by introducing a new intermediate layer composed
    of geo-distributed Fog nodes. Each Fog node is highly virtualized platform hosted
    on dedicated computing node equipped with communication interface, or resource-poorer
    device such as set-top box, access point, router, switch, etc. Data collected
    by IoT sensing devices are not send directly to the Cloud server for processing.
    Instead, they are sent to nearby Fog node in order to obtain fast and high-rate
    service. However, Fog node can filter out non-actionable data (e.g. regular sensor
    measurements) and send them to the Cloud for long-term storage and batch analytics.
    The Cloud is a natural place to run global analytics on data collected from widely
    distributed devices over long periods (months, years) [1, 14]. Fig. 3 The role
    of Fog layer in IoT architecture Full size image Fog computing does not only enhance
    QoS (Quality of Service) for a large number of IoT applications, but also may
    significantly reduce bandwidth consumption in the backbone network. Consequently,
    the users could be benefited from the reduced service costs [15]. This vision
    has been recently made possible by Cisco IOx platform, which combines open-source
    Linux and Cisco IOS network operating system together in a single networked device
    (router, switch or IP camera). Linux transforms the underlying device to mini-computer
    that can host third party applications on virtual containers and analyse data
    locally in real time [16]. 3.3 The Proposed System Design This section describes
    a model of IoT architecture which takes advantage of SDN and Fog computing paradigms.
    The proposed solution is inspired by recent works on these topics [1, 17–20].
    However, while each of them is either focused only on one of the technologies
    or considers their application in VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork) networks, we
    analyse the generic IoT scenario where features of both technologies are combined
    together in one integrated system. Figure 4 shows the system structure which involves:
    end devices with multiple wireless communication solutions, SDN controllers, heterogeneous
    Fog infrastructure (virtualized servers, routers, access points, etc.) and Cloud
    in the network core. Since IoT applications may be geospatially distributed, we
    assumed hierarchical deployment of Fog network. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, Fog
    nodes expose a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for application
    deployment and development, resource management and control. These APIs allow
    seamless access to hypervisors, various operating systems and service containers
    on a physical machine [1]. Also, they enable remote monitoring and management
    of physical resources such as CPU, memory and network interfaces. Development
    of IoT applications using hierarchically deployed and heterogeneous Fog resources
    could be simplified by adopting Mobile Fog programming model [20]. Mobile Fog
    runs the same application code on various devices of the heterogeneous Fog infrastructure.
    The application consists of multiple processes that perform different tasks with
    respect to the device capabilities and position in the network hierarchy. For
    example, tasks of large-scale video surveillance application may be organized
    in three levels: motion detection at IP camera, face recognition at edge Fog nodes
    and aggregation of identities at Cloud server [20]. It is assumed that each of
    the devices has information about its geophysical location. Thus, although all
    of them run the same code, each one is aware of its particular tasks. Fig. 4 SDN
    architecture for IoT based on Fog computing Full size image A major challenge
    imposed by Fog concept refers to service orchestration. The orchestration involves
    automated instantiation, replication and migration of service instances on a large
    volume of Fog nodes with a wide range of capabilities. As discussed earlier, many
    IoT applications deal with dynamic workload due to periodic or event-driven data
    delivery models. In an ideal case, applications should be transparently scaled
    at the runtime without resource over-provisioning. In order to achieve that, we
    propose logical centralization of orchestration functionality at SDN controller.
    The design of SDN controller is modified compared to traditional one used in DC
    networks. As illustrated in Figure 5b, its role in IoT system is threefold: 1.
    Fog orchestration. 2. Injection of routing logic into SDN-enabled network elements.
    3. Optimal selection of access points for IoT devices (i.e. radio access network
    management). Fig. 5 Structure of the Fog node (a), SDN controller (b) and wireless
    end device [19] (c) in the proposed architecture Full size image To perform above
    tasks efficiently the controller needs an up-to-date view of the system. For this
    reason, it collects and maintains information about: Features of Fog nodes in
    the controlled domain, such as: available RAM, secondary storage, running Operating
    Systems and software applications [1]. Capabilities, state and interconnectivity
    of the network elements, including: wireless technology of the access points (e.g.
    3G/4G, LTE, Wi-Fi etc.), links capacity and residual bandwidth, the flow table
    content and neighbour list of each network node. Characteristics of the connected
    smart devices, such as: supported radio access technologies and types of services
    the devices are requesting. In order to obtain up-to-date information about topology
    of the ad-hoc connected devices, link layer mechanism in each device could be
    used to periodically broadcast beacon messages for learning neighbour’s information.
    Beside neighbour lists, for the purpose of high-mobile vehicular applications,
    the controller may also store road map of the environment and information regarding
    the position and speed of the vehicles involved [19]. The Fog orchestration is
    performed according to business polices defined by application service providers.
    For example, the policies may specify: requirements in terms of computing and
    memory resources, requirements in term of bandwidth and delay for different classes
    of subscribers, thresholds for load balancing, privacy rules etc. [1]. These policies
    are stored in SDN controllers and the Fog nodes hosting the provider’s application.
    The end-device connects to application process running on the Fog computing instance
    that covers the location of the end-device. If the end-device is mobile and enters
    the new region, it will connect to the new Fog node that runs the same application
    process on the same level of network hierarchy as the previous one. SDN controller
    provides dynamic, policy-based management of Fog services. It can track the moving
    devices and predict their potential destinations in the near future. This enables
    seamless handover to a new Fog node at the network edge. Also, there is a possibility
    that the Fog computing instance located in the new region cannot meet QoS requirements
    of the end-user. In that case, new computing instance needs to be instantiated
    on a platform with the matching capabilities. Procedure of creating a new computing
    instance is far from trivial, because it requires: resource reservation, copying
    of application data, setting-up the instance configuration and dissemination of
    the new flow rules in the network. Therefore, the role of SDN controller is crucial
    to timely detect and react to threat of policy violation based on the up-to-date
    view of the system state. High workload can also trigger dynamic scaling of the
    application if that is specified in the business policy. For example, when a load
    balancing threshold in terms of maximum number of users, connections or CPU load
    is reached, new on-demand Fog instances could be created. To distribute the workload
    over them, SDN controller splits the coverage region of the overloaded application
    process in multiple smaller sub-regions. The number of sub-regions corresponds
    to the number of newly created Fog instances of the same process. Similarly, when
    these nearby processes at the same network hierarchy level become under loaded,
    their coverage regions are merged together into a single coverage area, and all
    the processes except one for the merged coverage are terminated [20]. Beside Fog
    orchestration, SDN controller performs traffic control as OpenFlow controller
    and connectivity management for IoT devices. Since IoT application in large-scale
    network environments (e.g. smart city applications) generate enormous amounts
    of data flows, the SDN control plane needs to be partitioned among multiple physical
    controllers to avoid scalability and reliability implications. As can be seen
    from Fig. 5, single SDN controller covers region with multiple Fog nodes because
    it is placed on a higher level of network hierarchy. The network partitions are
    interconnected by OpenFlow switches to enable exchange of data between controllers.
    This is necessary for scheduling traffic flows between IoT devices located in
    different partitions. For robustness reasons, we assumed that some control tasks
    may be delegated to local SDN agents running on Fog nodes and SDN-enabled IoT
    devices, as proposed in [18]. For example, Fog nodes at the network edge may control
    IoT device to IoT device multi-hop wireless communication in their coverage region
    based on their local knowledge and policy rules obtained from the controller.
    On the other side, the controller calculates the other routes in the system, such
    as inter-region routes and routes towards the other autonomous systems for data
    intended for the Cloud. Note that support for time-critical IoT tasks requires
    flow rules installed in advance, which reduces controller’s efficiency in resource
    allocation. However, granular traffic control offered by OpenFlow can be exploited
    to separate emergency traffic and delay-insensitive traffic. Therefore, the first
    class could be scheduled always with the highest priority over the proactively
    installed routes, while the route calculation and resource reservation for the
    other traffic class could be done in a reactive manner. The edge Fog nodes are
    envisioned to regularly inform the SDN controller about the capabilities and position
    of IoT devices that are being served. In this way, controller can build an entire
    connectivity graph and periodically run optimization algorithms to provide better
    utilization of network resources and enhance QoS. For example, if SDN controller
    discovers that the network load had become unbalanced because proactive routing
    results in traffic focusing on some selected nodes, it can start a rerouting process
    to improve network utility and reduce congestion. In addition to routing optimization,
    the controller is supposed to perform connectivity management on the time-window
    basis. Algorithm for optimal access point selection in multi-network IoT environment
    has been proposed in [22]. Such an algorithm can be implemented on SDN controller
    to perform access point assignment for set of newly joined devices based on: the
    current multi-network capacity in the controlled partition, the supported radio
    access technologies and the types of services the devices are requesting. The
    assignment process is triggered at the end of each time-window, and aims to find
    a set of access points that can satisfy bandwidth requirements of the IoT devices
    and guarantee optimal system performance. If the algorithm outputs the assignment
    configuration different than the existing one, SDN controller starts the suggested
    handover procedures between the heterogeneous access networks. An architecture
    of SDN-enabled sensor node is shown in Fig. 5c. Main component introduced in the
    architecture is a software OpenFlow switch. Application traffic always goes through
    this component before being sent, which allows the control plane elements (i.e.
    Fog nodes at the edge and SDN controllers) to identify the access of traffic flows
    into the network [19]. The number of wireless interfaces on the sensor node depends
    on services for which node is intended. Note that we considered only IP addressed
    sensor nodes as the elements of SDN data-plane. However, there are other solutions
    for implementing SDN in WSN networks as well [23, 24]. Beside SDN module, each
    sensor node runs a daemon process which implements some of the traditional ad-hoc
    routing protocols (e.g. AODV—Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector [25]). Both, the
    SDN control entity and the AODV daemon, have access to the node’s flow table.
    AODV process is activated when no route to the SDN control entity is known. That
    is the case when sensor node joins the network or when control communication is
    lost due to bad conditions on the wireless channel. 4 Use-Cases Rapid evolution
    of the IoT brings a number of use cases of interest that could benefit from the
    concepts of SDN and Fog computing. In this Section we chose some of them to illustrate
    the potential of the proposed system architecture. 4.1 Smart Transportation Smart
    transportation represents one of the markets of the primary importance for IoT.
    The rationale for the adoption of IoT in this field are several, from social to
    economic. Some common services refer to traffic management, safety and infotainment.
    Traffic management services analyse traffic behaviour and events in order to optimize
    overall road capacity, reduce travel time and minimize the ecological footprint
    by smartly routing vehicles and coordinating traffic lights. Safety services aim
    to reduce accidents for pedestrians and vehicle occupants. The infotainment services
    are focused on providing classic IP informative and entertaining applications
    like Web browsing, video streaming, e-mail and social networks [20]. Different
    classes of transportation services often use the same data sources (e.g. sensors
    on the roads, traffic cameras, passing vehicles and so on) and networking infrastructure.
    However, importance of each service is not the same for the end user. Therefore,
    when the network is congested traffic flows should not be treated in the same
    manner. Without mechanisms for service differentiation and ability to provide
    real-time delivery today’s IoT architecture limits efficiency of the existing
    services and hinders implementation of new ones. On the other side, with SDN and
    Fog computing both of the mentioned requirements could be met. We will elaborate
    this on the example of STL (Smart Traffic Light) system. STL systems use a large
    number of distributed sensors to measure distance, speed and direction of vehicles
    and detect the presence of pedestrian and cyclist crossing the street. Collected
    sensor measurements are mainly used for three purposes: (a) accident prevention;
    (b) detection and offloading of congested sites; (c) long-term analysis of the
    system efficiency. These three tasks are significantly different in terms of delay-sensitivity.
    The last one can tolerate delays in data delivery, while the first two require
    immediate or near real-time reaction. If all the measurement data are sent to
    the Cloud for processing, support for real-time services is very questionable.
    When STL application detects risk of vehicle collision with pedestrians and cyclist,
    to be effective, the control system has to send notification to the approaching
    vehicles within milliseconds [1]. The need for fast decision making at the network
    edge (i.e. Fog computing) is strongly emphasized in this scenario, and has been
    discussed in detail in [1]. Beside Fog computing, the presented system model can
    also exploit benefits of SDN to dynamically assign higher priority to some traffic
    flows in emergency situations, and hence guarantee low-latency. Fig. 6 Use-case
    of smart transportation Full size image Support for real-time decision-making
    provided by Fog computing could bring autonomous cars soon in reality. Tesla Motors
    and Google are investing a lot of efforts in developing a software that will allow
    “hands free” operation of the car [26]. These cars will not require human involvement
    in control of the primary driving features such as brakes, acceleration and steering.
    With Fog infrastructure at the network edge, the cars and sensing devices deployed
    along the road will be able to interact in real-time [17]. When it comes to delivery
    of infotainment services in VANET networks, it could be greatly enhanced with
    SDN technology. The most popular infotainment applications include various forms
    of audio/video streaming. Delivery of this kind of data is very challenging not
    only due to strict delay requirements, but also due to high level of mobility
    and topology fluctuations [19]. Based on road map and detailed information about
    the vehicle position, speed and moving direction, SDN controller can make timely
    decisions about deployment of new service instances at the Fog nodes. In this
    way, impact of mobility on application performance could be minimized. On the
    other hand, the proposed system architecture can help in reducing duplication
    of the streaming traffic. For example if blue and red car in Fig. 6 are requesting
    the same data stream, SDN controller has enough knowledge to make optimal routing
    decision, i.e. to use only one traffic flow from the streaming server to the red
    car, and then to serve blue car from the red car. 4.2 Video Surveillance Video
    surveillance is an important component of smart cities. Largely-distributed cameras
    in a city or along the road bring security services on a higher level, providing
    strong sense of assurance to the public. There are two advantages of using the
    proposed IoT architecture for video surveillance. The first is that SDN controller
    can make resource allocation and routing decisions based on QoS requirements.
    Thus, it will always seek for routes that can meet bandwidth requirements of video
    flows. The second advantage is that local, resource rich Fog nodes, can provide
    real-time processing of video frames and send notification to end-user when some
    event is detected. This significantly reduces bandwidth consumption in the network,
    while increases application efficiency (e.g. detection of criminal activity).
    In [21], authors proposed the hierarchical design of Fog application for vehicle
    tracking. Their application is organized in three processes which take place at
    different levels of the network hierarchy. IP camera runs the first process. If
    the camera is capable to perform motion detection, it will not send the video
    to the parent Fog node unless motion is detected. The parent Fog node is placed
    at higher level of network hierarchy, and hence have much wider scope. It runs
    process that identifies vehicles in the video scenes and detects their position
    and licence plates. If a police had issued a search for the detected vehicle,
    information about vehicle location is recorded into database and notification
    is sent to application process at the highest level of hierarchy. However, if
    the video image is not clear enough to enable detection of the licence plate number,
    the Fog node may send pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) command to camera. Interaction with
    PTZ module requires very low latency, which cannot be provided if video processing
    is done at remote Cloud server. 4.3 Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture
    takes advantage of advanced information and communication technologies to address
    today’s agricultural issues such as the need to balance productivity with environmental
    concerns. The applications of this scenario are facilitated by ad-hoc wireless
    sensors and actuator networks (WSANs), deployed to measure/monitor specific parameters
    of the environment and enforce control decisions. The data obtained from sensor
    nodes are used by the Cloud application to make intelligent control decisions
    that should yield better and more crops through optimal application of water,
    pesticides and fertilizers. With Fog node deployed at the network edge, the local
    application instance can process the collected data, control the measurement process
    itself, the stability and the oscillatory behaviors and issue commands to actuators
    (e.g. to irrigation valves) in real-time. The Fog application can also decide
    to reject packets carrying redundant information, and send the aggregated data
    to the Cloud for long-term analysis. Local SDN controller could be run as one
    of the application on the Fog node. This application would be responsible for
    automatic configuring of WSN and optimal management of energy constrained sensor
    nodes with limited communications abilities [27]. Need for processing at the network
    edge has been more pronounced with the recent emergence of UAVs (Unmanned aerial
    vehicles) at farm market. So far, UAVs has been mostly used in agriculture to
    collect sensor data, scan plants for health problems, and locate disease out brakes.
    These information are than used by farmers to provide only the needed pesticide
    or nutrient to each plant. However, modern trends go towards multi-UAV deployment.
    Beside UAVs that perform monitoring of the crops, special types of UAVs are designed
    that can apply pesticides with very high accuracy according to spraying logistic
    [28]. Multiple simultaneously operating UAVs impose the need for centralized coordination
    of the individual tasks. In the proposed IoT architecture Fog node could play
    role of Internet gateway and UAV coordinator in the same time. It could process
    various types of multimedia and scalar data collected by UAVs, recommend optimal
    crop treatment and send control commands to aerial (UAVs robots) and ground actuators.
    5 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed the architecture for IoT, which relies
    on two emerging technologies: SDN and Fog computing. The proposed architecture
    is designed in the way to support a high level of scalability, real-time data
    delivery and mobility. Fog computing platform is considered as the appropriate
    platform for IoT due to its capability to resolve problems related to latency
    for services that require fast analysis and decision-making. On the other hand,
    SDN introduces logically centralized control plane, which allows the implementation
    of sophisticated mechanisms for traffic control and resource management. Such
    a network design could be of vital importance to address increasing capacity demands
    in IoT environments where an enormous number of Internet-connected devices is
    expected. While the mentioned benefits have been widely recognized by the research
    community, this paper discusses the main challenges that hinder widespread adoption
    of each of the two technologies individually. The proposed IoT architecture addresses
    these challenges by combining SDN and Fog computing together in one system and
    adapting them to each other. In particular, the functionality of Fog orchestration
    is delegated to SDN controller in order to achieve higher efficiency, while SDN
    scalability issue is relaxed by delegating some controller’s tasks to Fog nodes.
    Benefits of using our proposed architecture have been illustrated by several use-cases
    that range from theoretical visions to existing services. Plan for future work
    is to design centralized control logic for orchestration of Fog services and to
    evaluate performance of the proposed solution in the appropriate simulation environment.

    \ a high-performance,\nhigh-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies\
    \ the introduction of new technologies\ninto monitoring activities related to\
    \ control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents\na hierarchical\

    \ methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT\n\

    \ agriculture.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor networks;\

    The need for high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture\
    \ results from the\nrapid growth of the human population. This requires permanent\
    \ monitoring and intelligent processing\nof the measured data collected from the\
    \ ﬁeld, correlated with the weather forecasts, to produce\nagronomic recommendations.\
    \ In the last few years, new technologies in agriculture, and especially in\n\
    precision agriculture (PA), have been leveraged for increased productivity and\
    \ eﬃcient input dosage [1].\nMost importantly, in PA, farmers need to know exact\
    \ and timely details about crop status. These details\nabout certain parameters,\
    \ obtained by measurements both from the ground and in the air, constitute\ninput\
    \ data to specialized systems of process management in the PA. Some relevant examples\
    \ might\ninclude for example, irrigation control, pesticide dosage, pest control,\
    \ etc. For acquisition and complex\nprocessing of the collected data, integration\
    \ of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) under\
    \ novel frameworks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), has been shown to\n\
    contribute to increases in agricultural yields [2]. Such advanced systems are\
    \ modeled as well-speciﬁed\nSensors 2020, 20, 817; doi:10.3390/s20030817\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 817\n2 of 25\nagent-based solutions with sensors and UAVs. Although\
    \ the contributions of UAVs and WSNs, taken\nseparately, are well documented and\
    \ important in the sustainable growth of agricultural production,\nthe integration\
    \ of these components together within an IoT framework is expected to signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the solutions for monitoring, production modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n\
    Relevant applications of UAV–WSN systems are presented in Reference [3–6]. In\
    \ viticulture,\nas a special type of PA, the soil and air parameters modify grape\
    \ yield and quality. For this purpose,\na solution based on the collaborative\
    \ system mini UAV (quadrotor type)–WSNs to monitor parameters,\nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, to prevent the frost in fragmented vineyards is proposed in Reference\
    \ [3].\nThe UAV is considered as communication relay between sensors and a base\
    \ station. A real application\nfor monitoring sensitive parameters in vineyards\
    \ with both agro-meteorological stations and UAV\nplatforms is presented in Reference\
    \ [4]. In order to obtain a precise monitoring of the speciﬁc indicators,\nthe\
    \ data from the ground are correlated with the data collected by a UAV platform\
    \ with 8 rotors\nprovided with a professional thermal camera. The study was conducted\
    \ over a period of two years.\nFor data acquisition on large areas, a ﬁxed wing\
    \ type UAV, used as data mule from the ground WSN,\nis proposed in Reference [5].\
    \ In addition, the UAV has attached an high deﬁnition (HD) camera for the\ndetection\
    \ of certain plant diseases. Experimentally, a small tank has been added to spray\
    \ diﬀerent\ninsecticides, fertilizers, herbicides, etc. Both UAV and WSN are low\
    \ cost and not robust for only\ndemonstration purposes. In addition, in Reference\
    \ [6], a low cost agro-meteorological monitoring\nsystem in a vineyard was designed\
    \ and developed. The optimal positioning of the sensors was made\nwith the help\
    \ of the multispectral image analysis, acquired by UAV.\nGiven recent evolutions\
    \ in UAV technologies, cost reduction, and new regulations of aviation\nauthorities\
    \ regarding the usage and deployment of such systems (e.g., European Aviation\
    \ Safety\nAgency (EASA) [7] and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [8]), such\
    \ aerial robotic platforms\nare increasingly used in agriculture for diﬀerent\
    \ tasks, the most important being crop monitoring [9].\nAccording to EASA, the\
    \ UAVs should be safely integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate\
    \ way [7]. For large scale applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond line-of-sight,\n\
    compliance with strict regulatory frameworks is essential.\nAdoption of a UAV-based\
    \ solution for image acquisition in agriculture applications is more\ncost eﬀective\
    \ and ﬂexible in comparison with satellite or manned aircraft alternatives [10].\
    \ Both\nﬁxed- wing [11,12] and rotary-wing type [3,13] UAVs are frequently used\
    \ in various applications in\nagriculture, while accounting for the risk of crashes\
    \ [9] and potential damages. Equipped with speciﬁc\nsensors in modular payloads\
    \ [14], such as high resolution RGB [15], infrared, multispectral [16,17],\nthermal\
    \ cameras [18,19], and also LIDAR [10], UAVs are able to create precise maps of\
    \ crop state or\nevolution [17], health plant assessment [20], diseases [21],\
    \ soil characteristics, evaluate losses caused\nby ﬂoods [11], etc. In the crop\
    \ monitoring, the following characteristics are analyzed from UAV\nimages [9]:\
    \ the crop water stress, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the canopy and the air\
    \ temperature,\nthe photochemical reﬂectance index, and the vegetation indices.\n\
    Although UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are now available, most applications\
    \ in PA\nuse UAVs driven by electric motors due to their compact size, reduced\
    \ maintenance and operational\ncosts and, not the least, their alignment with\
    \ the current regulatory context and tendencies towards the\nreduction of global\
    \ carbon emissions [22].\nThe small-scale data acquisition by the WSN helps farmers\
    \ to take actions like crop irrigation,\nfertilizer usages, deciding on the optimum\
    \ stages of sowing, and harvesting [23]. Moreover, WSNs\nemployed in PA lead to\
    \ large amounts of data. Thus, data collection by WSNs is an important\ncontribution\
    \ to the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) [24,25].\n\
    The WSN has multiple functions at the ﬁeld level: data acquisition of various\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., temperature in soil and air, humidity in soil and air, solar\
    \ radiance, soil nutrients, the presence of\npests and weeds, chlorophyll content\
    \ in plants, etc.), distributed processing of data by establishing\nconsensus—if\
    \ it is the case, establishing the relevant data and its storage, low level data\
    \ fusion, and\ndata transmission. New sensor node designs oﬀer reduced costs [26];\
    \ see, for example, the detailed list\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n3 of 25\nof sensors\
    \ used in PA given in Reference [10]. As in many other large-area monitoring applications,\n\
    for communication or local processing reasons, the sensors are grouped into sensor\
    \ networks, the\ncommunication being made by radio. A WSN network will include\
    \ measurement nodes (sensory\nnodes) and data collection, processing, and transmission\
    \ nodes (sink or cluster head).\nRegarding PA, there is no rigorous theory of\
    \ sensor placement because it depends on the\nparticularities of the soil and\
    \ the weather. Sensor groups need to comply broadly with the need for\nsensory\
    \ and communication coverage. In Reference [27], two examples of sensor location\
    \ topologies\nare given: grid and random. From the point of view of communication\
    \ with the sink node, the most\nused are the star and mesh topologies. The wireless\
    \ communication protocols used in WSN for PA are\nthe following [10]: 6LoWPAN,\
    \ ZigBee (both being the most suitable for the mesh topology), LoRaWAN,\nGSM,\
    \ BLE, and Wi-Fi.\nIn PA, WSNs are used, most often, for parameter monitoring,\
    \ but they can also be integrated into\ncontrol systems as sensors. Direct speciﬁc\
    \ applications of WSN in control systems for PA are the energy\neﬃcient automated\
    \ control of irrigation [28] and smart automated fertilization [29].\nThe performance\
    \ of the crop monitoring can be improved by UAV–WSN collaboration [30].\nThe collaborative\
    \ aspects in an integrated UAV (aerial agents)–WSN (ground agents) architecture\
    \ for\ndiﬀerent applications was recently presented in a review paper [22], where\
    \ the diﬀerent functional\ncomponents of the system and how they collaborate with\
    \ each other was highlighted. In Reference [31],\nthe authors presented an integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN–IoT system, named FarmBeats, which is an end-to-end\nplatform for data\
    \ collection from various sensors, cameras, and drones in agricultural applications.\n\
    An unlicensed TV White Spaces is used to setup a high bandwidth link from the\
    \ farmer’s home to an\nIoT ground station at a distance for collecting data from\
    \ UAVs and WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect the UAVs and terrestrial WSNs into\
    \ hybrid networks and, at the same\ntime, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with\
    \ aircrafts, multiple organizations are contributing [22]:\nInternational Civil\
    \ Aviation Organization, EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned\n\
    Systems, International Telecommunications Union, etc. Satellite connection is\
    \ required for two reasons.\nOne-way communication, such as obtaining the GPS\
    \ location of the UAVs or the sensory nodes (if any)\nis one reason. The second\
    \ reason is a possible data transmission or remote control (via two-way\nsatellite-intermediated\
    \ internet).\nIn Reference [32], the authors discuss the information system design\
    \ supporting agriculture\ndata management. Enabling advanced data processing in\
    \ the form of sensor fusion and clustering\nmechanisms for improved network topologies\
    \ in generic applications has been discussed [30]. Eﬀective\ndata gathering mechanisms\
    \ [33] and higher level IoT architectures [34] are key and current topics\nof\
    \ interest.\nWe believe that the challenges of UAV–WSN–IoT integrated systems\
    \ can come from several\ndirections: (a) precise localization of the ground sensors\
    \ with the aid of a preliminary ﬂight; (b) sensor\nstates periodically inspected\
    \ by UAV; (c) establishing of the WSNs as sensor clusters able to cover, both\n\
    from the sensorial and from the communication point of view the monitored area;\
    \ (d) establishing\nthe cluster heads (CH), named base stations, of the WSNs able\
    \ to communicate data to UAVs;\n(e) transmitting commands to change the strategy\
    \ and parameters of the sensor networks, (f) data\nacquisition from WSNs through\
    \ UAVs, (g) special trajectory planning and tracking, (h) the aggregation\nof\
    \ information collected by the UAV with the information collected by WSN for the\
    \ purpose of\nmeasuring and interpreting the parameters with increased accuracy,\
    \ (i) remote control via Internet,\nand (j) edge and cloud computing.\nIn a hierarchical\
    \ structure, the data processing architecture of the integrated system is based\
    \ on\nthree levels: consensus, edge computing [35], and cloud computing.\nFor\
    \ the main activity, the data collection from CH, UAV must have a predeﬁned trajectory,\
    \ properly\ndesigned, and accounting for the following limitations:\n•\nWaypoint\
    \ passing: a UAV has to pass above the CH to extract the relevant data from that\
    \ area\n(covered by the corresponding WSN sub-network);\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\
    4 of 25\n•\nObstacle avoidance: UAVs avoid obstructions or prohibited areas along\
    \ the ﬂight plan;\n•\nGuaranteed communication: to ensure that the data has been\
    \ fully collected, enough time has to\nbe spent in the CH neighborhood;\n•\nEﬃciency:\
    \ reduce at a minimum the energy consumption for that trajectory (consider the\
    \ length\nof the trajectory and its complexity).\nThe integration of UAV–WSN based\
    \ systems for PA in IoT is a mandatory step to create an\nadvanced FMIS [25].\n\
    Due to the integration, the system can become “smart” by using elements of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence\nlike self-adaptation and decision, optimal trajectory, data transmission\
    \ of relevant parameter values,\nenergy eﬃciency, and neural networks for data\
    \ and image processing. Not in the least, the sensors must\nbe placed optimally,\
    \ considering the terrain characteristics. Battery life is an important design\
    \ point\nof the ground sensor algorithms by reducing to a minimum the number of\
    \ wireless communications\nneeded to transfer the information. The radio interface\
    \ is the critical factor in increasing battery life.\nBased on the frequency of\
    \ the data collection and radio transmissions the nodes can have a battery\nlifetime\
    \ ranging from several months up to one year. Therefore, the intelligent collaboration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN can lead to optimization of parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption, sensing coverage,\nrisk, data acquisition, and processing time\
    \ [36]. To this end, bio-inspired optimization heuristics and\ngenetic algorithms\
    \ were applied to the aforementioned agents.\nThe optimal WSN coverage by the\
    \ aid of UAV platforms is implemented in Reference [37] as an\noptimization problem,\
    \ formulated by means of the travelling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the\n\
    best path of the UAV for data collection with minimum energy consumption.\nUsing\
    \ UAV as data mule for multi WSNs is an energy-eﬃcient method to increase the\
    \ networks’\nlife. To this end, the authors in Reference [38] apply the successive\
    \ convex optimization technique.\nThe proposed system presents the following integration\
    \ aspects:\n-\nGroup the sensors in clusters and determine the cluster heads,\
    \ the methodology proposed by the\nauthors in Reference [30];\n-\nPath planning\
    \ based on speciﬁc conditions for eﬃcient data collection; and\n-\nIntelligent\
    \ data collection and processing.\nThe main contributions consist in the following:\
    \ (i) implementation of a multilevel, collaborative\nUAV–WSN system structure\
    \ for agriculture applications, (ii) a speciﬁc path planning for ﬁxed\nwing–type\
    \ UAV with the purpose of robust and eﬃcient data collection, (iii) obtaining\
    \ relevant data\nfrom sensors for the purpose of saving energy, and (iv) edge–fog–cloud\
    \ computing algorithms for\nsubsequent data processing. Thus, the main challenge\
    \ is related to improving data extraction and\ncommunication in large scale heterogeneous\
    \ monitoring system. The key problem is focused on\nimproving the performance\
    \ of such systems through better algorithms and synchronization among the\ntwo\
    \ subsystems: the ground sensor network and the robotic aerial platforms, implemented\
    \ as UAVs,\nfor data collection and relaying.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 describes the concept, the methodology,\nand key aspects\
    \ that have been addressed for the proper design and implementation of the system.\n\
    Section 3 presents the experimental results and performances after implementing\
    \ the system on an\nexperimental farm. Section 4 highlights the conclusions, as\
    \ well as future work.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Requirements for Integrated\
    \ UAV-WSN-IoT Systems\nFor the design of reliable and robust large-scale monitoring\
    \ system the requirements have to\nﬁrst be validated. The main challenges for\
    \ such collaborative systems were considered to be: sensing\ncoverage in accordance\
    \ to mission objectives, communication coverage by the hybrid UAV–WSN\nsystem\
    \ using various types of radio links, from low-power, low-data rate to high throughput\
    \ long\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n5 of 25\ndistance for streaming, energy eﬃciency,\
    \ and, not in the least, computing eﬃciency. The decentralized\narchitecture for\
    \ crop ﬁeld monitoring described in this paper is designed to overcome the challenges\n\
    mentioned above and to account for the data generation patterns at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ While the proposed\ndata fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-ﬁeld\
    \ data at CH level manage to reduce data\nvolume and ensure the ﬂow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an additional intermediate level is\nappended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, we consider both\
    \ mobile agents\n(UAV) and multiple ﬁxed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ diagram is presented in Figure 1.\nThe mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, image acquisition, relay, and\nstate inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The ﬁxed agents acquire data from the ﬁeld (agricultural ﬁeld—soil and\
    \ air),\nprocess data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ ﬁnally transmit data to the UAV by\nmeans of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing levels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog\nComputing level, Internet/Cloud\
    \ Computing level, and Data Management and Interpretation level.\nThis is a multi-WSN–UAV\
    \ structure with higher level integration in internet-based systems for decision\n\
    support. The data from WSNs are collected by a UAV, transmitted at a ground control\
    \ station (GCS),\nand, from here via the internet, to the Data Interpretation\
    \ module. Analytics functionality ranges from\nbasic statistical indicators to\
    \ trend and event detectors and up to basic statistical learning models that\n\
    have the ability to anticipate evolutions in the monitored ground phenomena.\n\
    Another important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated or complementary\n\
    interpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either mobile or ﬁxed. For\
    \ example, when the soil\nmoisture is too high, the soil sensors show the maximum\
    \ value and cannot discern whether a ﬂood has\noccurred. This can be accurately\
    \ determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition, the\ndegree of\
    \ humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can be observed either\
    \ from the\nground or from the air (images), and a more precise determination\
    \ results from the fusion of the two\ndata sets.\nOther types of similar systems\
    \ were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\ntype UAVs,\
    \ which oﬀer better positioning accuracy for data collection while trading oﬀ\
    \ energy eﬃciency\nand autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation can also\
    \ be a diﬀerentiating factor with two\nmain approaches: random deployment of sensor\
    \ nodes in the area of interest, according to a minimum\nexpected sensing coverage\
    \ density, or deterministic, grid-like placement. Intermediate data processing\n\
    steps from the ﬁeld level to the decision level are commonly accepted as an important\
    \ mechanism to\nbalance network loads and improve communication latency.\nSensors\

    \ must be considered. The ﬁrst is the trajectory planning\nfor collecting data\
    \ from sensors (CHs), and it must take into account certain requirements, such\
    \ as\nthe complete and safe acquisition of data, on one hand, and minimize energy\
    \ and time consumption,\non the other hand [39].\nUnder certain reasonable assumptions\
    \ (known environment, known limitations), the UAV tasks\nreduce to computing a\
    \ trajectory which respects constraints and minimizes a cost (length, total energy\n\
    consumption, etc.), while simultaneously respecting various constraints (internal\
    \ dynamics, stall\nvelocity constraints or exogenous ones, those imposed by the\
    \ environment, such as obstacle avoidance\nand waypoint passing through).\nThe\
    \ particularity lies in the fact that many of the UAV-speciﬁc constraints are\
    \ non-convex [40],\ne.g., the variable of interest z (depending of time t) has\
    \ to stay outside some bound (e.g., outside of\nan interdicted region and/or maintain\
    \ a minimal velocity). If z(t) is the UAV position, the velocity\nrestrictions\
    \ are usually written as follows:\nv ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n.z(t)\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\
    \ ≤ v.\n(1)\nBoth bounds (lower—v and upper—v) may depend on a variety of factors.\
    \ Hard constraints are\nimposed by the UAV physics: upper bound given by the engine\
    \ characteristics and lower bound by\nthe requirement to avoid stall. Note that\
    \ this work neglects the inﬂuence of wind: velocity is usually\nmeasured against\
    \ the ground (e.g., through a GPS), but, in fact, the UAV “feels” the addition\
    \ of its own\nand of the wind velocities. This may lead to an unexpected stall\
    \ or, at least, improper behavior. Usual\ntechniques are to provide more conservative\
    \ bounds in Equation (1) and to restrict the ﬂight to normal\nweather conditions.\n\
    Waypoints are introduced, in a practical mission, because data has to be gathered\
    \ from a cluster\nnode. Thus, the question of minimum communication time arises\
    \ [41]: It is necessary to remain in a\nspeciﬁc neighborhood for a deﬁned time\
    \ interval ∆ti. To correctly describe such a constraint, we require\na tuple (ωi,\
    \ ∆ti, ri , Ri), where ωi is the corresponding cluster node position (the center\
    \ of the circle in\nFigure 2), and ri and Ri are, respectively, the minimum and\
    \ the maximum radius of the permitted\ncommunication area. Because there are perturbations\
    \ due to trajectory control errors or other causes,\nthe real trajectory is included\
    \ in a ﬂight lane (Figure 2a). The ﬂight lane was experimentally established\n\
    at 30 m, under reasonable assumptions about wind speed. The trajectory z(t) has\
    \ to stay near the\nwaypoint for a least amount of time ∆ti determined by the\
    \ quantity of data which has to be transferred:\nri ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fωi − z(t)\n\
    \f\f\f\n\f\f\f ≤ Ri, t ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti].\n(2)\ncondition (2) is often impractical\
    \ to check due to the continuous nature of z(t) and because of the\nvarying time\
    \ interval [ti, ti + ∆ti]. The usual approach is to sample the constraint and\
    \ to estimate the\npath length by assuming the bounds (1) on the velocity. To\
    \ this end, we consider:\n\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\fz\n\x10\nti\n\x11\n− ωi\n\f\f\f\f\n\
    \f\f\f\f = ri,\n(3)\nwith ti given such that ti ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti]) holds; it is\
    \ important that a waypoint is reached, not when.\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n7 of\
    \ 25\nNote that the shortest distance for a trajectory checking (4) is the straight\
    \ line shown in Figure 2a,\nwhose length is 2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni . In other words,\
    \ a suﬃcient condition for guaranteeing that the minimal\ntime ∆ti has passed\
    \ is to ensure that\n∆ti ≥\n2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni\nv\n.\n(4)\nCondition (4) provides\
    \ a lower bound for the time the UAV stays between the inner and outer\ncircles\
    \ (i.e., how much time it spends inside waypoint’s ωi communication range). Then,\
    \ inserting (3) in\na trajectory design procedure implicitly guarantees enough\
    \ communication time. This approach may\nbe insuﬃcient for a couple of reasons.\
    \ First, the desired communication time may not be known at the\ntrajectory generation\
    \ time and thus could not be compared with ∆ti. Second, the communication time\n\
    is known to be larger than ∆ti and a “tangential” pass (like the one enforced\
    \ by (3)) does not suﬃce.\nThe method (detailed below) is to enter a loitering\
    \ mode to increase arbitrarily the data-gathering\ntime [42]. Making the reasonable\
    \ assumption that the loitering rl\ni radius respects the condition\nri < rl\n\
    i < Ri, means that the UAV can orbit the waypoint ωi for an indeﬁnite period of\
    \ time [43]. From\nthe viewpoint of trajectory generation, the only relevant question\
    \ remains the places at which the\nUAV inserts/dislodges onto/from the loitering\
    \ circle. Both of these points are decided by the relative\nposition of the current\
    \ waypoint with respect to the previous and next waypoints in the sequence\n(such\
    \ as to reduce unnecessary inﬂexions in the trajectory). The switch between normal\
    \ and loitering\nmodes will be done at pre-determined points: the trajectory enters\
    \ loitering mode at a point ω−\ni and\ndislodges from it at a point ω+\ni (which\
    \ lie on the loitering circle and are from/towards the direction\nof the previous/next\
    \ waypoint). Thus, when the UAV decides to ﬁnish the communication, it will\n\
    continue to orbit the loitering circle until it reaches the dislodging point ω+\n\
    i . Here, it will switch back\nto the normal trajectory mode.\nThe inner (dotted\

    \ circle, tracking an arc of\nit, and, lastly, dislodging from the circle to re-enter\
    \ its normal mode (line tracking). The UAV could\nhave orbited the loitering circle\
    \ repeatedly and dislodged from it at ω+\ni when desired. As is mentioned\nabove,\
    \ the trajectory describes a corridor (we account for the inherent tracking error\
    \ appearing under\nrealistic conditions).\nSensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ of the algorithm are:\n▶\nThe UAV has two modes of functioning, loiter mode\
    \ and segment tracking mode, which are\ndecided by the supervisor (in the sense\
    \ that within the collection of waypoints a priori computed,\nsome of them are\
    \ labeled as loiter points).\n▶\nIn both cases, the algorithm provides a heading\
    \ which is the reference to be tracked by the\nUAV. This is in line with standard\
    \ practices, where the heading is decided through some design\nprocedure and the\
    \ velocity and pitch and roll angles are decided at the auto-pilot level (usually\n\
    the velocity is maintained constant and the roll and pitch are taken as needed\
    \ between admissible\nbounds).\n▶\nThe decisions taken by the algorithm and supervisor\
    \ are, ultimately, related to the distance\nbetween the current position and some\
    \ point of interest. To do so, we consider some circles of\ninterest, deﬁned as\
    \ follows:\n#\nCommunication circle: the UAV communicates with the ground-based\
    \ cluster head only\nwhen it is within the communication radius.\n#\nWaypoint\
    \ update circle: it is impractical to assume that the UAV passes through the exact\n\
    coordinates of the current waypoint. Thus, we update the active segment (by advancing\n\
    through the list of waypoints) whenever we are close enough to the end-point of\
    \ the\ncurrent segment.\n#\nLoitering circle: whenever the UAV is required to\
    \ spend a signiﬁcant time in communication\nwith the current cluster head, the\
    \ decision to start loitering is taken. The loitering radius is\nrestricted to\
    \ be less than the communication radius and larger than the physical limitations\n\
    imposed by the roll angle bounds (a tighter circle means a larger roll angle).\n\
    #\nProximity circle: the procedure employed in the algorithm takes (whenever there\
    \ is\nintersection between the circle and the current segment) the heading angle\
    \ in the direction\nof the intersection point (the one closest to the end-point\
    \ of the segment).\n▶\nWhen the last waypoint is covered, the UAV returns to base\
    \ (by default, we consider this to be\nthe initial point on the trajectory).\n\
    Without being exhaustive, some of the most relevant updates in the algorithm are:\n\
    In segment tracking mode:\n1.\nAt the current time, we consider the UAV position\
    \ (x,y), the segment determined by the current\n(CP) and next waypoint (CP + 1):\n\
    \x10\nwi\nx, wi\ny\n\x11\n,\n\x10\nwi+1\nx\n, wi+1\ny\n\x11\n.\n2.\nWe compute\
    \ the projection of the current point onto the current segment (PP). We identify\
    \ three\npossible cases by checking the relative position of the projection wrt\
    \ the segment’s end points\n(described by W): inside the segment (0 ≤ W ≤ 1)),\
    \ outside and located before the initial segment\nend (W < 0); outside and located\
    \ after the initial segment end (W > 1);\n3.\nWe compute the distance (D) from\
    \ the current point to the segment and the circle of radius L\n(proportional with\
    \ the UAV velocity) and further used to compute the heading vector.\n4.\nWe consider\
    \ the following cases:\ni.\nThe UAV is too far away, and the projection point\
    \ lies before the segment start point. Then,\nthe heading angle points towards\
    \ the projection point.\nii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and the projection\
    \ point lies before the segment start point.\nThen, the heading angle points towards\
    \ the start point.\niii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close to the segment end point,\
    \ or its projection onto the segment\nlies after the end point. Then, the current\
    \ segment is updated, and the procedure jumps to\nstep 4i.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 817\n10 of 25\niv.\nThe UAV is too far away, and its projection lies onto the\
    \ interior of the segment. Then,\nthe heading vector points towards the projection.\n\
    v.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and its projection lies onto the interior of\
    \ the segment.\nThe heading angle is taken as the vector of length L in which\
    \ the tip lies on the segment\n(there are two possible tips; the one closer to\
    \ the segment end point is considered).\n5.\nGo to step 1.\nIn the loitering mode:\n\
    1.\nSelect the loitering center as the current waypoint.\n2.\nConstruct the circle\
    \ of radius L and centered in the current position of the UAV.\n3.\nIf the circle\
    \ does not intersect the loitering circle, move towards the projection point situated\
    \ on\nthe loitering circle.\n4.\nIf the proximity circle intersects the loitering\
    \ circle, take the heading vector along the tangent at\nthe intersection point\
    \ between loitering circle and proximity circle (there are two solutions, we\n\
    selected depending on the desired loitering rotation—clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\
    Note that all steps where a decision regarding the trajectory update is taken\
    \ consist in fact in a\ndecision about the UAV’s heading. Thus, for trajectory\
    \ tracking, only the heading angle is used as\ncontrol input. This suﬃces for\
    \ relatively simple trajectories and is robust against wind disturbances\n(as\
    \ later shown in the simulations).\n2.3. Relevant Data Extraction\nThe collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level, cluster head level,\
    \ UAV level\nup to the cloud. Alongside these steps, information is gradually\
    \ extracted through various methods\nthat enable local decisions based on the\
    \ conﬁguration of the system (thresholding, consensus, symbolic\naggregate approximation,\
    \ etc.).\nIn-ﬁeld data processing is ensured both at local level (independent\
    \ data ﬁltering) and decentralized\nat network level (through data exchange between\
    \ neighbor sensory nodes). The proposed data\nprocessing mechanisms, tailored\
    \ for in-ﬁeld level, are designed in order to ensure a substantial\nweighted average.\
    \ This step is found as ‘Enable consensus dialog’. Once the convergence is reached,\n\
    each node performs a routine for results analysis basically seeking to discover\
    \ and mark nodes with\ndivergent values. This information remains available alongside\
    \ the consensus value so that it can be\ninterrogated by the higher level of data\
    \ processing if needed. This is found in Figure 4 as ‘Analyze\nresults step’.\n\
    Aggregated data sets are achieved through diﬀerent methods. All seek for relevant\
    \ data points,\naiming to a reduced size set and providing at the same time a\
    \ satisfying reconstruction of the initial\ndata. The proposed method for data\
    \ aggregation is based on the minimum and maximum values\nextraction, computed\
    \ as global extremes for a predeﬁned period of time (e.g., a day). It is obvious\
    \ that\nthis method is suitable only for measurements that have a periodic behavior,\
    \ with smooth variations\nduring the day. A measurement for which this method\
    \ is suitable is the soil temperature. Conversely,\nchange detection is commonly\
    \ used for irregularly-shaped data sets. This method follows extraction of\nlocal\
    \ extreme points where trend changes occur.\nGiven a set of data points (xi, yi),\
    \ i = 1, . . . , n, trend ti is computed for each sequence\nmeasurements such\
    \ that for a measure m, (5),(6),(7) has to be true. If ti , ti+1, then it means\
    \ that a trend\nchange has occurred, and the data point (xi, yi) is added to the\
    \ relevant data set.\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni > δm ⇒ tm\ni = 1,\n(5)\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni\

    3.3. Data Processing Results \nAs previously discussed, the primary local distributed agreement is based on consensus among \n\
    the  clustered  sensing  nodes.  This  allows  the  nodes  to  have  a  unitary \
    \ representation  of  the \nmeasurements, under the assumption of limited variance in the geographical sensing area for one \n\
    cluster. The parameters that are sampled by the nodes include: air temperature, relative humidity, \n\
    soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation.   \nFigure 18 illustrates the consensus results for two parameters: soil moisture and air temperature \n\
    in a cluster of five TelosB sensor nodes. These are obtained through simulation in a Contiki/COOJA \n\
    network environment starting from ground‐collected values. The main insight provided by this result \n\
    is  in  the  analysis  of  the  convergence  time  and  convergence  values  in \
    \ conjunction  with  fixed  or \ndynamic  tuning  parameters.  More  specifically, \
    \ by  adjusting  the  communication  frequency  and \nweighting the consensus algorithm based on the sensor location and confidence levels, we can guide \n\
    the algorithm with expert knowledge. This can result in acceleration of the process or in more reliable \n\
    consensus values. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 18. Consensus results for: (a) soil moisture and (b) air temperature. \n\
    Once local agreement has been established, relevant data extraction is performed at the cluster \n\
    head by means of the SAX method. In this case, we present the outcome for running the algorithm \n\
    on a data sample of around 10 days, with the consensus values stored at 30‐min intervals at one \n\

    Once local agreement has been established, relevant data extraction is performed\
    \ at the cluster\nhead by means of the SAX method. In this case, we present the\
    \ outcome for running the algorithm on a\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n21 of 25\ndata\
    \ sample of around 10 days, with the consensus values stored at 30-min intervals\
    \ at one cluster head\n(Table 2). The variations in the SAX string length correspond\
    \ to the parameterization of the method in\nterms of the number of segments to\
    \ divide the input time series into (nseg) and the alphabet size, i.e.,\nthe discrete\
    \ threshold levels numbers for classifying the processed values (alphabet_size).\
    \ The number\nof samples of the input data is 490, for nseg = 20, corresponding\
    \ to half daily patterns this is truncated\nto 480 as the total length of the\
    \ time series must be divisible with the number of segments. Inputs are\nz-normalized\
    \ for the computation of the assigned label. Data were collected in mid-July 2018.\n\

    \ can be expanded and further processed at the decision level, in the cloud. At\

    tables Abstract The Internet of Robotic Things is an emerging vision that brings
    together pervasive sensors and objects with robotic and autonomous systems. This
    survey examines how the merger of robotic and Internet of Things technologies
    will advance the abilities of both the current Internet of Things and the current
    robotic systems, thus enabling the creation of new, potentially disruptive services.
    We discuss some of the new technological challenges created by this merger and
    conclude that a truly holistic view is needed but currently lacking. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics communities have so far been driven
    by different yet highly complementary objectives, the first focused on supporting
    information services for pervasive sensing, tracking and monitoring; the latter
    on producing action, interaction and autonomous behaviour. For this reason, it
    is increasingly claimed that the creation of an internet of robotic things (IoRT)
    combining the results from the two communities will bring a strong added value.1–3
    Early signs of the IoT-robotics convergence can be seen in distributed, heterogeneous
    robot control paradigms like network robot systems4 or robot ecologies,5 or in
    approaches such as ubiquitous robotics6–8 and cloud robotics9–12 that place resource-intensive
    features on the server side.13,14 The term ‘Internet of robotic things’ itself
    was coined in a report of ABI research1 to denote a concept where sensor data
    from a variety of sources are fused, processed using local and distributed intelligence
    and used to control and manipulate objects in the physical world. In this cyber-physical
    perspective of the IoRT, sensor and data analytics technologies from the IoT are
    used to give robots a wider situational awareness that leads to better task execution.
    use cases include intelligent transportation15 and companion robots.16 Later uses
    of the term IoRT in literature adopted alternative perspectives of this term:
    for example, one that focuses on the robust team communication,17–19 and a ‘robot-aided
    IoT’ view where robots are just additional sensors.20,21 Cloud computing and the
    IoT are two non-robotic enablers in creating distributed robotic systems (see
    Figure 1). IoT technologies have three tenets22: (i) sensors proliferated in the
    environment and on our bodies; (ii) smart connected objects using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication; and (iii) data analytics and semantic technologies transforming
    raw sensor data. Cloud computing provides on-demand, networked access to a pool
    of virtualized hardware resources (processing, storage) or higher level services.
    Cloud infrastructure has been used by the IoT community to deploy scalable IoT
    platform services that govern access to (raw, processed or fused) sensor data.
    Processing the data streams generated by billions of IoT devices in a handful
    of centralized data centres brings concerns on response time latency, massive
    ingress bandwidth needs and data privacy. Edge computing (also referred to as
    fog computing, cloudlets) brings on-demand and elastic computational resources
    to the edge of the network, closer to the producers of data23. The cloud paradigm
    was also adopted by the robotics community, called cloud robotics9–12 for offloading
    resource-intensive tasks,13,14 for the sharing of data and knowledge between robots24
    and for reconfiguration of robots following an app-store model.25 Although there
    is an overlap between cloud robotics and IoRT, the former paradigm is more oriented
    towards providing network-accessible infrastructure for computational power and
    storage of data and knowledge, while the latter is more focused on M2M communication
    and intelligent data processing. The focus of this survey is on the latter, discussing
    the potential added value of the IoT-robotics crossover in terms of improved system
    abilities, as well as the new technological challenges posed by the crossover.
    Figure 1. The scope of this review paper is the IoT as enabler in distributed
    robotic systems. IoT: Internet of Things. As one of the goals of this survey is
    to inspire researchers on the potential of introducing IoT technologies in robotic
    systems and vice versa, we structure our discussion along the system abilities
    commonly found in robotic systems, regardless of specific robot embodiment or
    application domains. Finding a suitable taxonomy of abilities is a delicate task.
    In this work, we build upon an existing community effort and adopt the taxonomy
    of nine system abilities, defined in the euRobotics roadmap,26 which shapes the
    robotic research agenda of the European Commission. Interestingly, these abilities
    are closely related to the research challenges identified in the US Robotics roadmap27
    (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Mapping between the system abilities defined in the
    multi-annual roadmap of euRobotics26 – along which this review is structured –
    and the research challenges identified in the roadmap for US Robotics.27 Basic
    abilities Perception ability The sensor and data analytics technologies from the
    IoT can clearly give robots a wider horizon compared to local, on-board sensing,
    in terms of space, time and type of information. Conversely, placing sensors on-board
    mobile robots allows to position them in a flexible and dynamic way and enables
    sophisticated active sensing strategies. A key challenge of perception in an IoRT
    environment is that the environmental observations of the IoRT entities are spatially
    and temporally distributed.28 Some techniques must be put in place to allow robots
    to query these distributed data. Dietrich et al.29 propose to use local databases,
    one in each entity, where data are organized in a spatial hierarchy, for example,
    an object has a position relative to a robot, the robot is positioned in a room
    and so on. Other authors30,31 propose that robots send specific observation requests
    to the distributed entities, for example, a region and objects of interest: this
    may speed up otherwise intractable sensor processing problems (see Figure 3).
    Figure 3. Distributed cameras assist the robot in locating a charging station
    in an environment. The charging station was placed between a green and yellow
    visual marker (location A). Visual markers of the same colours were placed elsewhere
    in the environment to simulate distractors. Visual processing is performed on-demand
    on the camera nodes to inform the robot that the charging station is at location
    A and not at the distracting location B (Image from Chamberlain et al.30) (c)
    2016 IEEE. A key component of robots’ perception ability is getting knowledge
    of their own location, which includes the ability to build or update models of
    the environment.32 Despite great progress in this domain, self-localization may
    still be challenging in crowded and/or Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied
    indoor environments, especially if high reliability is demanded. Simple IoT-based
    infrastructures such as an radio frequency identification (RFID)-enhanced floor
    have been used to provide reliable location information to domestic robots.33
    Other approaches use range-based techniques on signals emitted by off-board infrastructure,
    such as Wi-Fi access points34 and visible light,35 or by IoT devices using protocols
    such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB),36 Zigbee37 or Bluetooth lowenergy.38,39 Motion ability
    The ability to move is one of the fundamental added values of robotic systems.
    While mechanical design is the key factor in determining the intrinsic effectiveness
    of robot mobility, IoT connectivity can assist mobile robots by helping them to
    control automatic doors and elevators, for example in assistive robotics40 and
    in logistic applications.41 IoT platform services and M2M and networking protocols
    can facilitate distributed robot control architectures in large-scale applications,
    such as last mile delivery, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring.
    FIROS42 is a recent tool to connect mobile robots to IoT services by translating
    Robot Operating System (ROS)43 messages into messages grounded in Open Mobile
    Alliance APIs?. Such an interface is suited for robots to act as a mobile sensor
    that publishes its observations and makes them available to any interested IoT
    service. In application scenarios such as search and rescue, where communication
    infrastructure may be absent or damaged, mobile robots may need to set up ad hoc
    networks and use each other as forwarding nodes to maintain communication. While
    the routing protocols developed for mobile ad hoc networks can be readily applied
    in such scenarios, lower overhead and increased energy efficiency can be obtained
    when such protocols explicitly take into account the knowledge of robot’s planned
    movements and activities.44 Sliwa et al.45 propose a similar approach to minimize
    path losses in robot swarms. Manipulation ability While the core motivation of
    the IoT is to sense the environment, the one of robotics is to modify it. Robots
    can grasp, lift, hold and move objects via their end effectors. Once the robot
    has acquired the relevant features of an object, like its position and contours,
    the sequence of torques to be applied on the joints can be calculated via inverse
    kinematics. The added value of IoT is in the acquisition of the object’s features,
    including those that are not observable with the robot’s sensors but have an impact
    on the grasping procedure, such as the distribution of mass, for example, in a
    filled versus an empty cup. Some researchers attached RFID tags to objects that
    contain information about their size, shape and grasping points5. Deyle et al.46
    embedded RFID reader antennas in the finger of a gripper: Differences in the signal
    strength across antennas were used to more accurately position the hand before
    touching the object. Longer range RFID tags were used to locate objects in a kitchen47
    or in smart factories,48,49 as well as to locate the robots themselves.50 Higher
    level abilities Decisional autonomy Decisional autonomy refers to the ability
    of the system to determine the best course of action to fulfil its tasks and missions.26
    This is mostly not considered in IoT middleware:51–53 applications just call an
    actuation API of so-called smart objects that hide the internal complexity.28
    Roboticists often rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning techniques54,55
    based on predictive models of the environment and of the possible actions. The
    quality of the plans critically depends on the quality of these models and of
    the estimate of the initial state. In this respect, the improved situational awareness
    that can be provided by an IoT environment (see “Perception ability” section)
    can lead to better plans. Human-aware task planners56 use knowledge of the intentions
    of the humans inferred through an IoT environment to generate plans that respect
    constraints on human interaction (see Figure 4). Figure 4. The vacuum cleaning
    robot adapts its plan to avoid interference in the kitchen (Figure from Cirillo
    et al.56) (c) 2010 ACM. IoT also widens the scope of decisional autonomy by making
    more actors and actions available, such as controllable elevators and doors.40,57
    However, IoT devices may dynamically become available or unavailable,58 which
    challenges classical multi-agent planning approaches. A solution is to do planning
    in terms of abstract services, which are mapped to actual devices at runtime.59
    Interaction ability This is the ability of a robot to interact physically, cognitively
    and socially either with users, operators or other systems around it.26 While
    M2M protocols60 can be directly adopted in robotic software, we focus here on
    how IoT technologies can facilitate human–robot interaction at functional (commanding
    and programming) and social levels, as well as a means for tele-interaction. Functional
    pervasive IoT sensors can make the functional means of human–robot interaction
    more robust. Natural language instructions are a desirable way to instruct robots,
    especially for non-expert users, but they are often vague or contain implicit
    assumptions.61,62 The IoT can provide information on the position and state of
    objects to disambiguate these instructions (see Figure 5). Gestures are another
    intuitive way to command robots, for instance, by pointing to objects. Recognition
    of pointing gestures from sensors on-board the robot only works within a limited
    field of view.63 External cameras provide a broader scene perspective that can
    improve gesture recognition.64 Wearable sensors have also been used, for example,
    Wolf et al.65 demonstrated a sleeve that measures forearm muscle movements to
    command robot motion and manipulation. Figure 5. Depending on the state of the
    environment, a natural language instructions results in different actions to be
    performed (Image from Misra et al.62) (c) 2016 SAGE. Social body cues like gestures,
    voice or face expression can be used to estimate the user’s emotional state66
    and make the robot respond to it.67,68 The integration with body-worn IoT sensors
    can improve this estimate by measuring physiological signals: Leite et al.69 measured
    heart rate and skin conductance to estimate engagement, motivation and attention
    during human–robot interaction. Others have used these estimates to adapt the
    robot’s interaction strategy, for example, in the context of autism therapy70
    or for stress relievement.71 Tele-interaction robots have also been used besides
    IoT technologies for remote interaction, especially in healthcare. Chan et al.72
    communicate hugs and manipulations between persons via sensorized robots. Al-Taee
    et al.73 use robots to improve the tele-monitoring of diabetes patients by reading
    out the glucose sensor and vocalizing the feedback from the carer (see Figure
    6). Finally, in the GiraffPlus project?, a tele-presence robot was combined with
    environmental sensors to provide health-related data to a remote therapist. Figure
    6. The robot acts as a master Bluetooth device that reads out glucose sensors
    and transfers them to the caregivers. The robot is then used to provide verbal
    information concerning the patient’s diet, insulin bolus/intake, and so on (Image
    from Al-Taee et al.73) (c) 2017 IEEE. Cognitive ability By reasoning on and inferring
    knowledge from experience, cognitive robots are able to understand the relationship
    between themselves and the environment, between objects, and to assess the possible
    impact of their actions. Some aspects of cognition were already discussed in the
    previous sections, for example, multi-modal perception, deliberation and social
    intelligence. In this section, we focus on the cognitive tasks of reasoning and
    learning in an IoRT multi-actor setting. Knowledge models are important components
    of cognitive architectures.74,75 Ontologies are a popular technique in both IoT
    and robotics for structured knowledge. Example ontologies describing the relationship
    between an agent and its physical environment are the Semantic Sensor Network,76
    IoT-A77 and the IEEE Ontologies for Robotics and Automation78 (ORA). For example,
    Jorge et al.79 use the ORA ontology for spatial reasoning between two robots that
    must coordinate in providing a missing tool to a human. Recent works??? harness
    the power of the cloud to derive knowledge from multi-modal data sources, such
    as human demonstrations, natural language or raw sensor data observations?, and
    to provide a virtual environment for simulating robot control policies. In an
    IoRT environment, these knowledge engines will be able to incorporate even more
    sources of data. In the IoT domain, cognitive techniques were recently proposed
    for the management of distributed architectures.80,81 Here, the system self-organizes
    a pipeline of data analytics modules on a distributed set of sensor nodes, edge
    cloud and so on. To our knowledge, the inclusion of robots in these pipelines
    has not yet been considered. If robots subscribe themselves as additional actors
    in the environment, then this gives rise to a new strand of problems in distributed
    consensus and collaboration for the IoT, because robots typically have a larger
    degree of autonomy than traditional IoT ‘smart’ objects, and because they are
    able to modify the physical environment leading to complex dependencies and interactions.
    System level abilities Configurability This is the ability of a robotic system
    to be configured to perform a given task or reconfigured to perform different
    tasks.26 IoT is mainly instrumental in supporting software configurability, in
    particular to orchestrate the concerted configuration of multiple devices, each
    contributing different capabilities and cooperating to the achievement of complex
    objectives. However, work in IoT does not explicitly address the requirement of
    IoRT systems to exchange continuous streams of data while interacting with the
    physical world. This requirement is most prominent in the domains of logistic
    and of advanced manufacturing, where a fast reaction to disruptions is needed,
    together with flexible adaptation to varying production objectives. Kousi et al.82
    developed a service-oriented architecture to support autonomous, mobile production
    units which can fuse data from a peripheral sensing network to detect disturbances.
    Michalos et al.83 developed a distributed system for data sharing and coordination
    of human–robot collaborative operations, connected to a centralized task planner.
    Production lines have also been framed as multi-agent systems84,85 equipped with
    self-descriptive capabilities to reduce set-up and changeover times. General purpose
    middlewares have also been developed to support distributed task coordination
    and control in IoRT environments. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform86 is a
    general purpose middleware for IoRT environments (see Figure 7). It manages the
    handover of functionality for services using real and virtual robots, for example
    reserving a real assistant robot using a virtual robot on the smartphone. Figure
    7. The Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform is a two-layered platform. The LPF configures
    a robotic system in a single area. The GPF is a middle-layer between the LPFs
    of different areas and the service applications (Image from Nishio et al.86).
    LPF: local platform; GPF: global platform (c) 2013 Springer-Verlag. Configurability
    can be coupled with decision ability to lead to the ability of a system to self-configure.
    Self-configuration is especially challenging in an IoRT system since the configuration
    algorithms must take into account both the digital interactions between the actors
    and their physical interactions through the real world. The ‘PEIS Ecology’ framework5
    includes algorithms for the self-configuration of a robot ecology: complex functionality
    is achieved by composing a set of devices with sensing, acting and/or computational
    capabilities, including robots. A shared tuple-space blackboard allows for high
    level collaboration and dynamic reconfiguration.87 Adaptability This is the ability
    of the system to adapt to different work scenarios, environments and conditions.26
    This includes the ability to adapt to unforeseen events, faults, changing tasks
    and environments and unexpected human behaviour. The key enablers for adaptability
    are the perception, decisional and configuration abilities as described above.
    Hence, we will now discuss relevant application domains and supporting platforms.
    Mobile robots are used in precision agriculture for the deployment of herbicide,
    fertilizer or irrigation.88 These robots need to adapt to spatio-temporal variations
    of crop and field patterns, crop sizes, light and weather conditions, soil quality,
    and so on.89 Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) can provide the necessary information,90,91
    for example, knowledge of soil moisture may be used to ensure accurate path tracking.92,93
    Gealy et al.94 use a robot to adjust the drip rate of individual water emitters
    to allow for plant-level control of irrigation. This is a notable example of how
    robots are used to adjust IoT devices. Some platforms supporting adaptation of
    IoRT have also been showcased in the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL).
    Building on OSGi, a platform for IoT home automation, AIOLOS exposes robots and
    IoT devices as reusable and shareable services, and automatically optimizes the
    runtime deployment across distributed infrastructure, for example, by placing
    a shared data processing service closer to the source sensor.95,96 Bacciu et al.97,98
    deploy recurrent neural networks on distributed infrastructure to automatically
    learn user preferences, and to detect disruptive environmental changes like the
    addition of a mirror.99 Dependability Dependability is a multifaceted attribute,
    covering the reliability of hardware and software robotic components, safety guarantees
    when cooperating with humans and the degree to which systems can continue their
    missions when failures or other unforeseen circumstances occur. In this section,
    we follow the classification of means of dependability identified by Crestani
    et al.100 A first means of dependability is to forecast faults or conflicts. For
    instance, robots in a manufacturing plant must stop if an operator comes too near.
    IoT technology can provide useful tools to realize this. Rampa et al.101 mounted
    a network of small tranceivers in a robotic cell and estimated the user position
    from the perturbations of the radio field. Other researchers embedded sensors
    in clothing and on the helmet. Qian et al.102 developed a probabilistic framework
    to avoid conflicts of robot and human motion, by combining observations from fixed
    cameras and on-board sensors with historical knowledge on human trajectories (see
    Figure 8). Figure 8. Sensory data from laser and global cameras are fed to the
    perception module, together with human motion patterns learned by the modelling
    module. Then three types of abstracted observations are inputted to the controller:
    PAO, PRO and RSO. Using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, a suitable
    navigational policy is generated (Image from Qian et al.102). PAO: people’s action
    observation; PRO: people-robot relation observation; RSO: robot state observation
    (c) 2013 SAGE. In a marine context, acoustic sensor networks have been used to
    provide information on water current and ship positions to a path planner for
    underwater gliders, to avoid collisions when they come to the surface103 or to
    preserve energy.104 A second means of dependability is robust system engineering.
    This can take new forms in an IoRT system. For instance, mobile wireless communication
    is a key enabler for industry 4.0, where both field devices, fixed machines and
    mobile AGV are connected. IoT protocols such as WirelessHart or Zigbee Pro were
    designed to address the industry concerns on reliability, security and cost.105
    When mobility is involved, however, these protocols must be complemented by meshing
    technologies to cope with handovers and with the massive presence of metal.106,107
    The last means is fault tolerance, which allows the system to keep working even
    when components fail. Redundancy is key to fault tolerance, and the IoRT enables
    redundancy of sensors, information and actuation. Data fusion from both on-board
    and environment sensors, however, requires a good understanding of the spatial
    and temporal relationship between the observations from different sensors. Such
    relationships have been explicitly modelled, for example, in the Positioning Ontology79
    (POS), or implicitly learned as part of modular deep neural network controller.108
    Conclusion Robotics and IoT are two terms each covering a myriad of technologies
    and concepts. In this review, we have unravelled the added value of the crossover
    of both technology domains into nine system abilities. The IoT advantages exploited
    by roboticists are mostly distributed perception and M2M protocols. Conversely,
    the IoT has so far mostly exploited robots for active sensing strategies. Current
    IoRT incarnations are almost uniquely found in vertical application domains, notably
    AAL, precision agriculture and Industry 4.0. Domain-agnostic solutions, for example,
    to integrate robots in IoT middleware platforms, are only emerging. It is our
    conviction that the IoRT should go beyond the readings of ‘IoT-aided robots’ or
    ‘Robot-enhanced IoT’. We hope that this survey may stimulate researchers from
    both disciplines to start work towards an ecosystem of IoT agents, robots and
    the cloud that combines both the above readings in a holistic way. Declaration

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ the “network end” of IoT. According to the different functions implemented by\
    \ physical \nentity services in the IoT, IoT architecture established by the current\
    \ service-oriented approach can \nbe divided into the following two categories:\
    \ cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT \narchitecture. In the\
    \ cloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ \nbasic physical information collection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information \nto the cloud, but does not provide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational \nprocessing and knowledge mining of physical\

    \ is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the \nuID\
    \ center of the nonprofit standardization organization initiated by the university\
    \ of Tokyo, Japan. \nAs shown in Figure 1, its architecture consisted of ucode\

    \ years, under the impetus of organizations such as Internet Protocol for Smart\
    \ Objects \n(IPSO) Alliance, resource-constrained intelligent goods and sensing\
    \ nodes can access the internet \nthrough the IP protocol and become devices that\
    \ can be directly addressed in the network space \n[18]. Based on the service-oriented\
    \ design method, researchers have proposed a variety of software \narchitecture\

    \ architecture combined the back-end cloud service with the front-end physical\
    \ \nentity service and proposed a 3-layer information physical fusion system software\
    \ architecture \nconsisting of the environment layer, the service layer and the\
    \ control layer. As shown in Figure 3, \nthe physical components in the environment\
    \ layer were services provided by the perceptron and \nthe executor. The cloud\
    \ service components in the service layer were services provided by \nplatforms\
    \ such as traditional cloud computing. As well, the following functions were implemented\
    \ \nin the control layer: monitoring physical components and services, ensuring\
    \ dynamic \ncomposability, ensuring service adaptability; and ensuring autonomous\
    \ Cyber-Physical System \nmanagement [20]. This architecture provides services\
    \ for collecting physical data and interacting \nwith the physical world. However,\
    \ these services do not constitute an independent executable IoT \nsystembut needto\
    \ be called by the user or combined with the cloud service to complete the \n\

    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

  title: State-of-the-Art Internet of Things in Protected Agriculture
  verbatim_quote1: Sensors play an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant
    and animal information and it is also one of the technical bottlenecks in the
    development of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology has rapidly developed with
    the emergence of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional environment
    sensors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have
    been relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture.
  verbatim_quote2: With development of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with
    power-based routing, where one node forwards packets of other nodes. It uses dedicated
    frequency bands and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology
    has carrier-class security and low interference characteristics, which forms full
    network coverage and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common
    spectrum without paying high spectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel
    interference. There are many beneﬁts of IoT deployments based on LPWAN in the

    terminal device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several
    tens of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing
    devices.

    Get rights and content Abstract In recent years, Sensor–Cloud System (SCS) has
    become a hot research issue. In this system, there are some cyber security problems
    that can be well solved by the trust mechanism. However, there are still some
    deficiencies in existing trust mechanisms, especially for the SCS underlying structure.
    We proposed a fog-based hierarchical trust mechanism for these cyber security
    deficiencies. This hierarchical mechanism consists of two parts, trust in the
    underlying structure and trust between cloud service providers (CSPs) and sensor
    service providers (SSPs). For trust in the underlying structure, the behavior
    monitoring part is established and implemented in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),
    and the fine-grained and complicated data analysis part is moved to the fog layer.
    For trust between CSPs and SSPs, it focuses more on the real-time comparison of
    service parameters, the gathering of exception information in WSNs, the targeted
    quantitative evaluation of entities and so on. The experimental results indicate
    that this fog-based hierarchical structure performs well in saving network energy,
    detecting malicious nodes rapidly and recovering misjudgment nodes in an acceptable
    delay. Furthermore, the reliability of edge nodes is well guaranteed by data analyses
    in the fog layer and an evaluation strategy based on similar service records is
    put forward. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Questions answered

    mechanismMisjudgment nodeEdge node 1. Introduction SCS is an effective combination
    of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Cloud Computing, which bonds physical sensor
    nodes, applications and users together [1]. SCS solves some deficiencies which
    are in traditional wireless sensor networks, like the sensor-node-sharing problem
    that applications monopolize physical sensor nodes, the data-analyzing problem
    that WSNs cannot cope well with large amounts of data analysis tasks due to limitations
    in term of memory, energy, computing power and so on, the user-away-from problem
    that users cannot get heterogeneous network services as sensing-as-service, etc.
    [[2], [3]]. Some researchers suggest that Cloud Computing can solve WSNs’ deficiencies
    based on its advantages in terms of technology and economics, so the concept of
    SCS generates and becomes a hot issue [4]. It virtualizes physical sensor nodes
    to Cloud so that end users can obtain required sensor data by using virtual sensor
    services [5]. SCS not only provides users with customized services, but also improves
    the utilization of sensor nodes by way of making various services no longer occupy
    physical sensors alone. However, there are some cyber security problems in SCS
    that need to be solved, like privacy, internal attacks and external attacks [[6],
    [7]]. The traditional security mechanism, like encryption, authorization, authentication,
    does well in curbing external attacks [[8], [9]]. However, it is lack of effective
    resistance on internal attacks due to malicious attackers entering the network
    by legal identities [[10], [11]]. In SCS, some internal attacks become more serious,
    which occur in the wireless sensor networks layer and the junction between the
    wireless sensor networks layer and the cloud layer, for the immaturity technology
    of SCS and WSNs’ limitations in computing power, storage capacity and energy [[12],
    [13], [14]]. A well designed trust mechanism can find malicious entities and eliminate
    security risks by monitoring behaviors of internal attack entities [[15], [16]].
    Moreover, the trust mechanism is more suitable for WSNs than the traditional security
    mechanism due to its light weight in cyber security [[17], [18]]. However, the
    research on the trust mechanism of SCS is not perfect, especially in the Sensor–Cloud
    underlying structure. There are many aspects that should be concerned, such as
    energy consumption of establishing trust mechanism in WSNs, how to find hidden
    data attack, how to ensure outer nodes credible and how to recover misjudgment
    sensor nodes. In addition, there are two problems that need to be solved in the
    establishment of trusted third-part. (1) How to establish the trust relationship
    that is SSPs to CSPs. CSPs have some characteristics, such as the service similarity,
    the service dynamics, the changing service quality and so on [[19], [20]]. (2)
    How to establish the trust relationship that is CSPs to SSPs. SSPs may provide
    tampered data, do not guarantee real-time data, submit low quality data and so
    on. The quality of service (QoS) of SCS is ensured by the quality of data that
    are from WSNs. To solve these problems, we adopt Fog Computing, which is closer
    to WSNs and can be designed as a trusted third party, for Fog Computing can extend
    Cloud Computing to the network edge [21]. In this paper, we proposed and designed
    a fog-based hierarchical trust mechanism for SCS in detail. In summary, we add
    the fog layer in Sensor–Cloud for following three objectives: (1) The fog layer
    can reduce energy consumption, detect malicious nodes rapidly and recover misjudgment
    nodes in an acceptable delay. (2) The fog layer can secure the whole WSNs from
    a global perspective and realize more functions, such as ensuring edge nodes credible
    and finding hidden data attacks. (3) The fog layer can assist CSPs and SSPs in
    establishing trust relationship in a more comprehensive and credible means. The
    rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces SCS structure,
    Fog Computing and development of trust mechanisms in SCS. Section 3 gives network
    model and design framework. Section 4 describes detailed design of trust mechanism.
    Section 5 provides analyses of experimental results. The last Section concludes
    this paper. 2. Related work 2.1. The general SCS structure The general SCS structure
    consists of the user layer, the cloud layer and the wireless sensor networks layer
    as shown as Fig. 1. For the wireless sensor networks layer, researchers focus
    on the management strategy that aims at how to efficiently and optimally improve
    the utilization of physical sensor nodes, that is to say, a physical sensor node
    should service multiple sets of applications; for the cloud layer, the main work
    is establishing virtual sensor groups corresponding to physical sensor nodes and
    allocating virtual sensor nodes to users according to their requirement, in other
    words, users will not need to pay attention to the design and organization document
    of WSNs, which achieves great implementation efficiency and operation flexibility;
    for the user layer, the focus is on the design of application software and user
    interfaces that help users accurately publish requirements and find available
    resources. SCS is applied in environmental monitoring, disease surveillance, wildlife
    monitoring, remote sensing, agriculture and irrigation control, and so on [[22],
    [23]]. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download : Download full-size

    breaches, they can exists in every part of SCS, such as data generation, data
    transmission, in-network processing and the cloud [24]. In WSNs, captured nodes
    can lead to fake sensor data through producing fake sensor data in data generation
    and providing some fake sensor data in in-network processing. Moreover, captured
    nodes can also steal data through many routing attacks, such as Sybil attack,
    wormhole attack and so on. In cloud, the data owner loses the direct control of
    sensor data, and the attacker can breaches data integrity and availability by
    malicious virtual machines (VMs). Trust management and trust dynamics are a decision
    aid complementary to cryptography, authentication, and stenography. In SCS, there
    are two very critical and barely explored issues. The one is fake services among
    Cloud Service Users (CSUs), Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Sensor Network
    Providers (SNPs), which occurs in CSPs–CSUs and SNPs–CSPs. Another is that CSPs
    and CSUs likely select low trust and reputation service providers without the
    help of a trust and reputation calculation and management system. To solve these
    problems, Zhu et al. [25] proposed an authenticated trust and reputation calculation
    and management (ATRCM) system. ATRCM can avoid malicious impersonation attacks,
    moreover, it can help CSUs choose desirable CSPs and assist CSPs in selecting
    appropriate SNPs. To improve the quality of service (QoS) of Sensor–Cloud, Zhu
    et al. [26] proposed Trust-Assisted Sensor–Cloud (TASC), where trusted sensors
    and trusted data centers are selected to assist data transmission from sensors
    to users. However, there should be more service parameters that should be considered
    during the establishment of trust and reputation among CPUs, CSPs and SNPs, such
    as real-time, similarity and integrity. To protect sensor data in the cloud, Henze
    et al. [27] proposed a trust point-based security architecture, which is a security-enhanced
    gateway against unauthorization access. In this trust model, there are three parts,
    which are the producer domain (sensor nodes and gateway devices, data owners),
    the storage domain (cloud, cloud providers) and the consumer domain (services,
    service providers). The trust point is an enhanced gateway device, which locates
    between data owner and cloud and guarantees the security of data transmission.
    However, it cannot guarantee that sensor data and cloud providers are credible.
    In WSNs, trust models are divided into the node trust model and the data trust
    model [[15], [28], [29]]. In the node trust model, there are two types, the centralized
    trust model and the distributed trust model. For the centralized trust model,
    a base station or cluster head do trust value calculations for sensor nodes. It
    takes the base station or cluster head more burden in communication, computing,
    storage and so on. For the distributed trust model, sensor nodes do trust value
    calculations by themselves. The more trust evidences are collected or the more
    complicated the theory for trust calculation is, the more resources of network
    are consumed, which is bad to resource-constrained WSNs. In the data trust model,
    the key is how to distinguish modified data and original data. Many researchers
    pay more attention in WSNs, such as sensor node identity, data similarity and
    data forwarding delay. However, it will consume more network resources when the
    data trust is established in WSNs. There are many types of trust models in Cloud,
    such as feedback based, agent based, log based, authentication based and SLA (Service-Level
    Agreement) based [30]. For SCS, its three layers can be abstracted as three entities
    that are CSUs, CSPs and SSPs. Most researchers focus on how to establish trust
    on CSPs, but there are few studies on trust relationships of CSPs to SSPs or CSPs
    to CSUs. Moreover, the trust value has timeliness and locality. So, when updating
    trust values, there are more factors that should be considered, such as service
    dynamics, user cultural differences, demand diversification and evaluation criteria
    deviation. To some extent, the scalable evaluation standard and the detailed assessment
    criteria are two important directions of SCS trust mechanisms in the future. Moreover,
    these systems are lack of concrete methods in detecting hidden data attacks, reducing
    energy consumption in WSNs, recovering misjudgment nodes, ensuring edge nodes
    credible and establishing a trusted and real-time third party among three entities
    of SCS. 2.3. Fog Computing Fog Computing is proposed firstly by Cisco, which aims
    to extend Cloud Computing to the edge of network [31]. It is applied to many fields,
    such as vehicle networking, smart grid, smart city and WSNs. The definition of
    the fog [32]: “fog computing is a scenario where a huge number of heterogeneous
    (wireless and sometimes autonomous) ubiquitous and decentralized devices communicate
    and potentially cooperate among them and with the network to perform storage and
    processing tasks without the intervention of third parties. These tasks can be
    for supporting basic network functions or new services and applications that run
    in a sandboxed environment. Users leasing part of their devices to host these
    services get incentives for doing so”. Fog Computing is located between Cloud
    Computing and edge networks, with low latency, location awareness, mobility, real-time,
    supporting heterogeneous devices and so on. 3. Preliminary 3.1. WSNs model WSNs
    can be composed of multiple cluster structures with the efficient data collection
    and node management capability. The cluster structure is expressed as managing
    many adjacent sensor nodes that are in same geographic area or implementing monitoring
    functions by the mutual cooperation among many adjacent sensor nodes. A cluster
    structure consists of more than one cluster heads and many intra cluster nodes
    that cooperate with others to complete some tasks. Many cluster structures are
    combined together to realize complex network function with lower energy consumption.
    In the design, we adopt a multi-cluster-heads structure which is not only convenient
    to manage intra cluster nodes but also realizes the mutual supervision among cluster
    heads. Ho et al. in [33] proposed a ladder diffusion algorithm to reduce routing
    loops and extend network lifetime. Based on this routing algorithm, we do a change
    that nodes can transfer data to peer layer and upper layer. The sketch map of
    SCS underlying structure is shown as Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image

    with a ladder diffusion algorithm. 3.2. A novel framework for trust mechanism
    in SCS We propose a new framework to solve some problems in trust mechanisms of
    SCS as shown as Fig. 3. In this framework, the fog layer has three main functions.
    (1) The fog layer acts as a trust buffer zone between the cloud layer and the
    wireless sensor networks layer, which mainly focuses on three parts, collecting
    network state evidences, recording service details and monitoring service parameters.
    (2) The fog layer executes some tasks, such as data pre-processing, temporary
    storage, small-scale calculation and providing Cloud with services. (3) The fog
    layer has virtualization capability and node task allocation mechanisms, which
    transfer virtualization from the cloud layer to the fog layer. For the establishment
    of trust mechanism in SCS, the fog layer does well in three aspects. The first
    one is that the fog layer gets the whole trust state of WSNs. The second one is
    that the fog layer can deal with some data analysis tasks to find hidden data
    attacks, ensure edge nodes credible and recover misjudgment nodes. The third one
    is that the fog layer assists in establishing trust relationships between CSPs
    and SSPs through evidences collected and service records. There are three major
    database centers in the fog layer, which are the sensor database, the event control
    database and the service providing database. The sensor database mainly stores
    impermanent real-time data from WSNs, which can be used for some data analysis
    tasks; the event control database mainly does some judgments about exceptions
    uploaded from WSNs; the service providing database mainly provides CSPs with data
    services and does some monitoring tasks on service parameters. Download : Download

    mechanism framework with Fog Computing. 3.3. Analysis of the novel trust mechanism
    Fog Computing is the extension of Cloud Computing, so some security mechanisms
    that are in Cloud Computing can be used to ensure the security of Fog Computing,
    such as access control, audit, authentication and some complex trust mechanisms.
    In this paper, we mainly focus on two parts of this trust mechanism in SCS, which
    are among entities and in the underlying structure. For the establishment of trust
    among three entities in the fog layer, there is a simple example. Before a service
    transaction, and negotiate service contents and store standard service parameters
    in the fog layer. In the course of service transaction, the fog layer monitors
    both and . On the one hand, the fog layer monitors ’s service parameters and records
    exceptions happening in WSNs. The trust state of is partially updated based on
    these monitoring values in real-time. On the other hand, the fog layer also partially
    updates trust state of based on comparing real-time service parameters and standard
    service parameters. After the service transaction finishes, the detailed service
    record is stored in the fog layer. In other service transactions, this record
    will be used to calculate trust values of and . For the establishment of trust
    in the underlying structure, the data processing capability of sensor nodes is
    limited, so the trust mechanism is designed into three levels with the advantage
    of Fog Computing. The first level is the gathering of observation values among
    physical sensor nodes and the calculation of direct trust, which just requires
    less computing workload; the second level reacts to some abnormal events, such
    as frequent routing failure, longer data forwarding time, larger difference between
    new and old trust value; the third level does data processing, like calculating
    global trust state of WSNs, discovering hidden data attacks, recovering misjudgment
    nodes and so on. 4. Design of trust mechanism 4.1. Direct trust among nodes There
    are many behavior characteristics which can be observed to evaluate the trust
    state of nodes during node interaction process. However, the more characteristics
    are collected, the more difficult the system implementation becomes due to some
    restrictions should be followed, such as energy consumption, network load and
    others. We choose the packet loss rate, the route failure rate and the forwarding
    delay as evidences to assess the trust state of node. The packet loss rate, ,
    refers to the ratio that the number of data packets lost by recipient occupies
    the proportion of the total data packets in a communication cycle, which represents
    a type of evidence that can indicates node state or node whether is breached;
    The route failure rate refers to the ratio that the number of routing packets
    discarded by recipient occupies the proportion of the total routing packets sent
    by sender during an interval of time, which can be used to judge network state;
    The forwarding delay, , refers to the time interval from receiving data to forwarding
    data when relay node transfers data, which represents a type of evidence that
    node has been compromised or has serious fault. The source node can use these
    evidences to establish a direct trust relationship on cooperative nodes. Moreover,
    the observation value of node behavior may fluctuates with the change of environment
    and network load, so the history trust value, , is added into direct trust calculation
    to reduce the misjudgment rate of normal nodes and the unnecessary waste of network
    resources. The formula of direct trust is shown as (1). (1) Where is a very important
    evidence of serious security problem, which is considered that a relay node has
    modified data. When the time interval is greater than threshold, the value of
    is set 0, otherwise 1. If exception occurs, the value of is 0. Otherwise, the
    value of is determined by and based on the weighted algorithm. For weighted values,
    + =1. To reduce node energy consumption in the data transmission, the trust detection
    period among nodes is maximized in a reasonable range. In this case, the trust
    value may become too old to really reflect the present trust state of node. So
    we cut down the weight of by formula (2). (2) Where is the time interval from
    the last update to now. r e a l 1 and r e a l 2 are two real numbers that are
    set at initialization. Theorem 1 The larger the value of P e r i o d n e t w o
    r k is, the faster it converges to T r u s t p a c k e t . Proof Firstly, we take
    derivative of the function to check its changing trend. Then, we find out the
    descent region of this function. Finally, an appropriate descent region is selected
    for the weight setting of P e r i o d n e t w o r k . (3) w 2 ′ = r e a l 1 ×
    P e r i o d n e t w o r k × exp ( − r e a l 2 × P e r i o d n e t w o r k ) ′
    = r e a l 1 × ( 1 − r e a l 2 × P e r i o d n e t w o r k ) × exp ( − r e a l
    2 × P e r i o d n e t w o r k ) (4) w 2 ′ = 0 t h e n P e r i o d n e t w o r
    k = 1 r e a l 2 We can find that the curve goes down with P e r i o d n e t w
    o r k larger than 1 r e a l 2 . The curve drops dramatically in the front part
    and declines stably in the latter part. To achieve an ideal result, the value
    of r e a l 2 can be set in [0.7,1] and the value of r e a l 1 is set according
    to r e a l 2 , which can assign different weighted values to t r u s t h i s t
    o r y according to different P e r i o d n e t w o r k .  □ 4.2. Comprehensive
    trust among nodes In this level, the source node requests recommendation values
    from its trust adjacent nodes when it finds some exceptions of adjacent nodes.
    Meanwhile, the source node also sends these exceptions to the fog layer to analyze
    the trust state of every node in this area. If these abnormal nodes are identified
    as malicious, the fog layer would inform cluster head to isolate these malicious
    nodes. Exceptions in WSNs are divided into three categories, which are the route
    failure rate exception, the forwarding delay exception and the difference value
    exception. The routing failure is a normal phenomenon in WSNs, but it is considered
    as an exception when the route failure rate is up to threshold in a certain period
    of time. When the forwarding delay surpasses threshold, a forwarding delay exception
    occurs. The difference value exception is that the difference value between new
    trust value and historical trust value is beyond the reasonable range. The general
    formula of recommendation trust calculation is shown as (5). (5) T r u s t r e
    c o m m e n d a t i o n = ∑ i ∈ s e t ( n e i g h b o r ) w i ( i , j ) × T r
    u s t ( j , k ) Where s e t ( n e i g h b o r ) is a trust node set of the source
    node. T r u s t ( j , k ) is the trust value of node j to node k . However, the
    source node has different trust values to different adjacent nodes. In this case,
    there should be some mechanisms to properly decrease the impact of low performance
    nodes. Here, we sort trust table of the source node from small to large by trust
    values, then calculate the weighted value of every adjacent node by an arithmetic
    progression, as formula (6). (6) w i ( i , j ) = i ∑ 1 n i = 2 × i n ( n + 1 )
    Where parameter i is the location value of nodes in the ordered trust table and
    parameter n is the node number in s e t ( n e i g h b o r ) . To be specific,
    T r u s t r e c o m m e n d a t i o n gives the source node an advisory opinion,
    and the final decision of the source node is based on T r u s t d i r e c t and
    T r u s t r e c o m m e n d a t i o n as shown as (7). The weighted value of T
    r u s t d i r e c t is larger than T r u s t r e c o m m e n d a t i o n , and
    w 3 + w 4 =1. (7) T r u s t s y n t h e s i s = w 3 × T r u s t d i r e c t +
    w 4 × T r u s t r e c o m m e n d a t i o n Theorem 2 A small proportion of malicious
    recommendation nodes cannot decide T r u s t r e c o m m e n d a t i o n . Proof
    The most trusted node of the source node has the greatest weighted value, which
    is 2 n + 1 . The difference value between weighted values of two adjacent nodes
    in trust table is 2 n ( n + 1 ) . When n is in 2 , 3 , … , n , the corresponding
    greatest weighted value is 2 2 + 1 , 2 3 + 1 , … , 2 n + 1 . The larger n is,
    the smaller the weighted value of every node has.  □ 4.3. Data analysis in the
    fog layer There are three types of data analysis in the fog layer. The first type
    recovers misjudgment nodes and detects hidden data attacks, which is based on
    trust tables, historical sensor data and network topology. The second type inspects
    whether there are some malicious nodes or malicious recommendation nodes after
    receiving exceptions from WSNs, which is based on trust tables, recommendation
    tables, historical sensor data and network topology. The third type is concerned
    about the credibility of edge nodes, which is based on trust tables and sensor
    data correlation. All sensor nodes send change values of trust table along with
    sensor data to the fog layer during a certain period, and the source node sends
    the recommendation table along with sensor data to the fog layer after finishing
    the recommendation trust calculation. The fog layer periodically analyzes the
    global trust state of every node and verdicts whether there are misjudgment nodes
    and hidden data attacks. Moreover, based on these global trust state of nodes,
    we can predict some network status, like network load, residual energy of nodes,
    and so on. Some malicious nodes provide wrong sensor data to lead users make wrong
    decisions. These nodes are more difficult to find, for they behave normally when
    they communicate with other nodes. Within the same area or the same cluster, there
    are some data correlation phenomena, such as sensor data from several nodes in
    the same geographical position are similar, sensor data from several nodes in
    different geographical positions show gradualness, sensor data from several nodes
    moving together have trajectory correlation. The fog layer can process simultaneously
    sensor data from several nodes and analyze whether there are malicious nodes through
    some data correlation phenomenon indicators, such as variation trend, fault-tolerant
    interval, similar trajectory, and so on. The fog layer is closer to WSNs, so the
    delay of detecting hidden data attacks is acceptable. We carry on a multi-path
    operation to analyze sensor data from different nodes. The process structure is
    shown as Fig. 4. Here, we mainly consider nodes that realize the same function
    in the same geographical position. The formula is show as (8). (8) A r r a y =
    C o u n t c r e s t ∪ d e g r e e , X 2 i − X 1 i Y 2 i − Y 1 i > 0 C o u n t
    t r o u g h ∪ d e g r e e , X 2 i − X 1 i Y 2 i − Y 1 i < 0 Where we use A r r
    a y to store the crest, the trough, and the degree. C o u n t c r e s t indicates
    the crest of sensor data curve, which is recorded as 1. C o u n t t r o u g h
    indicates the trough of sensor data curve, which is recorded as − 1 . d e g r
    e e is the difference value between two adjacent sensor data. The judgment of
    crest/trough is continuous two negative/positive values after a positive/negative
    value, and the continuous crest/trough occurs when the change value of sensor

    to inner nodes. We set shorter period detect for edge nodes in WSNs. Moreover,
    the fog layer will scan and analyze trust state of edge nodes in a shorter period.
    4.4. Establishment of trust relationship between SSPs and CSPs The trust relationship
    among CSPs and SSPs is divided into two parts. One is the trust relationship of
    CSPs to SSPs, and the other is the trust relationship of SSPs to CSPs. 4.4.1.
    Trust relationship of CSPs to SSPs For CSPs, they expect that data from SSPs should
    meet some requirements, such as no tampering, integrality, timeliness and precision.
    However, a service user may does not require service providers to meet all needs,
    that is to say, service providers only need to meet the specific requirements
    of the service user. So, there should be some special recommendation mechanisms
    to find CSPs that offer good services in special aspects. Fog Computing can deal
    well with these problems. The trusted third party based on Fog Computing can ensure
    SSPs reliability through three parts as shown as formula (9). (9) T r u s t S
    S P s = w 5 T r u s t s e r v i c e + w 6 T r u s t W S N s + w 7 T r u s t C
    S P s Where T r u s t s e r v i c e is the trust value for service parameters.
    Before a service transaction, SSPs and CSPs negotiate service parameter standards.
    Then, the fog layer monitors these service parameters during a transaction in
    real-time, and contrasts these service parameters with standard values. If the
    value of a monitored service parameter is in the reasonable range, the record
    of this parameter is 1, else 0. Finally, T r u s t s e r v i c e is calculated
    through different weighted values of service parameters. T r u s t W S N s is
    the trust value for WSNs, and it is based on exception information records of
    WSNs. If a WSN has more exceptions in a transaction, it would be given a lower
    value. T r u s t C S P s is a type of trust value that is calculated through the
    record information of other CSPs in the fog layer. There are two steps that are
    used to decide the selection of CSPs, the general recommendation calculation R
    g e n e r a l and the similar recommendation calculation R s i m i l a r . Some
    CSPs are selected into a candidate list, whose service records contain all requested
    service parameters. R g e n e r a l assigns all selected CSPs to different sets
    which are classified by the number of redundant parameters. Then, the trust value
    of every SSP is separately calculated in different sets. Finally, some abnormal
    CSPs are excluded from candidate list according the change rule of trust value
    among different sets. R s i m i l a r is an optimal selection strategy, which
    has many principles that can be selected by service users. T r u s t C S P s is
    calculated with these selected CSPs. w 5 , w 6 and w 7 are three weighted values
    and set at initialization depending on users’ different requirements, and w 5
    + w 6 + w 7 =1. The value of T r u s t s e r v i c e , T r u s t W S N s and T
    r u s t C S P s is in range 0 to 1. 4.4.2. Trust relationship of SSPs to CSPs
    For SSPs, they expect services that are provided by CSPs should meet some criteria,
    such as reliability, security, friendliness, controllability, stability and so
    on. These indicators are important for SSPs to establish trust on CSPs. The fog
    layer can monitor these indicators in real-time. The trust relationship of SSPs
    to CSPs consists of two parts as shown as formula (10). (10) T r u s t S S P s
    = w 8 T r u s t s e r v i c e 1 + w 9 T r u s t S S P s Where T r u s t s e r
    v i c e 1 is the trust value of CSPs’ service parameters that is similar to T
    r u s t s e r v i c e . T r u s t S S P s is calculated with some selected SSPs,
    whose selection process is similar to T r u s t C S P s . In the fog layer, there
    are some databases that are used to store service records of a certain time. w
    8 and w 9 are two weight values and set at initialization depending on users’
    different requirements, and w 8 + w 9 =1. The value of T r u s t s e r v i c e
    1 and T r u s t S S P s is in range 0 to 1. 5. Evaluation The experiment platform
    is MATLAB R2016b. There are six cluster structures with more than three hundred
    nodes which are randomly deployed in the wireless sensor networks layer. Every
    cluster is divided into three levels, where the outer layer has more nodes than
    the inner layer. In every cluster structure, cluster heads can receive sensor
    data packets from six nodes simultaneously. The maximum delay time from WSNs to
    the fog layer is set as seven communication cycle. These parameters are shown
    in Table 1. In the fog layer, there are some record that are close to real records.

    Diffusion Algorithm The number of Clusters 6 The number of Cluster Heads 36 The

    trust update status of nodes There are two types of trust mechanisms, which are
    the periodic update and the aperiodic update. For the aperiodic update, nodes
    update trust states of their adjacent nodes when detecting abnormal behaviors.
    There are some flaws in the aperiodic update, such as too little attention to
    edge nodes and older trust states of nodes, the experiment result is shown as
    Fig. 5 (a). The aperiodic update cannot detect malicious nodes in time. For the
    periodic update, nodes update trust values of their neighbor nodes when the period
    time is over. There are also some disadvantages in the periodic update, like taking
    up too much storage and computing resources, lowering network communication performance
    and so on, whose experiment result is shown in Fig. 5 (b). Our design is based
    on the periodic update. We set that the trust updating cycle at outermost layer
    is the same to the periodic update, which can be found obviously in Fig. 5 (b)
    and 5 (c). We can lengthen the trust updating cycle at inner layer with the help
    of Fog Computing, which can avoid more waste of resources in the periodic detection
    as shown as Fig. 5 (c). Three experimental results above consider the number of
    trust updating times in every level of WSN, and the network load increases based
    on augmenting the number of data-generation nodes. Download : Download high-res
    image (623KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The comparison of three
    schemes. Fig. 5 (d) shows a total number of trust updating times in a shorter
    test time. From these experimental results, we can get three pieces of information.
    (1) For the aperiodic update, the number of trust update times gradually increases
    with more random nodes selected to transmit data. (2) For the periodic update,
    it maintains a steady state. However, there is a slight reduction from 6 to 24
    on the x -axis, the reason is that the direct trust update reduces the number
    of periodic update times. (3) For our design, we can get more biggish advantage
    when the updating cycle is lengthened. When the WSN gets congested, the network
    transmission capacity decreases and the number of trust updating times increases
    due to frequent routing failures. Compared with the periodic update, our design
    can save network energy and maintain network performance by reducing the number
    of periodic update times. 5.2. The detect speed of malicious nodes There is no
    need for too frequent trust updating, for internal attacks occurs in a special
    time and frequent updating will occupy more transmission and computing resources.
    We compare the detect speed of malicious nodes between our design and the periodic
    update. Malicious nodes can be detected from two parts, the wireless sensor network
    layer and the fog layer. Because the delay time in the fog layer is slightly longer
    than that in the wireless network layer, the malicious nodes detection in the
    fog layer is introduced as an aided detection. The detect speed of the periodic
    update is shown in Fig. 6 (a), and Fig. 6 (b) shows the detect speed of our design.
    In the experiment, we separately placed malicious nodes in different levels of
    network when initializing, which spend more time than in the process of mechanism
    running. Experiment results show that the detect speed of malicious nodes gets
    faster with the increasing of network load except for the outermost layer, because
    the trust state of nodes is updated more frequently when the network load gets
    larger. In Fig. 6 (c), we randomly place malicious nodes in three levels that
    indicates a more intuitive downward trend. Even though there are some delay problems
    in detect speed, we can take advantage of Fog Computing to get the whole trust
    state of WSNs through some data analyses, such as the hidden data attack detection
    and the anomaly detection of monitor values. Download : Download high-res image

    5.3. The recovery of misjudgment nodes The service capabilities of nodes may fluctuate
    with the change of environment and themself electricity consumption. So some nodes
    show unusual behaviors in some cases, such as the biggest change of environment,
    low battery and transient fault. Almost all trust mechanisms do not consider these
    cases, we solve these problems in the fog layer by data analysis. This experiment
    scene is that the number of data-generation nodes is 18 in one communication cycle,
    and we add one kind of condition every five communication cycles after the network
    is initialized. As shown as Fig. 7, there are some malicious nodes added to network
    when initializing at (1). After six communication cycles, the periodic update
    and our design find malicious nodes at the same time. We add general malicious
    nodes at (2). After (2), malicious nodes are detected by both trust mechanisms
    after a fewer of communication cycles. The cleanup program of malicious nodes
    is executed at (3) and the environment is changed at (4). After the change of
    environment, nodes that are sensitive to environment show abnormal behaviors which
    can be misjudged as malicious nodes. During this period, there are no malicious
    nodes actually. For these misjudgment nodes, the fog layer analyzes whether these
    nodes are true malicious nodes by trust tables, recommendation trust tables, network
    topology and long-term sensor data. After an acceptable delay, our scheme can
    recover misjudgment nodes before the cleanup program at (5). Download : Download

    of misjudgment nodes. 5.4. The selection for SSPs For T r u s t s e r v i c e
    , it can be get by comparing real-time monitor values and standard negotiation
    values. For T r u s t W S N s , it can be calculated based on some exception records
    that is discovered and recorded by the fog layer. For the calculation of T r u
    s t S S P s , we will introduce it with a concrete example, such as one CSP wants
    to select SSPs that can provide with integrality and precision. Before the calculation
    of T r u s t S S P s , there is some scoring mechanisms, such as score drops one
    grade when service parameters are one less than requirement service parameters.
    In Table 2, we only display some important parameters that is shown as an example.
    The service requirement stores service parameter records of CSP who has required
    these service parameters in a past transaction. The interaction record stores
    SSPs and their trust values, which have provided data to the CSP. The recommendation
    record stores CSPs that have received recommendation services from the CSP. The
    number of accepted stores the number of accepted recommendations and total recommendations.
    The check-in time stores the existence time of the CSP in the fog layer. Table

    Interaction record Recommendation record Number of accepted Check-in time CSP1

    SSP2 (70) SSP3 (70) SSP4 (82) CSP3 CSP4 32/33 1 Firstly, the fog layer selects
    service records that are in the acceptable time range as shown as Table 2, where
    integrality and timeliness are in different sizes of service requirement sets,
    such as s e t 1 : ( C S P 1 , C S P 2 ) , s e t 2 : ( C S P 3 , C S P 4 ) , s
    e t 3 : ( C S P 5 ) . There are some potential matchup relationship that is SSPs
    and their advantages in the bracket. (1) SSP1 (no tampering, integrality). (2)
    SSP2 (integrality, timeliness). (3) SSP3 (no tampering, timeliness). (4) SSP4
    (no tampering, integrality, precision). (5) SSP5 (integrality, timeliness). Secondly,
    R g e n e r a l performs. In the calculation of R g e n e r a l , every SSPs’
    average trust value is calculated in different sets, such as [SSP1(60), SSP2(90.5),
    SSP4(96.5), SSP5(92)] in set1, [SSP1(84), SSP3(71), SSP4(93), SSP5(82)] in set2
    and [SSP1(77.5), SSP2(70), SSP3(70), SSP4(82)] in set3. The trust value of one
    SSP in smaller set should be great than or equal to that in larger set. So, we
    can find some abnormal evaluation by this rule, such as CSP1 may is a wrong selection.
    Thirdly, R s i m i l a r performs. After abnormal recommender are removed, the
    optimal choice is considered, such as familiarity, popularity and risk. The familiarity
    is influenced by recommendation records, location of SSPs and reputation. The
    popularity refers to the accepted number of one CSP’s recommendations. The risk
    focuses on whether it takes some losses if a young recommender is selected. For
    an example, CSP3 has more recommendation services than CSP2, and its number of
    accepted recommendations is larger than CSP2. Moreover, CSP3 stays in the fog
    layer for a more long time that show it more credible than CSP2. Finally, final
    recommenders are chosen. 5.5. The selection for CSPs For the selection for CSPs,
    its information record table is similar to the selection for SSPs, which also
    contains the service requirement, the interaction record, the recommendation record,
    the number of accepted and check-in time. For T r u s t s e r v i c e 1 , it also
    is generated by the fog layer based on the comparison between monitored service
    parameters and standard service parameters. For T r u s t S S P s , the process
    of selection is the similar to that of SSPs. 6. Conclusion SCS becomes more and
    more popular among many places, and its security issues have been concerned all
    the time. The traditional security mechanism cannot effectively deal with internal
    attacks, especially in the SCS underlying structure. There is also lack of a sufficiently
    trusted third party to establish the trust relationship between SSPs and CSPs.
    We design a fog-based hierarchical trust mechanism to make well up for these deficiencies
    and solve resource consumption problems in WSNs, whose the behavior trust among
    nodes is established in the wireless sensor networks layer and the data trust
    of nodes and entities is established in the fog layer. Through a more granular
    data analysis in the fog layer, we can monitor the whole network trust state,
    detect data attacks and recover misjudgment nodes. Moreover, the fog layer can
    be built as a credible third party. The experiment results show that our trust
    mechanism has some advantages in some respects, such as reducing energy consumption,
    ensuring the trust state of edge nodes and network, detecting some hidden data
    attacks and recovering misjudgment nodes. Acknowledgments Above work was supported

    Precision agriculture is a suitable solution to these challenges such as shortage
    of food, deterioration of soil properties and water scarcity. The developments
    of modern information technologies and wireless communication technologies are
    the foundations for the realization of precision agriculture. This paper attempts
    to find suitable, feasible and practical wireless communication technologies for
    precision agriculture by analyzing the agricultural application scenarios and
    experimental tests. Three kinds of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) architecture,
    which is based on narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT), Long Range (LoRa) and
    ZigBee wireless communication technologies respectively, are presented for precision
    agriculture applications. The feasibility of three WSN architectures is verified
    by corresponding tests. By measuring the normal communication time, the power
    consumption of three wireless communication technologies is compared. Field tests
    and comprehensive analysis show that ZigBee is a better choice for monitoring
    facility agriculture, while LoRa and NB-IoT were identified as two suitable wireless
    communication technologies for field agriculture scenarios. Similar content being

    Applied to Intelligent Agriculture Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction According to
    Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the world’s population
    is estimated to reach 9.2 billion by 2050. Moreover, the alarming scarcity of
    water resources, decrease of arable lands and declining agricultural labor force.
    Under the serious conditions, it is not an easy task to feed the ever-growing
    population. Various technologies such as sensor technology, information and communications
    technology (ICT), information processing technology, geographic information systems
    (GIS), environment-friendly farming through flexible fertilization technology,
    and information management are integrated and thus productivity is guaranteed,
    even with a small labor force [1,2,3]. In the recent past, these technologies
    mentioned above have been playing an important role in promoting innovation in
    the agriculture sector, and the concept of precision agriculture (PA) is formed
    [3, 4]. In order to optimize production and maximize profitability by accounting
    for variability and uncertainties while potentially reducing usage of fertilizer
    and environmental impacts, a set of techniques, such as perception, transmission,
    storage, process and control, are applied in PA. These techniques are combined
    and formed intelligent perception system, wireless communication system, intelligent
    process and control system. The systems work together to decide which, where,
    when and how to use sensors and actuators, and thus the precise control for a
    greenhouse or a field is realized [5]. Sensors placed in greenhouses or fields
    allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as variables such as soil and
    ambient temperature, atmospheric humidity, soil electric conductivity (EC) and
    PH level, luminance, etc. These data can be transmitted through Wireless Sensor
    Networks and analyzed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) system; AI system gives
    the corresponding methodologies to actuators to satisfy the specific conditions
    for crop growths. Farmers could use their smartphones to remotely monitor their
    crops and equipment and to make reasonable decisions. These are the meaning of
    PA and its technical realization [6]. There is no doubt that PA offers a solution
    to these challenges such as population growth, shortage of food, deterioration
    of soil properties and water scarcity. Furthermore, PA can also minimize the wastage
    of pesticides to effectively control pests, diseases, and weeds and ensure that
    crops receive sufficient nutrients, thereby leading to an efficient, green and
    sustainable agriculture. As we described above, the implementation of PA involves
    many modern information technologies. In order to combine modern communication
    technology effectively with PA, we must first understand the characteristics of
    agriculture and understand the application scene of modern communication technology
    in agriculture. This article focuses on the wireless communication technologies
    used in PA, highlighting the communication distance, power consumption and other
    issues. In the actual application of wireless communication technologies to precision
    agriculture in the process of information transmission, these are the main considerations
    and other issues. Through the analysis of several kinds of wireless communication
    technologies and agricultural application scenes, this paper tries to find feasible
    and practical wireless communication technologies for PA applications. Typical
    application scenes of agriculture generally include two situations: field agriculture
    and facility agriculture. Field agriculture is characterized by its wide geographical
    scope and complex terrain. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate large-scale
    field data in the field environment, problems such as the deployment mode of sensors,
    power consumption of sensor nodes, transmission distance, and data transmission
    mode of nodes must be fully considered [7]. In addition, maintainability and feasibility
    must also be considered. Compared with field agriculture, the facility agriculture
    has the characteristics of small area and flat terrain, and the key issues considered
    under this condition are power consumption and transmission distance. Data collected
    by field sensors are generally small, whether in field agriculture or facility
    agriculture (greenhouses), and the requirements for real-time transmission are
    low. Therefore, the wireless communication technologies suitable for precision
    agriculture have the characteristics of long distance (for field agriculture),
    low data volume, insensitive delay, low power consumption, and large number of
    connections. In recent years, there have been some literatures on the application
    of ZigBee and LoRa communication technologies to agriculture [8, 9], and narrowband
    internet of things (NB-IoT), the latest technology emerging in low power wide
    area (LPWA), has so far rarely been used in agriculture domain. In this paper,
    the basic framework of NB-IoT technology applied to agriculture is proposed, and
    a NB-IoT based precision agricultural system is developed. In order to compare
    the applicability of these three kinds of communication technologies in agriculture
    from the aspects of system structure, technical characteristics and realization,
    this paper also presents ZigBee and LoRa based precision agricultural application
    systems. The other contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. There’s
    a lot of literature on the application of wireless communication technologies
    to PA domain. This paper summarizes the literatures according to the communication
    distance of the wireless communication technologies used in these literatures.
    The communication technologies suitable for agricultural application are analyzed
    from the aspects of communication distance, power consumption. In addition, through
    comparison, the prospects and challenges of existing communication technologies
    applied in PA field are analyzed. In this paper, the normal communication time
    is used as an index to measure the power consumption of different communication
    technologies. This method is different from the traditional one. Compared with
    the traditional method, this method has the advantages of intuition and easy measurement.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2, we introduce a collection
    of wireless communication technologies and make a comprehensive comparison of
    these communication technologies. The purpose of the comparison is to find out
    the wireless communication technologies suitable for precision agriculture. Section
    3 reviews related works in PA domain. Information Technologies applied in PA are
    reviewed, including Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the capabilities and
    potential of cloud, edge and fog computing paradigms in these scenarios. Section
    4, three WSNs, which is based on NB-IoT, LoRa, and ZigBee wireless communication
    technologies, are presented respectively and explained in detail. Section 5, the
    feasibility of three types of WSN is verified and the power consumption of NB-IoT,
    LoRa, and ZigBee is compared. Finally, conclusions are provided in Sect. 6. 2
    An Overview of Wireless Communication Technologies With the development of information
    technology, many wireless communication technologies have been proposed for a
    variety of applications [10, 11]. Generally, these technologies are divided into
    three categories according to the transmission distance, as shown in Fig. 1, namely
    short-distance wireless communication technologies (distance ≤ 10 m), medium-distance
    wireless communication technologies (distance ranges from 10 m to 100 m) and long-distance
    wireless communication technologies (distance ≥ 100 m). Typical short-range wireless
    communication technologies include radio-frequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth
    [12], ultra-wideband (UWB), etc. Wi-Fi [13] and ZigBee [14] are two major medium-distance
    wireless communication technologies. For long-range wireless communication technologies,
    in addition to the well-known cellular networks (2G/3G/4G), LPWA is a new type
    of technology with a wide scenarios of application. In the past few years, several
    LPWA technologies like LoRa [15], NB-IoT [16] and Sigfox [17] have emerged. In
    contrast to classical long-range wireless communication technologies (2G/3G/4G),
    LPWA technologies feature low power consumption, low data rate, deep/wide coverage
    and massive connections. Therefore, LPWA technologies cannot be used for audio
    or video data streaming, but is perfectly suited for connecting devices that only
    need to transmit tiny amounts of data over a long range, while maintaining long
    battery life. The better performance of LPWA technologies, such as long transmission
    distance and low power consumption, are at the expense of low data rate and high
    latency. So, the typical application scenarios for LPWA technologies are delay
    tolerant, do not need high data rates, low power consumption and low cost. Fig.
    1 Range and rate comparisons among wireless communication technologies Full size
    image Among the wireless communication technologies mentioned above, Bluetooth,
    Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa, and NB-IoT are among the most popular ones. We briefly describe
    them below and provide a comprehensive comparison in Table 1. Table 1 Comparison
    of different wireless communication technologies Full size table From the above
    introduction and the comparison presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1, if power consumption
    is a critical factor, then Bluetooth is the best technology. Its main drawback
    is the limited communication range. The other eligible choice is the ZigBee technology,
    which offers a communication range of 100 m with 250 kbps data rate and transmission
    power consumption of about 39.6 mw. If data rate is not as important as both long
    range and low power consumption, the most attractive technology is the two kinds
    of LPWA technologies (LoRa and NB-IoT). They offer more than a 15 km communication
    range at acceptable rate with about 100 mw power consumption at transmission.
    3 Related Work The development of sensor technologies, wireless communication
    technologies and remote sensing technologies provide the possibility for the implementation
    of PA. In order to improve crop yields and quality, the transmission of some of
    the necessary field information in the crop growing environment to information
    processing centers through wireless communication technology is the basis for
    the efficient use of limited agricultural resources and the development of precision
    agriculture. In this paper, the literatures on wireless communication technologies
    for precision agriculture are divided into three categories. That is, the literatures
    on short distance, medium distance and long distance wireless communication technologies
    for precision agriculture. 3.1 Applications of Short-Distance Wireless Communication
    Technologies in Agriculture There are two kinds of short-distance wireless communication
    technologies used in precision agriculture: Bluetooth wireless protocol and RFID.
    The Bluetooth wireless protocol is used to establish a communication link between
    movable and portable devices over a short range of up to 10 m. A Bluetooth based
    greenhouse information acquisition system was designed in [18] to monitor relative
    humidity and temperature in greenhouse. Compared with the traditional data acquisition
    system, the developed information acquisition system has the advantages of convenient
    installation and simple maintenance. Based on soil and weather information, a
    Bluetooth module based integrated irrigation control system for greenhouse was
    developed in [19], which improved the leaf number, height of red and romaine lettuce
    in greenhouses, and also had the advantages of saving water and electricity. Using
    Global Positioning System (GPS) and low-cost Bluetooth wireless communication
    technologies, the smart system in [20] was developed for irrigation application
    to save water and increase farmland productivity through remote monitoring of
    weather information, soil information and sprinkler position. In order to make
    better use of the increasingly scarce water resources, several intelligent APPs
    [21, 22] based on smart-phone Bluetooth protocol were developed, these APPs have
    the advantages of low power consumption and ease of use for farmers. WSNs based
    on the Bluetooth wireless protocol have been widely used in different fields to
    monitor different equipment status, parameters and encoding equipment communication
    [23,24,25]. The applications of RFID in agriculture are many and varied. The most
    common applications include livestock identification or traceability control.
    Combining with RFID technology and mobile networking, a platform for livestock
    management based on RFID-enabled mobile devices is introduced in [26]. The platform
    uses RFID tags to store animal information that can be used to identify the animal
    in case it gets lost, or even recognize some basic information about it. [27]
    summarizes the literature of application of RFID in agriculture and discusses
    its limitations and challenges. In order to build virtual organizations of agents
    that can communicate between each other while monitoring crops, The authors [28]
    designed a system for collecting heterogeneous information by means of several
    short-distance wireless communication methods (RFID, Bluetooth), using sensors
    such as temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, humidity and wind. 3.2 Applications
    of Medium Distance Wireless Communication Technology in Agriculture The applications
    of medium distance wireless communication technologies in agriculture mainly include
    Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n) and ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4 standard). In
    agricultural applications, Wi-Fi extends the use of heterogeneous architectures
    that connect multiple-type devices through an ad-hoc network. An example of a
    WSN-based monitoring system using IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n transceivers was presented
    in [29]. The system monitors parameters such as temperature and soil moisture
    and performs irrigation calculations based on field data and rules-based knowledge
    to make the best decision. A Wi-Fi based remote monitoring system, which attempts
    to minimize wiring connections, lower cost, and enhance the mobility and flexibility
    of the sensing nodes in WSN, is proposed for agricultural application in [30].
    The climate conditions of the agricultural field or greenhouse, such as temperature,
    humidity, light, water level, and soil moisture, are monitored. In [31], the WSN
    nodes collect field data through soil and environmental sensors (such as soil
    moisture sensors, soil temperature sensor, environmental temperature sensor, environmental
    humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, and sunlight intensity sensor, etc). The field data
    were stored in a gateway then transmitted to the server computer via the Wi-Fi
    network for the prediction of soil moisture content. ZigBee technology offers
    a long battery life, smaller size, higher reliability, and thus, is very suitable
    for agricultural applications such as the intelligent control of irrigation, fertilizer
    and pesticide. Given the low duty cycle, ZigBee technology is considered one of
    the best candidates in agriculture. There are three main applications of ZigBee
    technology in agriculture: intelligent irrigation control, greenhouse monitoring,
    and livestock monitoring. According to the different demands of soil moisture
    and pH value of crops, a ZigBee and GPRS based multi-functional intelligent water
    management system was developed [32], and the whole system was powered by solar
    panels. Several types of sensor, such as air temperature sensor, soil humidity
    sensor, soil nutrient sensor etc., were used to collect real-time data in [33];
    these sensors connect with the Internet of things intelligent gateway by CC2530
    ZigBee modules based wireless network. A combination of artificial intelligence
    with ZigBee based WSN for greenhouse climate control was presented in [8]. This
    combination was proved effective methods in term of cost, energy, productivity
    and flexibility. In order to accurately collect real-time agricultural data in
    large-field environment, a ZigBee based farmland environment monitoring system
    was designed in [34]. The system solved the problems of complex wiring, high cost
    and short communication range in large-field environment monitoring. By comparing
    ZigBee technology with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, [35] made an explorative application
    of ZigBee technology in greenhouse, and proposed a greenhouse monitoring and control
    system. In order to achieve scientific cultivation and reduce management costs,
    a low-cost and practical greenhouse monitoring system was developed in [36]. Several
    key environmental parameters (temperature, humidity and illumination) were collected
    by sensors and transmitted through ZigBee-based WSNs. A low power and low cost
    cattle location system was presented in [37]. The cattle location in grazing fields
    was determined by the link quality indication of the ZigBee links. A high performance
    ZigBee-based ad hoc WSN has been used to monitor the behavior of a flock in [38],
    five types of animal behavior can be classified by this method. 3.3 Applications
    of Long-Distance Wireless Communication Technologies in Agriculture According
    to different power consumption and transmission rate, we divide the long-distance
    wireless communication technologies applied in agriculture into two categories,
    the one is high data rate and high power consumption (2G/3G/4G), and the other
    is low data rate and low power consumption. The authors [39] use Code Division
    Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless communication to realize long-distance and real-time
    information transmission. Multiple parameters for farmland, such as chlorophyll
    content of crop leaves, air temperature, air humidity, and light intensity, are
    collected. Plant growth information and environmental information are transmitted
    to the information processing center to realize remote monitoring of crop state
    and environmental conditions. Using General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) module
    and WSN, an automatic crop irrigation system, which based on information collected
    by distributed soil moisture and temperature sensors installed at the root zone
    of plants, was developed [40]. Up to 90% water savings achieved compared with
    traditional irrigation practices in agricultural. Similar GPRS application can
    be found in [41]. Focusing on solving the problem of high energy consumption in
    3G open watering system, the authors presented a low-energy and long-range system
    over LoRa [42]. To meet the need for monitoring greenhouse environmental parameters
    with high power efficiency, a LoRa wireless protocol based star topology network
    was constructed [9]. The network may communicate with a cloud server over a long
    range and with 90% power efficiency. A remote three-level hierarchical monitoring
    system was designed to collect all possible information on the environmental conditions
    surrounding the beehives [43]. The monitoring system was formed by LoRa wireless
    nodes, a local data server, and a cloud data server. From the literatures mentioned
    above, we can see that wireless communication technologies suitable for PA needs
    to have characteristics such as long range, low power consumption, large number
    of connections, and low cost. Combining the comparison in Table 1, the ZigBee
    and LPWA (LoRa, and NB-IoT) have been identified as the most suitable wireless
    communication technologies for PA applications because of their low power consumption,
    long communication range (acceptable for ZigBee and long for LPWA), easy network
    implementation. 4 Application Architecture The IoT-based precise agriculture is
    to establish a system that uses sensors (temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture,
    etc.), modern information transmission and processing technologies to monitor
    the crop field and intellectualize farmland management. WSN play the role of connecting
    data collection and processing throughout the system [2]. The system architecture
    of IoT-based precise agriculture, as illustrated in Fig. 2, consists of three
    parts, which are of “things” (sensors/actuators or end-devices), local gateways
    (or base stations), and the network server (or cloud server). Usually, “Things”
    have the function of field data collection and control. The IoT-based solutions
    have “things” controlled and managed using data locally and/or connected to local
    gateways (or base stations) that provide extended functionality. However, most
    existing “things” were not specifically designed to connect to the Internet and
    cannot directly exchange data with the network server (or cloud server). To solve
    the problem between “things” and server, gateway acts as intermediaries for them,
    providing the required connectivity, interactivity, and security. The network
    server provides data storage, management, analysis and processing services, as
    well as information support for intelligent decision making. Fig. 2 The system
    architecture of IoT-based precise agriculture Full size image To identify the
    performance of the NB-IoT, LoRa and ZigBee standards for monitoring farmlands,
    three kinds of WSNs were implemented. In the next parts, based on the wireless
    communication technologies of NB-IoT, LoRa and ZigBee, we will present communication
    networks for precision agriculture respectively, so that the characteristics of
    the three networks can be clearly compared. 4.1 NB-IoT Based WSN for Precision
    Agriculture An application framework of NB-IoT for PA is shown in Fig. 3. The
    framework consists of three components, that is, NB-IoT terminals, transmission
    networks and application server. They perform functions such as data collection,
    data transmission, data analysis and decision-making respectively. Various environmental
    sensors and NB-IoT modules form the NB-IoT terminals to complete the function
    of field data collection. Sensors are used to collect environmental data, and
    then the collected environment data is transmitted to the NB-IoT modules through
    the RS485 bus; Data transmission network consists of NB-IoT network and Internet
    network. Sensing data from the NB-IoT terminals are transmitted to the Internet
    network via the NB-IoT network; the tasks of the application server include receiving,
    saving, and visualizing data, and then make reasonable decision based on data
    analysis. This process can also be summarized as follows. NB-IoT terminals (including
    various environmental sensors and NB-IoT communication modules) transmit sensing
    data to transmission network. The data then are relayed forward and stored to
    application servers. Fig. 3 The application architecture of NB-IoT for precise
    agriculture Full size image In contrast, the commands issued by users to end actuators
    are transmitted through application servers, transmission network, and NB-IoT
    terminals. After receiving the control commands, the end actuators will execute
    them and return the execution results to the application servers. 4.2 LoRa Based
    WSN for Precision Agriculture A LoRa based WSN, as shown in Fig. 4, is presented.
    Three different types of components are included in the star-topology network:
    end-devices, gateways and network server. The end-devices consist of sensors/actuators,
    LoRa transceiver and LoRa receiver. Their main function is to upload the sensing
    data to the gateway through LoRa transmitter, or to receive command message from
    the gateway through LoRa receiver. Gateways are the intermediate between the end-devices
    and network server; in other words, gateways are only bidirectional relays, or
    protocol converters. Gateways forward raw data frames from the end-devices to
    the network server over an Ethernet backhaul interface with higher throughput.
    The network server is responsible for copying and decoding sensing packets sent
    by the end-devices or generating decision-making packets that should be sent back
    to the end-devices. Unlike cellular based NB-IoT networks, the end-devices in
    a LoRa network are not associated with a specific gateway in order to have access
    to the network, that is, the same packet can be received (or forwarded) by more
    than one LoRa gateway. Fig. 4 The application architecture of LoRa for precise
    agriculture Full size image 4.3 ZigBee Based WSN for Precision Agriculture The
    ZigBee network has three topological structures, namely, star, tree, and mesh.
    Compared with the other two, the tree topology has the advantages of high connectivity
    and low routing overhead, and is more suitable for farmland periodic monitoring
    and other applications. The ZigBee-based tree networking topology, presented in
    Fig. 5, represents a high reliability, energy-efficient and low-cost solution
    that has extensively been used in agriculture for monitoring different environmental
    and soil parameters. In this tree topology network, there are three types of node
    that can be configured: end-device, router and coordinator. Their configuration
    is done by ZigBee Module Configure shown in Fig. 6. The collected data (such as
    air temperature, air humidity, and soil moisture) from the sensors and end-devices
    are firstly transmitted wirelessly to coordinator via the routers; and then relay
    to network server by GPRS way. Fig. 5 The application architecture of ZigBee for

    of area nearly 12 square meters. The purpose of the field tests is two. The first
    one is to test the feasibility of the above three application frameworks, especially
    for the feasibility of the latest LPAW technology NB-IoT application architecture.
    Secondly, the power consumption of three kinds of wireless communication technologies
    is compared. 5.1 The Feasibility Tests The feasibility of NB-IoT based application
    architecture, as shown in Fig. 3, is first tested. The NB-IoT module we select
    is BC95-B5 of Quectel, with 850 MHz frequency band. Low-cost STM32 is selected
    as a controller. The sensors collect environmental and soil data, which include
    ambient temperature, atmospheric humidity, luminance, and soil moisture and temperature,
    every half an hour and transmit them to the application server via the NB-IoT
    network. Figure 7 shows the values obtained on the field testing for 24 h. Fig.
    7 The daily testing curve obtained by NB-IoT based WSN Full size image In the
    following tests, the WSNs shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are simultaneously used to
    collect environmental and soil data. The ZigBee modules we select are CC2630 of
    TI Company. The development board with Semtech SX1278 is used as the end-devices.
    Figure 8 shows the average daily data that are provided by the field sensors for
    13 days. All the five sub-figures in Fig. 8 show that there is little variation
    between the data within the same time period. The testing results demonstrate
    the feasibility of the three kinds of WSNs. Fig. 8 Average daily data collected
    on the field Full size image 5.2 Comparison of Power Consumption Power consumption
    is the power consumed by communication equipment per unit time. Under the condition
    that the total power supply is determined, the normal communication time of communication
    equipment can be used as an indicator to measure the power consumption of communication
    equipment. The longer the normal communication time is, the lower the power consumption
    is. The purpose of the test is to compare the power consumption of three wireless
    communication technologies (ZigBee, LoRa and NB-IoT). In an open environment,
    the power consumption of three communication technologies at different communication
    distances is tested. The testing topology is shown in Fig. 9. For ZigBee communication
    technology, longer communication distances are provided by routing relay, as shown
    in Fig. 9a. For NB-IoT and LoRa, communication distance is changed by adjusting
    the distance between the terminal and the gateway, as shown in Fig. 9b, and no
    relay is required. The adjustable distance depends on testing requirements. Fig.
    9 Topology for power consumption tests. a Test for ZigBee communication technology.
    b Test for LoRa and NB-IoT communication technologies Full size image Unlike traditional
    methods, the following tests use normal communication time as a measure of power
    consumption. In the case of a certain communication distance and a certain battery
    capacity, the end-devices/terminals continuously send data until the server cannot
    get data normally due to the exhaustion of the end-devices/terminals battery.
    The normal communication time can be regard as a token of the corresponding power
    consumption. The longer normal communication time, the lower power consumption,
    and vice versa. Figure 10 illustrates the duration of the normal communications
    for the three wireless communication technologies when the testing distance is
    50 m, 100 m, 150 m, and 500 m, respectively. ZigBee wireless communication technology
    has the smallest power consumption among the three wireless communication technologies,
    while the other two wireless communication technologies (LoRa and NB-IoT) have
    approximately the same power consumption, about three times as much as ZigBee
    wireless communication technologies. Fig. 10 Comparison of normal communication
    time of three topological structures Full size image 6 Conclusions The development
    of communication technologies has provided the possibilities for their application
    in the field of PA. By analyzing and summarizing the characteristics of agricultural
    application scenes and experimental tests, this paper tries to find the wireless
    communication technologies suitable for PA application. Wireless communication
    technologies suitable for PA have the characteristics of low power consumption,
    long distance, large connection volume, and low cost. From the above discussion
    and the experimental results presented in Figs. 7, 8 and 9, the NB-IoT, ZigBee
    and LoRa wireless communication technologies have been identified as the most
    suitable communication technologies for PA applications. If power consumption
    is the critical consideration, ZigBee is the best technology. The main drawback
    of ZigBee is its limited coverage. Therefore, ZigBee is a better choice for monitoring
    and control of facility agriculture (greenhouse) than two other communication
    technologies. If coverage distances are more than 5 km, the available choice is
    LPWA (NB-IoT and LoRa) technology. They offer more than a 15 km cover range at
    acceptable throughput with smaller power consumption at transmission. The main
    drawback of NB-IoT technology is the monthly subscription costs, which need to
    be paid to the provider, meanwhile the main drawback of LoRa technology is maintenance
    costs. References Navarro-Hellín, H., Martínez-del-Rincon, J., Domingo-Miguel,

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

  limitations: IoT-based water management systems can be highly responsive to changing
    environmental conditions, improving irrigation efficiency and reducing water usage.
    However, these systems are not without limitations.  IoT-based systems rely on
    sensors to collect data, but the accuracy and reliability of these sensors can
    be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and dust.
    Additionally, IoT systems can be complex and expensive to install and maintain,
    making them impractical for some farmers.  In some cases, IoT-based systems may
    not be able to account for local conditions such as soil type, crop variety, and
    climate, which can lead to suboptimal irrigation practices.
  methodology: Data collection involves identifying important criteria in research
    articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the agriculture and farming sectors.
    As shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used to analyse relevant research
    papers.  In particular, 60 peer-reviewed scientific publications on IoT in the
    agriculture and farming sectors published in scientific journals between 2016
    and 2018 were used.

    150 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The large deployment of Internet of things
    (IoT) is actually enabling smart city projects and initiatives all over the world.
    Objects used in daily life are being equipped with electronic devices and protocol
    suites in order to make them interconnected and connected to the Internet. According
    to a recent Gartner study, 50 billion connected objects will be deployed in smart
    cities by 2020. These connected objects will make the authors’ cities smart. However,
    they will also open up risks and privacy issues. As various smart city initiatives
    and projects have been launched in recent years, theyhave witnessed not only the
    expected benefits, but the risks introduced. They describe the current and future
    trends of smart city and IoT. They also discuss the interaction between smart
    cities and IoT and explain some of the drivers behind the evolution and development
    of IoT and smart city. Finally, they discuss some of the IoT weaknesses and how
    they can be addressed when used for smart cities. 1 Introduction As cities grow
    and expand, smart and innovative solutions are crucial for improving productivity,
    increasing operational efficiencies and reducing management costs [1]. Citizens
    are gradually equipping their homes with Internet of things (IoT) devices such
    as TV and Internet box. In the real estate sector, connected objects include thermostats,
    smart alarms, smart door locks and other systems and appliances. At the United
    Nations conference on climate change (Cop21) held in Paris in 2016, connected
    objects were extensively addressed and gave to many local communities the opportunity
    to rethink their environmental objectives in order to reduce their carbon dioxide
    (CO2) emissions through the use of IoT[http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cop21-can-the-internet-of-things-improve-organizations-sustainability-performance/]
    [http://www.cloud-experience.fr/cop21-le-role-des-tic/]. The latter can play a
    vital role in the context of smart cities. For example, intelligent waste containers
    can bring real benefits to citizens; they will be able to indicate that they are
    soon going to be full and must be emptied. Citizens can check through a smart
    phone application if the waste containers in the street are full or not. Also,
    after waste containers reports their status, companies can offer route optimisation
    solution to the teams responsible for garbage collection. Places can be equipped
    with sensors and monitor environmental conditions, cyclists or athletes can find
    the most ‘healthy’ trips and the city can respond by adjusting the traffic or
    by planting more trees in some areas. The data will be accessible to all citizens
    to promote the creation of applications using real-time information for residents.
    Cities have become hubs for knowledge sharing. The technologies and solutions
    needed for creating smart cities are just beginning to emerge. Fig. 1 describes
    an example of a smart city. Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Development
    of smart cities (CISCO Copyright 2014) Gartner has reported [2] that the investment
    in IoT will be crucial to build smart cities, services as data using will generate
    most of the revenues. Safety and security of smart homes will be the second largest
    market in terms of service revenues. As for services related to health and well-being,
    they should represent a market of $38 billion in 2020 [2]. A practical solution
    must find the trade-offs between effectiveness and privacy risks. A sophisticated
    attacker could, for example, take control of various intelligent devices such
    as lights, cameras, traffic lights, connected cars and many other smart devices
    in cities. With over 50 billion devices connected by 2020, municipalities will
    be very much concerned for the safety of their intelligent cities [2, 3]. However,
    solutions to address safety, security and privacy concerns of smart cities relying
    on diverse intelligent objects fall not only into the technology realm, but also
    in other areas including sociology, legal and policy management. In this chapter,
    we present an overview of IoT in the context of smart cities, and we discuss how
    IoT can enhance a city''s smartness. We also identify the weaknesses and risks
    associated with IoT deployment and adoption in the smart city environment. In
    the next section, we present some background information on IoT and smart city.
    Section 3 discusses the main architectures used within IoT. Section 4 describes
    how IoT can be considered as an enabling technology for smart city. In Section
    4.2.8, we describe the weaknesses that need to be addressed when IoT is used for
    smart cities. Finally, in the last section, we make some concluding remarks. 2
    IoT and smart city In the recent literature, several authors have provided definitions
    for the term IoT [4-6]. IoT may be defined as ‘Objects having identities and virtual
    personalities in smart spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect and communicate
    within social, medical, environmental and users context [7]’. Huge investments
    are currently being made in the IoT area to support the delivery of a wide range
    of services. Various aspects of social and economic life are currently being studied
    for IoT. Trust in IoT implies that investors do not hesitate to commit to it financially;
    100 million € were invested by large corporations such as Telefónica, SKTelecom,
    NTT Docomo Ventures, Elliott Management Corporation and industry groups GDF SUEZ,
    Air Liquide for research and development of IoT. The deployment of IoT needs communication
    standards that seamlessly operate among the various objects. Several worldwide
    organisations are involved in standardising such communications. These include
    the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Institute of Electrical and
    Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Global
    Standard1 (GS1), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
    Standards (OASIS), the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and several others.
    We briefly present some of these IoT standards and initiatives in Fig. 2. For
    example, the IoT Standard Global Initiative (IoT-GSI) supported by ITU made two
    recommendations: the ITU-T Y.2060 [8], which provides an overview of the concept
    of IoT and ITU-T Y.2061 [8], which describes the conditions for the machine interface
    (MI) oriented toward applications. Various standards were proposed by IEEE and
    IETF at different levels for sensor networks based on the Internet protocol (IP).
    For example, at the link layer, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is more suitable than
    Ethernet in industrial environments. At the network level, the IPv6 over low-power
    wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) standard can adapt the IPv6 protocol
    for wireless communications [9]. In 2011, the IETF published the IPv6 routing
    protocol (RPL) standard for low-power networks. Fig. 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Main communication standards within IoT IETF has also launched a Working Group
    to standardise an application layer-oriented protocol for connected objects. The
    reference protocol is called the constrained application protocol (CoAP). CoAP
    (see RFC 7252 of June 2014) provides methods and commands [such as, hypertext
    transfer protocol (HTTP) Get] to query an object and change its status. CoAP relies
    on UDP and can optionally use Datagram Transport Layer Security, to provide communication
    security. Operating systems [10] used in IoT include: TinyOS, Contiki OS, MantisOS,
    Nano-RK, Android, Brillo (Google), Windows 10 IoT Core, LiteOS (Huawei), Mbed
    OS (ARM). In addition, several platforms [10] have been developed for IoT: Arrayent,
    Californium CoAP Java framework, Erbium, CoAP framework for Contiki and XMesh
    networking stack. At the application layer, a large number of applications have
    been developed [10]: Iobridge Thingspeak, Nimbits, Evrythng, Open.Sen.se, NanoService,
    exosite One, HP supposed, Isidorey, SensorCloud, Manybots and so on. Fig. 3 compares
    the 6lowPAN communication stack with other popular communication stacks. Fig.

    [11] The Electronic Product Code global (EPC global) initiative of the organisation
    GS1 [http://www.gs1.org] defines a unique individual identifier for identifying
    an electronic product and the overall EPC network architecture that defines the
    organisation of information systems designed to ensure the exchange of information
    in an EPC network [12, 13]. One of its main components is the object name service
    (ONS) which is based on the domain name system (DNS). In fact, in 1970 the European
    Article Numbering (EAN) standard emerged for product identification. However,
    this EAN barcode is actually used to identify a class of products, not individual
    instances within this class. Furthermore, in IoT, a unique IP address for each
    connection is required. This is why EPC was proposed by GS1 as a new standard.
    Meanwhile, OASIS [www.oasis-open.org] issued various recommendations on network
    technologies in IoT and messaging technologies such as Message queue telemetry
    transport (MQTT), advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP) and the data distribution
    service (DDS) for real-time systems. In 2014, a new IIC [http://www.iiconsortium.org]
    was launched in order to coordinate and establish the priorities and enabling
    technologies of the industrial Internet. There are thousands of founding and contributing
    members of ICC and they include: Bosh, Intel, IBM, Schneider, Huawei, Cisco and
    several others. There are currently 19 Working Groups and teams working on different
    areas: Business Strategy and Solution Lifecycle, Legal, Liaison, Security, Technology
    Testbeds, Marketing and Membership and so on. Fig. 4 summarises some IoT''s protocols
    and standards and Fig. 5 details the used acronyms. Fig. 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint IoT protocol stack [14] Fig. 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Acronym
    table A smart city is defined as a city connecting physical infrastructures, Information
    Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures, social infrastructures and business
    infrastructures to leverage the collective intelligence of the city [15]. A city
    can be smart through a large deployment of IoT (especially through machine-to-machine
    and human-to-machine communications). Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the sensing-actuation
    arm of the IoT, seamlessly integrate into urban infrastructure forming a ‘digital
    skin’ around it. The information generated is shared across diverse platforms
    and applications to develop a common operating picture of the city [16]. 3 IoT
    architecture IoT technologies are expected to be part of large-scale networks,
    with the number of devices in the thousands and areas spanning several kilometres.
    In the rest of this chapter, we focus primarily on the LoRa ultra-narrowband (UNB)
    technology which was developed by Semtech and SigFox''s. 3.1 LoRa LoRa is a wireless
    technology designed to provide the low-power within wide-area networks (LPWANs)
    required for IoT services [17]. The technology offers a mix of long range, low-power
    consumption and secure data transmission. The LoRa standard has been developed
    for IoT-type devices in regional or global networks. This technology provides
    seamless interoperability among devices without requiring any complex installations.
    The services targeted include home energy monitoring, alarm systems, remote health
    monitoring, transportation, environment protection and so on. This specification
    defines the communication protocol and system architecture for the underlying
    network. It supports frequencies in the 433, 868 or 915 MHz ISM bands, depending
    on the area where it is deployed. In Europe, it uses either Gaussian frequency
    shift keying (GFSK) or the proprietary LoRa modulation system, which works with
    a version of Chirp Spread Spectrum using 125 kHz channel bandwidth[18]. LoRa architecture
    is described in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint LoRa architecture
    [20] The hierarchical star-based topology is used by LoRa networks. IoT devices
    in such networks can be servers, endpoints or gateways. Data rates can range,
    in Europe, from 0.3 to 50 kbps when channel aggregation is employed. In North
    America, the minimum data rate is 0.9 kbps because of Federal Communications Commission
    requirements. The payload for this technology can range from 2 to 255 B [19].
    This standard is optimised for low-cost and battery-operated sensors. The devices
    are asynchronous and communicate only when they have data ready to send whether
    event driven or scheduled. Power consumption is proportional to the time devices
    spent while in the listening mode. LoRa is gaining significant attention in IoT
    networks that are being deployed by wireless network operators. It can be deployed
    with minimum upfront infrastructure investments and operating costs. When increased
    network capacity is required, further Gateways can be added. It has been estimated
    that the deployment cost of this technology in unlicenced bands needs much less
    capital than even a third generation (3G) software upgrade [19]. Major telecom
    operators (e.g. Swisscom, NKE Electronics and others) are deploying this technology
    for nationwide networks because of its benefits over competing technologies. These
    benefits include bi-directional communications, mobility for asset tracking, security
    and accurate localisation [20]. 3.2 SigFox SigFox created an UNB IoT communications
    system designed to support IoT deployments over long ranges, e.g. in excess of
    20 km between a client device and a base station [http://www.sigfox.com]. SigFox
    uses licence-exempt spectrum for its product, namely the 868 MHz band in Europe
    and 915 MHz band in the USA, to transmit data over a narrow spectrum to and from
    connected objects. The UNB operation is achieved using bandwidth channels lower
    than 1 kHz transmitting data payloads of 12 B uplink and 8 B downlink with a protocol
    overhead of 26 B [19]. One of the advantages of SigFox devices is their resource
    efficiency. The power demand is negligible because devices are only ‘on’ when
    they are transmitting; this means that the power demand is a fraction of that
    for a device operating on cellular networks. SigFox technology allows deploying
    very efficient, low-throughput communications by limiting the number of antennas
    (base stations). For the same level of coverage, SigFox requires around 1000 times
    less antennas and base stations, compared with some cellular networks [http://www.atmel.com/images/atmel-9372-smart-rf-ata8520datasheet.pdf].
    This technology offers access to a service management interface, which can enable
    the control of main communication parameters such as battery and temperature settings,
    signal quality, volume of exchanged data and others [http://www.sigfox.com]. Networks
    based on SigFox technology have already connected thousands of devices in several
    international cities. They are currently operational in 14 countries, covering
    an area of more than 1.2 million km2 and reach 223 million people [http://www.iotglobalnetwork.com].
    In general, IoT can be divided into three layers: the perception layer, the network
    layer and the application layer. The perception layer is mainly used to capture
    and gather, distinguish and identify the information of objects in the physical
    world [5]. This layer includes radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, cameras,
    global positioning system (GPS), sensors, laser scanners and so on. The network
    layer is used to forward packets over a reliable communication medium. The application
    layer processes the data, aggregates various sources and displays it. Fig. 7 compares
    different low-power WAN technologies used in IoT use case scenarios. Fig. 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of low-power WAN technologies [21] 4 IoT
    as an enabling technology for smart city The IoT concept leverages several ubiquitous
    services to enable smart city deployments all over the world. IoT introduces new
    opportunities such as the capability to monitor and manage devices remotely, analyse
    and take actions based on the information received from various real-time traffic
    datastreams. As a result, IoT products are changing cities by enhancing infrastructures,
    creating more effective and cost-efficient municipal services, improving transportation
    services by decreasing road traffic congestion and improving citizens’ safety.
    To achieve the full potential of IoT, smart city architects and providers recognise
    that cities must not offer a separate smart city feature, but rather deliver scalable
    and secure IoT solutions that include efficient IoT systems. 4.1 IoT for smart
    cities: requirements and real examples An efficient smart city solution should
    design and incorporate IoT platforms that meet the requirements of today''s IoT,
    and allow the management of millions of connected devices, systems and people.
    In particular, an IoT platform should: Reduce the cost and risk required to create
    and evolve IoT services. Connect multiple heterogeneous systems in a city. Decrease
    the time required to implement and deploy IoT services which are part of smart
    city initiatives. Deliver secure and scalable service access and open up new opportunities
    for the city. Create value (e.g. better services) from smart-connected data and
    devices. IoT objects with various capabilities (e.g. temperature, light, humidity
    and pressure) have appeared today and many of them allow us to anticipate rather
    than simply react. Indeed, there are many sectors (health, manufacturing, transportation
    and others) where connected objects are being deployed. According to IDC [22],
    the Chinese IoT market is expected to reach $361 billion by 2020 with an increase
    of 13.3% over the next five years. Well known Chinese firms such as Alibaba, Baidu,
    Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi are making heavy investments in the IoT sector. Moreover,
    in the city of Zhonggnauchun, also called the ‘Chinese Silicon Valley’, located
    in the northeast of Beijing, has also attracted IoT entrepreneurs from around
    the world. In 2015, the White House launched the smart city initiative which aims
    to facilitate technological collaboration between cities, federal agencies, universities
    and the private sector [http://smartcitiescouncil.com/article/white-house-announces-160-million-smart-cities-initiative)
    (https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/26/fact-sheet-announcing-over-80-million-new-federal-investment-and].
    In the USA, Kansas City has signed an agreement with Sprint and Cisco to create
    the biggest smart city in North America with the intention of improving municipal
    services. Through a wide-area sensor network and wireless fidelity (WiFi), the
    project (worth over $15 million) will provide different types of information to
    citizens by gathering data on their behaviour in the city. Fujisawa [http://fujisawasst.com/EN/],
    a city located in the South of Tokyo, is under construction by Panasonic and 3000
    people are expected to be there by 2018. Songdo [http://songdoibd.com/] in South
    Korea is being built by Gale, a powerful USA real estate group. Songdo hopes to
    welcome about 300,000 workers and 65,000 residents by 2020. The UAE is also looking
    into the future beyond the post-oil era and had led to investments worth $18 billion
    to build Masdar (http://www.masdar.ae/), a city in the desert powered entirely
    (100%) by renewable energy. In Masdar, for example, wastewater is used to irrigate
    green spaces. The Malmo Green Digital City project (http://malmo.se/gronit) in
    Sweden aims to make Malmo a carbon neutral city by 2020. The project also aims
    to make the city run entirely on renewable energy by 2030. Malmo officials foresee
    that this city project will be able to house 10,000 people and they expect an
    additional 20,000 to work or study there. In Fujisawa, street light illuminates
    only when sensors detect the presence of an individual. Recycling is also a major
    concern. In Songdo, rainwater is collected, filtered and used to irrigate parks.
    In France, the Ministry of Transport has launched (in 2016) a project called scoop@F
    to develop an infrastructure for smart vehicles. In this project, 3000 intelligent
    vehicles will be tested in six locations including Ile-de-France, on the Bordeaux
    ring road and the Isère department. The budget of scoop@F is estimated at 20 million
    € funded between the state, communities, industrial and the EU. In this project,
    adapted vehicles driven by individuals and professionals, will be connected to
    the smart route and interconnected via WiFi, 4G or 5G technologies to share information
    among them about traffic, accident, presence of debris or an animal on the road.
    A connected car is therefore a solution that improves the driving conditions by
    collecting and disseminating real-time traffic information and traffic conditions
    among the vehicles which will improve the traffic security [23, 24]. To summarise,
    smart cities are connected cities that use telecommunication technologies and
    information systems to improve the lives of citizens. We think that a smart city
    can be made smart by achieving two principal objectives: Providing an advanced
    urban infrastructure with the ability to collect and process data using emerging
    technologies such as smart grid, smart meters, smart buildings, connected objects
    and big data in order to anticipate any anomalies. Allowing users to interact
    with the environment through smart applications in order to reduce CO2 emissions.
    Reduced pollution levels will improve the environment and ultimately the quality
    of life (e.g. improved health, safer, faster, cheaper commute) of the citizens.
    4.2 IoT applications for smart cities It is interesting to consider the application
    of the IoT paradigm to an urban context. Indeed, many national governments extensively
    are currently studying and planning how to adopt ICT solutions in the management
    of public services in order to realise smart city concept [25]. 4.2.1 Health of
    buildings To properly maintain the historical buildings of a city we need to:
    (i) continuously monitor the actual conditions of each building and (ii) to identify
    the most affected areas due to various external agents [26]. The city contains
    multiple structures, which have different sizes and different ages. It is different
    from one city to another, but, generally, most of the structures are very old
    (such as buildings, dams or bridges [27]). To assess the conditions of a building,
    passive WSNs can be embedded within a concrete structure, and periodically send
    a radio signal of suitable amplitude and phase characteristic to inform about
    the structure''s state [16]. 4.2.2 Environmental monitoring WSNs process, analyse
    and disseminate information collected from multiple environments [27]. The various
    parameters measured by sensors [28] are: Water level for lakes, streams and sewages.
    Gas concentration in the air for cities, laboratories and deposits. Soil humidity
    and other characteristics. Inclination for static structures (e.g. bridges, dams).
    Position changes (e.g. for landslides). Lighting conditions either as part of
    combined sensing or standalone (e.g. to detect intrusions in dark places). Infrared
    radiation for heat (fire) or animal detection. 4.2.3 Waste management Waste management
    becomes an increasing problem in urban living. It is related to many aspects including
    socioeconomic and environmental ones. One important feature in waste management
    is environmental sustainability [29]. A major benefit of global IoT infrastructures
    is that they provide us with the ability to collect data, and further help in
    improving effective management for various issues. Nowadays, the garbage truck
    needs to pick-up all garbage cans even when they are empty [30]. By using IoT
    devices inside the garbage can, these devices will be connected to the computing
    server using one of LPWAN technologies. The computing server can collect the information
    and optimise the way to garbage collection is performed by the garbage trucks.
    4.2.4 Smart parking In this use case, there is a wireless sensor (or connected
    object) at each parking spot. If a vehicle parks, or if a parked vehicle leaves
    a parking spot, the sensor at the parking spot sends a notification to a management
    server. By collecting information regarding the parking bay occupancy, the server
    can provide parking vacancy information to drivers through a visualisation platform
    such as smartphones, vehicles’ human–MIs (HMIs) or advertisement boards. These
    information will also enable the city council to apply fines in case of parking
    infringements [16]. RFID technology is automated and can be very useful to vehicle
    identification systems. Vehicles are identified and parking-lot fees are collected
    automatically via this system [31]. As for the hardware requirements, by utilising
    RFID readers, barriers, parking-lot check-in and check-out controls can be achieved.
    In this way, in contrast to personnel-controlled traditional parking-lot operations,
    an unmanned, automated vehicle control and identification system can be developed
    as described in [31]. The development of vehicle ad hoc networks [32] along with
    the advances and wide deployments of wireless communication technologies, many
    major car manufactories and telecommunication industries are increasingly fitting
    their cars with on-board unit communication device. This allows different cars
    to communicate with each other as well as with the roadside infrastructure. Thus,
    applications that provide information on parking space occupancy or guide drivers
    to empty parking spaces are made possible through vehicular communications [33].
    4.2.5 Smart health A wireless body AN (WBAN) which is based on a low-cost WSN
    technology could greatly benefit patient monitoring systems in hospitals, residential
    and work environments [34]. The miniature sensors can be embedded inside the body
    or mounted on the surface of the body. The sensors communicate with medical devices
    using different technologies of WPAN (ZigBee, 6LowPAN, CoAP etc.). The sensors
    are also capable of measuring various physiological parameters information (e.g.
    blood flow, respiratory rate, blood pressure, blood PH, body temperature and so
    on), which are collected and analysed by remote servers (see Fig. 8). The wearability
    requirement poses physical limitations on the design of these sensors. The sensors
    must be light, small and should not hinder a patient''s movements and mobility.
    Moreover, because the sensors need to operate on small batteries included in the
    wearable package, they need to be highly energy efficient [35]. Fig. 8 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Components of a remote patient monitoring system that
    is based on an IoT-cloud architecture [35] 4.2.6 Navigation system for urban bus
    riders UBN is based on an IoT architecture which uses a set of distributed software
    and hardware components that are tightly integrated with the bus system. The UBN
    system deployed in Madrid, Spain is composed of three key components: (i) the
    network-enabled urban bus system with WiFi equipped buses, (ii) the UBN navigation
    application for bus riders and (iii) the bus crowd information server which collects
    real-time occupancy information from buses operating on different routes in Madrid
    [36]. 4.2.7 Smart grid The smart grid uses new technologies such as intelligent
    and autonomous controllers, advanced software for data management and two-way
    communications between power utilities and consumers, to create an automated and
    distributed advanced energy delivery network (see Fig. 9) [37]. Deployed as an
    infrastructure for sensing and transmitting information for the smart grid, the
    IoT technology, when applied to the power network, will play a significant role
    in cost-effective power generation, distribution, transmission and consumption
    [38]. Fig. 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Smart grid architecture [37] 4.2.8
    Autonomous driving In a smart city, autonomous driving technologies will be synonymous
    with saving time for the user. This technology would help speed up the flow of
    traffic in a city and save almost 60% [39] of parking space by parking the cars
    closer to each other. According to Nissan–Renault, autonomous vehicles will likely
    be marketed in 2020. These ‘automatic cars’ will circulate autonomously at around
    30–50 km/h as the Renault Next two-autonomous model of the French manufacturer
    [40]. In 2017, Volvo will experiment with a hundred autonomous cars driving in
    real traffic conditions on roads in Gothenburg, London and several Chinese cities.
    Through a combination of radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors located around
    the car, an autonomous car can detect anomalies all around and trigger an alert
    that automatically activates the emergency brakes to prevent accidents or collisions.
    The intelligent transport system could enable us to calculate the best route in
    real time by connecting different transport modes to save time and reduce carbon
    emissions. 4.3 IoT platforms The significant growth in IoT deployment has led
    to the emergence of IoT platforms which support: Easy integration of new devices
    and services. Communication between devices (objects and servers). The management
    of different devices and communication protocols. The transmission of data flows
    and the creation of new applications. Interoperability among components, objects,
    gateway, cloud data and software applications. Scalability of the IoT infrastructure.
    According to the level of services provided, IoT platforms can be divided into:
    Infrastructure-as-a-service backends: They provide hosting space and processing
    power for applications and services, e.g. IBM Bluemix [https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/fr].
    M2M connectivity platforms: They focus only on the connectivity of IoT objects
    through telecommunication networks and protocols, e.g. Comarch [http://www.comarch.com/telecommunications/solutions/m2m-platform/]
    and AirVantage [https://airvantage.net]. Hardware-specific software platforms:
    Numerous companies sell their proprietary technology which includes the hardware
    and the software backend, e.g Google Nest [https://nest.com/]. Enterprise software
    extensions: Some software and operating system companies such as Windows and Apple
    are increasingly allowing the integration of IoT devices such as smartphones,
    connected watches and home devices. According to Gazis et al. [41] and Dayarathna
    [42] the main features that an IoT platform must achieve are: Device integration.
    Networking. Device management. Security. Protocols for data collection. Analytics.
    Support for visualisations. On the basis of these features, Scully in [43] have
    proposed a stack for the IoT platform architecture as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Main components of an IoT application enablement
    platform [43] As we mentioned earlier, the number of IoT platforms is growing
    at a fast pace. According to [44] this market will reach $1 billion in 2019. In
    Fig. 11, we provide a comparison of different platforms where we describe their
    offered services, advantages and limitations. Fig. 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Comparison of the main IoT platforms 5 IoT challenges for achieving smart cities
    As explained previously, IoT relies on multiple technologies. Thus, weaknesses
    and security issues of IoT could be divided into two categories: (i) issues related
    to the technologies on which IoT is based on and (ii) new issues that emerge with
    IoT deployments. Fig. 12 illustrates the main IoT characteristics to achieve smart
    cities and the challenges that must be overcome to achieve such a goal. The main
    issues are those related to scalability, networking and transport, heterogeneity,
    privacy and authentication. In this section we discuss these issues. Fig. 13 summarises
    the most common IoT issues that arise from the three-layered IoT architecture
    as proposed by ITU-T [56]. Fig. 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint IoT characteristics
    to achieve smart city and their limitations Fig. 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Overview on main IoT issues 5.1 Networking and transport issues IoT will include
    a huge number of objects that should be reachable. Besides, each object will produce
    content that can be retrieved by any authorised user regardless of his/her location.
    To achieve this goal, effective addressing policies should be implemented. Currently,
    IP version 4 (IPv4) is the most predominant protocol. However, it is well known
    that the number of available IPv4 addresses is decreasing rapidly and IPv4 will
    soon become inadequate in providing new addresses. Therefore, we need to use other
    addressing policies. IPv6 addressing represents the best alternative to IPv4.
    Many works that aim to integrate IPv6 with IoT have been undertaken recently.
    For example, 6LowPAN [57] describes how to implement IPv6 protocol in a WSN context.
    However, since RFID tags use identifiers rather than MAC addresses (as standardised
    by EPC global [58]), it is necessary to propose new solutions in order to enable
    the addressing of RFID tags in IPv6-based networks. Recently, multiple studies
    that intend to integrate RFID tags into IPv6 networks have been investigated and
    multiple approaches aimed at integrating RFID identifiers and IPv6 addresses have
    been proposed [59-61]. However, results in this area are not completely mature
    and in particular there are no standards that currently describe how this integration
    should be done. It is also important to note that RFID mobility is not supported
    and still represents an open research issue. In traditional networks, IP addresses
    are resolved through the DNS. In IoT, communications occur between objects. Thus,
    the concept of ONS must be introduced and supported [5, 62, 63]. The difficulty
    of ONS arises especially in the case where the object is an RFID tag. In this
    case, the tag identifier (or IP address) is mapped onto an Internet uniform reference
    locator, which points to the relevant information of the object. In other cases,
    the ONS must have the capacity to associate the object''s description with a given
    RFID tag identifier (or IP address). However, the design and standardisation of
    such a system is still being investigated by researchers and designers of such
    systems [5]. The main goals of the transport layer reside in guaranteeing end-to-end
    reliability and to perform congestion control. In traditional networks, the transmission
    control protocol (TCP) supports these goals. However, it is known that TCP is
    not adapted to IoT environments [5, 64] because of many reasons: Connection setup:
    In TCP, each session begins with a connection phase procedure called the three-way
    handshake. Within the IoT ecosystem, a small amount of data will be exchanged.
    Therefore, the setup phase would last for a large part of the session time. This
    may lead to additional consumption of resources and energy. Congestion control:
    TCP ensures end-to-end congestion control. In the IoT context, it can generate
    performance problems as most of the communications are wireless. Indeed, such
    an environment is not well optimised for TCP [65]. Besides, the exchanged data
    amount within a single session is in general very small. Finally, TCP congestion
    control is not very adapted to the IoT environment because the whole TCP session
    includes just the transmission of the first segment and the reception of subsequent
    acknowledgements [5, 9]. Data buffering: TCP stores data in a memory buffer at
    both source and destination. (i) At the source for retransmission needs and (ii)
    at the destination for ordered delivery purposes. The management and allocation
    of such buffers may be too costly for objects. As a result, TCP cannot be used
    efficiently for the end-to-end transmission control in IoT and new transport layer
    protocol solutions are required [9]. The transport layer plays an essential role
    in IoT. Indeed, attacks toward this layer and its underlying RPL will seriously
    affect the network''s operation. Therefore, the design of secure and effective
    RPLs is an important research area in the IoT context. Owing to typical characteristics
    of IoT objects, existing solutions that have been previously applied to ad hoc
    and sensor networks do not completely address the needs of IoT. For example, denial
    of service (DoS) attacks could be more easily achieved on multiple IoT systems.
    The consequences of such attacks would be disastrous to the systems and their
    end users. The best way to detect and stop DoS and DDoS attacks is by using intrusion
    detection systems. However, the implementation of such systems in an IoT infrastructure
    appears to be a very challenging task because of the specific characteristics
    of the objects and their capabilities. Another important issue is traffic characterisation.
    Indeed, in IoT, highly heterogeneous objects lead to different scenarios. The
    characteristics of the related traffic flows generated by these scenarios have
    not really been studied extensively [5]. The traffic''s characterisation represents
    a very important step, because it helps network providers to plan the expansion
    of their infrastructures when it is needed, and to develop appropriate solutions
    for quality of service (QoS) support when needed. 5.2 Security issues The security
    of IoT is a major challenge for the sustainability and competitiveness of companies
    and administrations. The US Federal Trade Commission pointed out in a report [66]
    that the planned deployment of IoT technology will open up various security and
    privacy issues for IoT users and they need to be well addressed or resolved. For
    many of these critical IoT applications, the use of incorrect or maliciously corrupted
    data can have serious consequences. Conventional security solutions such as authentication,
    confidentiality and data integrity are critical to IoT objects, networks and applications.
    If IoT objects have enough memory and processing power, existing security protocols
    and algorithms may be applicable, but because of the resource constraints of IoT
    objects, these existing security solutions are too costly for the objects in IoT.
    Security issues remain major obstacles to the worldwide adoption and deployment
    of IoT. In other words, users will not fully adopt IoT if there is no guarantee
    that it will protect their privacy. Indeed, IoT is highly vulnerable to attacks
    for numerous reasons: (i) usually, objects spend most of their time unattended,
    which makes physical attacks on them relatively easy, (ii) most of the communications
    are wireless, which makes man-in-the-middle attack, one of the most common attacks
    on such a system. Consequently, exchanged messages may be subject to eavesdropping,
    malicious routing, message tampering and other security issues which can affect
    the security of the entire IoT and (iii) multiple types of objects such as RFID
    tags have limited resources in terms of energy and computation power, which prevent
    them from implementing advanced security solutions. Connected objects have their
    own vulnerabilities related to their specific features, in addition to existing
    vulnerabilities. These new vulnerabilities are caused by: Many different types
    of operating systems are used by the connected objects and are not always well
    known. The code of an operating system is usually in the order of tens of thousands
    or millions of lines code. Hence, the likelihood of having vulnerabilities is
    high. There are no known security standards. There are many proprietary protocols.
    The architectures are very heterogeneous, and the physical security is often compromised.
    The software integrity update of connected objects is not guaranteed. The security
    of the stored data is not guaranteed. The limited resources of a connected object
    prevent the use of classic cryptographic functions and security protocols. Data
    security issues can be summarised into data confidentiality, data authenticity,
    data integrity and data freshness. Cryptographic techniques are the best solutions
    to support these security needs [67]. 5.2.1 Data confidentiality, integrity and
    authentication Many IoT application scenarios require high data security including
    data confidentiality and data integrity. This requirement can be solved by data
    encryption. Data encryption algorithms are divided into two categories: (i) symmetric
    encryption algorithms and (ii) public-key encryption algorithms. The latter consume
    more resources which make them difficult to implement on objects with limited
    power and energy resources. In contrast, symmetric algorithms are suitable for
    such devices and are widely used in this context [67]. However, they suffer from
    several drawbacks: (i) the symmetric key exchange protocols of such cryptosystems
    are too complex which limits infrastructure scalability [7] and (ii) they suffer
    from the confidentiality problem of shared keys. Indeed, the higher the number
    of objects is, the bigger is the security risk. If one key is compromised, all
    system communications are compromised also. As a solution, the system can be divided
    into multiple groups and a different symmetric key is used within each group.
    However, the risk remains, since if one key is compromised, the communications
    with the group are also compromised. To address this problem, researchers have
    considered public-key encryption algorithms. In this solution, each object owns
    a pair of public and private keys. Each object keeps its private key, while the
    base station stores the public keys of all objects. Actually, the main proposals
    [68-70] of public-key encryption algorithms suitable for IoT [67] include Rabin''s
    Scheme [71], NtruEncrypt [72] and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) [73]. ECC
    offers good scalability, without complex key management protocol. However, the
    application of these algorithms to the IoT environment is still being investigated.
    In addition, they are not applicable to all types of objects especially RFID tags,
    where the problem of limited resources remains a challenging issue. Furthermore,
    public-key encryption solution suffers from trust issues. Indeed, a base station
    that owns public keys cannot prove that the objects are really what they pretend
    to be. 5.2.2 Key management Key management is another important issue in IoT.
    It plays a vital role in the implementation of various security solutions. Key
    management includes multiple steps that include key generation, distribution,
    storage, update and the destruction. An important component of the key management
    cycle is key distribution which includes secure transmission and distribution
    to legitimate users of (i) public keys and shared secrets in the case of asymmetric
    cryptography and (ii) secret keys in the case of symmetric cryptography. Numerous
    works [74-76] have proposed key management schemes adapted to technologies making
    up the IoT ecosystem, and more specifically for WSN in recent years. They use
    symmetric key management, public keys, abbreviated (a shortened certificate where
    some fields are removed) [77] or implicit certificates. However, these solutions
    were designed for WSNs primarily, and are not suited for all objects’ types. Consequently,
    the design of lightweight key management schemes adapted to the IoT environment
    and its application scenarios remains a key issue that needs to be solved in the
    future. 5.2.3 Trust management We need to develop and implement trust management
    mechanisms into IoT. Indeed, in numerous scenarios, the network relies on the
    cooperation of all nodes. The vulnerability of a single node can have serious
    consequences on the entire network. Indeed, if an attacker succeeds to compromise
    or add one or multiple objects in the network, the attacker can provide fake or
    erroneous information, which can subsequently affect the cooperation of nodes,
    data treatment and the result provided to the final user. Thus, the credibility
    of each single node is key to ensuring accurate and reliable network service delivery.
    Current trust management schemes such as those proposed in [74, 78] only provide
    verification of data consistency and validity, but cannot guarantee objects’ authentication.
    Furthermore, these previously proposed schemes are not completely adaptable to
    the IoT context. Consequently, more research is needed to develop lightweight
    trust management techniques and protocols that are specifically well suited for
    IoT scenarios in the future. 5.3 Heterogeneity issues Often, in IoT scenarios,
    data is collected from large number of objects which are widely distributed. However,
    the data collected in different ways using different protocols typically have
    different formats. Thus, it is not possible to effectively analyse, process and
    store such data without some standard format. This lack of standard also makes
    the integration of data obtained from heterogeneous sources difficult. Thus, it
    is necessary to develop: (i) standards regarding unified data encoding and (ii)
    information exchange protocols that will enable efficient and seamless data collection
    among heterogeneous IoT objects. 5.4 Denial OS The huge number of Internet devices
    in cities provides a real attack vector for malicious people [79, 80]. For example,
    in a big city, thousands or ten thousands of devices simultaneously communicate
    with both users and among themselves, the security implications are significant.
    Smart cities are the ideal target for hackers to create IoT bot networks. An IoT
    botnet consists of devices compromised and used to perform different tasks without
    the knowledge of their legitimate users. In 2016, Dyn firm (Dyn is one of the
    companies providing DNS service) suffered from a DoS attack caused by tens of
    thousands of connected objects (they were mostly connected cameras manufactured
    by the Chinese manufacturer XiongMai) to saturate its infrastructure [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/].
    The attack resulted in Dyn''s inability to provide the DNS service. Some of connected
    objects involved in the attack were caused by Mirai malware [81]. This tool exploits
    vulnerabilities present in some connected objects such as the use of a default
    password that has not changed by users. Hence, IoT networks are increasingly being
    used as an attack platform by malicious attackers. 5.5 Big data management As
    we mentioned previously, a smart city relies primarily on communication technologies.
    Thus, as the number of devices grows exponentially, a smart city becomes a source
    of huge amounts of data often referred to as big data [83, 84]. Indeed, according
    to the literatures [85, 83, 86], big data is characterised by specific characteristics
    which when related to smart cities, we note that: Volume: The huge number of devices
    continuously generate large amounts of data. Velocity: For many applications data
    is created and used in real or near real time. For example, traffic data must
    be used in real time to inform users and to guide them [87]. Another example is
    social media, where, sometimes messages, tweets, status updates and so on which
    are only a few seconds old may no longer be of interest to users. Variety: There
    are multiple types of devices, parts of different applications that are communicating
    through various protocols that generate a lot of heterogeneous data. An efficient
    use, mashing and correlation of these different types of data can enhance multiple
    applications and tasks such as: Facilitating decision making in order to enhance
    the QoS offered to end users. Visualisation and simulation of events and use cases.
    Modelling new use case scenarios. Accidents and disaster management. For example,
    if an accident occurs, it will be reported to the management infrastructure (centre)
    through traffic information. Then, the management centre sends the nearest police
    cars (having lower task priorities according to their transmitted information)
    and requests for ambulances. Besides, the centre sends accident warnings to car
    drivers in the accident area through car''s HMI and road advertisement boards,
    and recommends journey modifications to cars going through the accident area.
    It can also modify traffic flows and lights to facilitate ambulances’ tasks. The
    same scenario is possible in case of fire where the management centre will be
    informed through dedicated devices. However, none of the aforementioned benefits
    can be achieved without an efficient way to manage and leverage such large quantities
    of data generated and large-scale infrastructures. Currently, the most popular
    technology is cloud computing [85, 88, 82, 89]. Indeed, cloud computing solutions
    help in the storage, visualisation and processing of the data collected in order
    to make timely inferences and decisions. [82]. Fig. 14 depicts data management
    and analysis for smart city applications in a cloud-based environment. Fig. 14
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Cross-thematic data management and analysis for
    smart city applications in a cloud computing environment [82] There are numerous
    examples of applications that manage and analyse city data, and provide helpful
    information to users. Kitchin in [85] discusses several interesting use cases.
    One example is the collaboration between IBM and the Brazilian government to build
    a city-wide instrumented system that collects, processes and analyses data flows
    from 30 sources such as weather data, traffic state and public transport data,
    emergency services data, municipal and utility services data and so on. The correlation
    and mashing of information investigate particular aspects of city life to continuously
    propose new solutions. This data analytics centre, called ‘Centro De Operacoes
    Prefeitura Do Rio (http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/brasil/rj/2012-05-03/ig-visita-o-centro-de-operacoes-do-rio-de-janeiro.html)’
    is located in Rio De Janeiro [85] (as shown in Fig. 15). Fig. 15 Open in figure

    Another example is SmartSantanderRA [http://www.smartsantander.eu/index.php/blog/item/174-smartsantanderra-santander-augmented-reality-application]
    which represents a reality augmented application that includes information from
    about 2700 places such as beaches, parks and gardens, monuments, points of interest,
    tourism offices, shops, art galleries, museums, libraries, culture events agenda,
    shops, public buses, t -axis, bikes, parking places and so on in the city of Santander
    (Spain) [85]. SmartSantanderRA allows real-time access to traffic and beaches’
    cameras, weather reports and forecast, information about public buses and bike-rental
    service, thereby generating a unique ecosystem for citizens and visitors when
    walking around the city. Fig. 16 presents examples of the mobile application''s
    screenshots. Fig. 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Screenshots of SmartSantanderRA

    (http://www.apkmonk.com/app/es.unican.tlmat.smartsantanderra/] Cloud-based solutions
    can meet the majority of smart city applications requirements. However, considering
    the current infrastructure scalability evolution, these types of solutions alone
    will become inadequate in meeting future requirements of smart city applications
    (especially those real-time ones) because of the: the physical distance between
    data collection and its processing and the central nature of cloud computing.
    To address these aforementioned challenges, fog-based computing and edge computing
    solutions have been proposed [90-92]. Fog computing is a computing infrastructure
    that extends the cloud computing solution by keeping the advantages and power
    of the cloud closer to where data is created and acted on all by relying on a
    decentralised infrastructure. Data, processing, storage and applications are distributed
    in the most logical and efficient locations between the data source and the cloud.
    Similarly, edge computing brings data processing at the periphery of the network,
    as close as possible to the data source [93, 94]. 6 Conclusion With the expansion
    and the growth of cities, making them smart becomes vital. Indeed, numerous governments
    such as US, Chinese or UAE launched smart city''s projects e.g. Malmo, Fujisawa,
    Songdo and Masdar. IoT represents the best way to make a city smart. Indeed, IoT
    can be applied in multiple scenarios such as monitoring of building''s status
    with passive WSNs, environmental monitoring e.g. gas concentration, water level
    for lakes or soil humidity, waste management, smart parking, reducing CO2 footprint
    or autonomous driving. Achieving such goals needs a tremendous number of connected
    objects. Indeed, the number of connected objects is growing exponentially and
    it is estimated that 50 billion connected objects will be deployed in smart cities
    by 2020. However, this high number will open up numerous risks and privacy issues.
    In this work, we presented an overview of IoT in the context of smart cities,
    and discussed how it can enhance a city''s smartness. We also identified the weaknesses
    and risks associated to IoT deployment and adoption in the smart city environment.
    As part of our future work, we plan to survey the different solutions and recommendations
    to address several of the challenges of IoT and smart cities we have discussed
    in this paper and in particular the security challenges and issues. 7 Acknowledgments

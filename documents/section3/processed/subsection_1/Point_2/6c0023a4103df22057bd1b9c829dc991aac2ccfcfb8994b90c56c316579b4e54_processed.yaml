    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\
    \ conceived the study idea and \ndeveloped the analysis plan. R.M. and S.W. analyzed\
    \ the data \nand wrote the initial paper.  \nM.N.H. helped to prepare the figures\
    \ and tables and \nfinalizing the manuscript. R.M. completed the final editing\
    \ \nand figures of the manuscript. All authors read the manuscript. \nREFERENCES\

    aspects. This paper contributes to IoT by proposing an architecture for precision
    farming. The proposed architecture comprises a sensing layer, a network layer,
    a decision layer, and an application layer. The sensing layer consists of various
    sensors, the network layer manages traffic, the decision layer processes and manipulates
    data, and the application layer constitutes the firmware and the users. The proposed
    architecture aims to monitor the farm in real-time, optimize resource utilization,
    detect diseases early, identify plant species, optimize irrigation facilities,
    and make efficient use of pesticides. It prioritizes interoperability, robustness,
    and power consumption by incorporating energy harvesting approaches like solar
    and wind energy. The paper concludes that IoT is a core for developing new architectural
    concepts, and that IoT-based precision farming has the potential to make agriculture
    safer, more secure, and more trustworthy.

    the pressure on the agriculture sector. With the advent of technology, this decade
    is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed both the quality and quantity of
    the agriculture sector. Hybridization of species along with the real-time monitoring
    of the farms paved a way for resource optimization. Scientists, research institutions,
    academicians, and most nations across the globe are moving towards the practice
    and execution of collaborative projects to explore the horizon of this field for
    serving mankind. The tech industry is racing to provide more optimal solutions.
    Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless
    sensor networks can provide sufficient scope to predict, process, and analyze
    the situations and improve the activities in the real-time scenario. The concept
    of heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices by providing flexible, scalable,
    and durable methods, models are also opening new domains in this field. Therefore,
    this paper contributes towards the recent IoT technologies in the agriculture
    sector, along with the development of hardware and software systems. The public
    and private sector projects and startup''s started all over the globe to provide
    smart and sustainable solutions in precision agriculture are also discussed. The
    current scenario, applications, research potential, limitations, and future aspects
    are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of IoT a precision farming framework
    is also proposed in this article. A graphical abstract for Recent developments

    is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’ means ‘Cultivation’.
    It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one of the benchmark areas.
    This field is the withstander of the economies of various nations. According to
    the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), more than
    60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival and around 12%
    of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted by FAO,
    the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year 2025
    and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of this
    data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of 70%
    in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is also
    the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based fertilizers,
    biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations, the agriculture
    sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution in the
    growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE

    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.
    Show All SECTION IV. Related Work The advancement and role of the Internet of
    Things in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is
    being conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections. Various studies are performed and put forward by various
    academicians and authors concerning the evolution of agriculture relating to the
    incubation of the concepts of the Internet of Things. Kim et al. [64], reviewed
    different articles related to the induction of unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture.
    The authors highlighted the recent trends, controls, perspectives, and platforms
    of UAV for agriculture. The study focused on what are the different platforms
    used for UAV and how those platforms can be designed. The hardware components
    related to the design of UAVs were also discussed. Sensor types compatible with
    platforms such as fixed-wing, helicopter, quadcopter, etc. were also discussed.

    mapping, etc. were also presented. The authors concluded their study by providing
    the data on the latest technology trends and applications of UAVs in agriculture.
    Ayaz et al. [65], studied the latest trends and technologies in the field of agriculture.
    The potential sensors, IoT devices, communication techniques, used for soil, crop
    irrigation, insect, pest analysis were studied and discussed. Also, how this technology
    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An

    \ into a wide range of modern\nIoT applications. The growing number of networked\
    \ IoT devices generates a large amount of data.\nHowever, processing and memorizing\
    \ this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed\ncritical challenges,\
    \ especially when using artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit\n\
    valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged\
    \ as a way to bring\ncloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to\
    \ address computation-intensive ofﬂoading\nand latency issues. This paper provides\
    \ a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works\nrelated to UAV technology\
    \ applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details\n\
    the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications\
    \ and the role of\nboth deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting\
    \ various limitations related to latency,\ntask ofﬂoading, energy demand, and\
    \ security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains\nan insight\
    \ into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges\
    \ to be\ntackled when using AI.\nKeywords: UAVs; IoT; cloud computing; edge computing;\
    \ MEC; AI; review\n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is constantly\
    \ expanding to cover many ﬁelds\nand applications. IoT devices present many beneﬁts\
    \ for improving services in a broad\nrange of contexts. The number of connected\
    \ devices is forecasted to reach impressive\nheights in the coming years. According\
    \ to CISCO, more than 70 billion devices will be\nconnected by the end of 2025\
    \ [1,2]. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically\nknown as drones,\
    \ have attracted considerable attention from academia and industrial\ncommunities\
    \ due to their excellent capabilities and attractive features. They promise to\n\
    bring an ideal contribution to the ﬁeld of IoT, based on their unique characteristics.\
    \ They\noffer elastic and ﬂexible mobile features, as required in many omnipresent\
    \ IoT applications,\nmaking their integration into wireless network communication\
    \ easy and feasible.\nMoreover, integrating embedded intelligent devices such\
    \ as cameras and sensors on\nUAVs offer many advantages when monitoring hostile\
    \ and unreachable environments.\nIn addition, they can potentially provide many\
    \ services in the context of modern IoT\ninterconnection, such as smart cities,\
    \ smart farming, smart factories, smart grids, and\nintelligent transportation.\
    \ The development of communication protocols and networks\nhas also improved the\
    \ tracking and maneuverability of drones to cover many application\nrequirements,\
    \ as well as their contribution as a critical component of the communication\n\
    network [3]. UAVs can also guarantee reliable connectivity in hostile areas with\
    \ limited\nDrones 2021, 5, 148. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones5040148\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n2 of 30\nor unavailable communication infrastructure. Typically,\
    \ UAVs can be deployed as aided\ncommunication networks by integrating them into\
    \ the peripheral network as ﬂying base\nstations (BSs) [4,5], relay nodes [6],\
    \ or terminal nodes [7]. Therefore, they act primarily as a\nmeans of enabling\
    \ ﬂexible communication services in remote areas when interconnections\nwith existing\
    \ networks are lost. To this end, UAVs can be used in edge-computing (EC),\nfog-computing\
    \ (FC), and as crucial equipment in cellular networks [8].\nIoT networks enable\
    \ comprehensive connectivity for many mobile users by enabling\nvarious emerged\
    \ application services (e.g., automatic surveillance, unmanned control\nvehicles\
    \ and object recognition). Centralized servers, such as cloud computing (CC)\n\
    facilities and data centers, generally process and analyze the generated data\
    \ by carrying out\ncomputational intelligence based on artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI). These centralized systems\nare quick to deploy, inexpensive to maintain,\
    \ and practical when data need to be centrally\ncontrolled. However, they are\
    \ mostly constrained by their high failure rate, security risks\nand access delay.\
    \ Data processing at the central level causes considerable time delays that\n\
    affect the overall system quality of service (QoS), especially regarding the response-time\n\
    requirement for latency-sensitive applications. Decentralized and distributed\
    \ systems have\nemerged to solve the issue of centralized system constraints.\
    \ The decentralized system relies\non servers that are supposed to store a copy\
    \ of the resources. Users in distributed systems\nhave equal access to data, yet\
    \ user rights can be enabled as necessary, and data ownership\ncan be shared efﬁciently.\
    \ Hardware and software resources are also allocated between\nusers, increasing\
    \ truthfulness, reducing component failure, and enhancing reliability.\nEC has\
    \ recently been introduced to provide intermediate devices between the data\n\
    generator and CC services. This reduces latency and provides efﬁcient bandwidth\
    \ uti-\nlization. However, due to their limited computing power and battery life,\
    \ mobile devices\nstruggle to provide these services. To this end, mobile edge\
    \ computing (MEC) solutions\nhave been employed to ameliorate the intensive computation\
    \ and ofﬂoading bottlenecks\nbetween end-nodes and centralized data servers [9].\
    \ They allow mobile devices to ofﬂoad\ntheir computation duties onto servers at\
    \ the edge of the IoT network, such as cellular BSs\nor access points. In contrast\
    \ to traditional CC, MEC servers can be close to end-users. As a\nresult, MEC\
    \ servers can deliver low latency and secure services, while saving energy for\n\
    mobile users.\nRecently, UAVs have been integrated as air–ground equipment to\
    \ fulﬁll the processing\nand storage needs at IoT network edges. As a promising\
    \ solution, they could provide ultra-\nlow latency support for latency-sensitive\
    \ applications, facilitate the distribution of big data\nprocessing and analysis,\
    \ improve the scalability and management of massive mobile con-\nnectivity, as\
    \ well as content caching and mobile delivery [10]. The advantage presented by\n\
    their ﬂexible mobility has facilitated the integration of UAVs with MEC services\
    \ to provide\nUAV-enabled MEC networks. UAV-enabled MEC is typically deployed\
    \ in unpredictable\nenvironments such as in wild, desert, and complex landscapes.\
    \ Furthermore, the computa-\ntion performance may be adapted based on the distance\
    \ that UAVs can smoothly control.\nThis combination of UAV technology with MEC\
    \ makes the system more advantageous\nand ﬂexible than traditional MEC systems,\
    \ which are constrained by high deployment\ncosts due to their ﬁxed architecture.\
    \ In addition, the integration of UAV-enabled MEC\nwith the most recent security\
    \ approaches, such as the blockchain structure, increases the\nsecurity level\
    \ [11]. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that gives a secure, immutable,\n\
    transparent, and trustworthy environment for the UAVs to store their data as a\
    \ transaction\nin a chain of blocks [12]. This is a viable solution to mitigate\
    \ the security and privacy issues\nrelated to UAV networks. Therefore, integrating\
    \ blockchain into UAVs ensures the MEC\nsystem’s trustworthiness with the additional,\
    \ advantageous features of automating data\ntransaction, decision-making, storage,\
    \ and veriﬁcation [13]. Therefore, UAVs can play a\ncrucial role in enabling MEC\
    \ capability in IoT applications. However, many critical issues\nhave yet to be\
    \ addressed to improve the performance of UAV-enabled MEC. Most of the\nimpairments\
    \ are related to drones as they are autonomous and battery-powered, with\nlimited\
    \ resources. Furthermore, given the broadcast nature of communications between\n\
    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n3 of 30\nground-based users and UAVs, many performance aspects\
    \ should be addressed, including\nsecurity, task ofﬂoading, energy consumption,\
    \ resource allocation, computing capacity, and\nuser latency performance under\
    \ various channel circumstances.\nSince this topic is revolutionary in the IoT\
    \ research ﬁeld, reviewing the current sci-\nentiﬁc achievements and technological\
    \ limitations of UAV-enabled MEC networks is of\nparamount importance. Furthermore,\
    \ the limits of existing surveys on UAV-enabled MEC\nin IoT applications have\
    \ motivated us to put forward a detailed review. This paper explores\nthe use\
    \ of UAVs in emerging IoT applications and the utility of both deep learning (DL)\n\
    and machine learning (ML) in UAV-enabled MEC systems. For instance, the authors\
    \ of [14]\nhave elaborated a review about the energy efﬁciency constraints related\
    \ to UAV-enabled\nMEC systems for IoT devices. Additionally, the authors of [15,16]\
    \ have presented a survey\nabout communication and networking technologies for\
    \ UAVs. The research work presented\nin [17] has addressed both fundamental and\
    \ recent advances of computation ofﬂoading\nin UAV-enabled MEC. However, only\
    \ a few of the challenges are mentioned in the above\nworks, including energy,\
    \ communication facilities, and limited resource allocation issues.\nIn this paper,\
    \ the most critical issues and challenges of UAV-enabled MEC based on AI are\n\
    accurately outlined and discussed.\nIndeed, there are several recent reviews about\
    \ the UAV-enabled MEC paradigm. How-\never, most of the previous reviews have\
    \ focused on UAV energy efﬁciency, communication\ntechnologies connecting various\
    \ UAVs, and computation ofﬂoading in UAV-enabled MEC.\nOur review considers a\
    \ more practical and recent scenario wherein massively generated\ndata need to\
    \ be processed and analyzed using AI algorithms for decision-making at the\nedge\
    \ of networks. This has not been considered in the previous works. Adopting AI\n\
    methods would affect all the requirements that have already been investigated,\
    \ such as\nenergy efﬁciency, communication technologies, processing capacity,\
    \ privacy and security,\nand the autonomy of UAV-enabled MEC. Almost all domains\
    \ are currently relying on AI\nto outperform the traditional systems and provide\
    \ decision-making systems. For instance,\nIndustry 4.0 has newly emerged as a\
    \ revolutionary paradigm in which intelligent and\nautonomous drones based on\
    \ AI would be the key element. However, the integration of\nautonomous UAVs based\

    \ an increase in customer demand for airborne intelligence\nmissions, which has\
    \ led to the design and development of various types of UAVs in various\nshapes\
    \ and ﬂight modes. This section highlights the different styles and characteristics\
    \ of\nUAVs and their application scenarios.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n4 of 30\n2.1.\
    \ UAVs Classiﬁcation\nDeploying a UAV network (known as swarms in IoT contexts)\
    \ is becoming a practical\nand necessary requirement for many applications. Various\
    \ UAVs are currently available\non the market, with distinctive features such\
    \ as supportable altitude, speed, and battery\nautonomy, for multiple applications.\
    \ Generally, the selection of any UAV model should\nfulﬁll many of the criteria\
    \ of the targeted application, such as QoS, energy capacity, envi-\nronmental\
    \ restrictions, and federal rules [18]. There are three types of UAVs: low-altitude\n\
    platforms (LAPs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites. Since this work\
    \ focuses\non UAV-enabled MEC, UAVs are described based on many aspects.\nFigure\
    \ 1 categorizes UAVs into the LAPs category based on their type, size, range,\n\
    and type of rotors. Figure 2 shows the shape and form of three kinds of commercialized\n\
    UAVs: a rotary-wing drone (Figure 2a), a ﬁxed-wing drone (Figure 2b), and a ﬁxed\
    \ wing\nhybrid VTOL UAV (Figure 2c).\nautonomy, for multiple applications. Generally,\

    Drones 2021, 5, 148\n6 of 30\n2.2. UAV-Enabled Services\nUAV technology’s appealing\
    \ ﬂexibility and mobility characteristics have drawn atten-\ntion in terms of\
    \ integration with other networks as a way to address various challenging\napplications.\
    \ UAVs can be a part of IoT networks, referred to as the Internet of Flying\n\
    Things (IoFT) [25]. The IoFT can improve the availability of IoT services in areas\
    \ with poor\ncommunication coverage and limited infrastructures. For instance,\
    \ UAVs can provide FC\nand EC services and cellular communications in rural or\
    \ developing regions and submarine\nenvironments. As a result, reaching hostile\
    \ and congested environments has become easier\nand faster, thus improving emergent\
    \ intervention wherever and whenever it is required.\nAs support to communication\
    \ networks, UAVs can be dispatched as peripheral nodes with\nvarious operating\
    \ units, such as ﬂying BSs, relay nodes, or end-node stations [7]. UAVs act\n\
    as relay/terminal nodes related to disconnected nodes, stabilizing communication\
    \ links\nin an ad hoc manner. A set of deployed UAVs can thereby form a ﬂying\
    \ ad hoc network\n(FANET), which is a subclass of the mobile ad hoc network (MANET)\
    \ [26].\nIn IoT networks, UAVs can potentially adopt many recent cellular and\
    \ non-cellular\nwireless communication networks to control the UAV on the one\
    \ hand, and to enhance\nthe coverage and latency services on the other. The most\
    \ prominent communication pro-\ntocols that can be used with UAVs are IEEE 802.11\
    \ (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMax), IEEE\n802.15.4 (LRWPAN), cellular networks (3G/4G),\
    \ IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), LoRaWAN\n(LoRa), SigFox and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ [27–31]. Typically, the choice of communica-\ntion protocol depends on the desired\
    \ achievable throughput, power consumption, range,\nimplementation cost, reliability,\
    \ delay, and security. Grouped according to application\nrequirements, the characteristics\
    \ of the most-used communication protocols are presented\nin [32]. As described\
    \ in Table 2, there are various available communication protocols that\ncan be\
    \ used in UAV-enabled MEC. Each protocol is given a list of advantages and disad-\n\
    vantages regarding data rate, coverage, deployment cost, energy consumption, latency,\n\
    spectrum availability, and the number of supported users. Thus, the use of communication\n\
    technology depends literally on the application requirements.\nAlong with high\
    \ mobility and scalability, UAVs can offer many potential opportu-\nnities in\
    \ terms of enabling services such as pervasive connectivity, aerial intelligence,\n\
    self-maintenance capabilities for communications, and sensor deployment. Therefore,\n\
    UAVs act as airborne BSs [33], data collectors, relay nodes [34], jammers [35],\
    \ monitors [36],\nedge- and cloud computing servers [37], and power suppliers\
    \ [38] to support IoT applica-\ntions. These will extend network coverage and\
    \ provide diversiﬁed and ﬂexible intelligence\nfacilities for new potentialities\
    \ in modern IoT applications. In summary, as illustrated\nin Figure 3, UAVs can\
    \ facilitate a wide range of solutions in IoT applications. They can\nprovide\
    \ intelligent communications by establishing wireless networks in inaccessible\
    \ and\nhazardous environments; they also enable parallel intelligent areal services,\
    \ such as CC,\nEC, and LC.\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n7 of 30\nTable 2. Characteristics\

    Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural fields to detect specific\
    \ diseases \nthat threaten the quality of plants at an early stage. The implemented\
    \ system can predict \nfarm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing\
    \ and AI classification based on \nIoT architecture, using real-time data acquisition\
    \ [39]. In ref. [40], the authors have \nproposed an architecture combining UAVs\
    \ and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with \nIoT approaches to provide precise\
    \ ecological agriculture. Another architecture for crop \nmapping monitoring and\
    \ disease assessment-based satellite imagery using the DL \napproach has been\
    \ proposed to analyze the images acquired through UAV airborne \nmultispectral\
    \ sensors [41]. Additionally, UAVs can efficiently enhance the productivity of\
    \ \nfarming activities, as referenced in [42–44]. In addition, UAVs play an exciting\
    \ role in crop \nmonitoring by facilitating many tasks previously restricted to\
    \ the laborer and farmer [45–\n47]. \n• \nIndustry 4.0: \nUAV\nIntelligent communications\n\

    \ can predict\nfarm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing and AI\

    in [42–44]. In addition, UAVs play an exciting role in crop monitoring by facilitating\
    \ many\ntasks previously restricted to the laborer and farmer [45–47].\n•\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0:\nThe increasing demand for fast and low-cost productivity has encouraged\
    \ the indus-\ntrial and research communities to incorporate robotics into the\
    \ industrial process. UAVs\nhave recently attracted the attention of industrial\
    \ solution providers in response to the\nincreased need for productivity; for\
    \ instance, the authors proposed an industrial IoT-based\nsystem that collects\
    \ data by a UAV camera and sends it to a cloud server for process-\ning [48].\
    \ The design aims to monitor the industrial zone to prevent undesirable incidents\n\
    in the production process, relying on the robust intelligence of computer vision\
    \ (CV) ap-\nproaches [49,50]. The mining industry has also increased the level\
    \ of interest in drones for\n3D mapping, mine safety, and mine management [51].\n\
    •\nEnvironment:\nUAVs are being adopted as a means to monitor and survey various\
    \ environmental\nareas. They can be used for the monitoring and data aggregation\
    \ of archeological sites. For\nexample, the authors of [52] have reported that\
    \ UAVs can present accurate and precise\nimages of the studied archeological space,\
    \ compared to terrestrial measurements. UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n10 of 30\ntechnologies\
    \ can also be deployed in ecological monitoring systems to track wildlife in\n\
    heterogeneous territories and topographically challenging areas as a supporting\
    \ platform\nfor traditional techniques [53]. Besides, this technology may facilitate\
    \ geological researchers\nwhen collecting remote data about many species and animals\
    \ [54]. Moreover, the authors\nof [55] proposed an intelligent model based on\
    \ UAV, dedicated to monitoring several types\nof plants using the latest computer\
    \ vision algorithms and cloud computing technologies.\nUAVs are also used to track\
    \ wild animals over large areas [56].\n•\nHealth and emergency:\nDrones can offer\
    \ several beneﬁts for public health emergencies, for instance, tackling\nepidemics\
    \ and contagious diseases such as COVID-19. For instance, during the COVID-19\n\
    pandemic, some governments and countries adopted drones to survey the rapid spread\n\
    of the virus, diagnose patients, and then predict the mortality risk factor by\
    \ applying AI\napproaches to the collected data. The drones have been used to\
    \ observe crowds, broadcast\ncritical public announcements and information, spray\
    \ disinfectants, and carry out extensive\ntemperature measurements in several\
    \ residential areas [57]. Additionally, the lifeguard\ncommunity uses UAVs for\
    \ search and rescue missions requiring rapid intervention. Their\nversatility\
    \ also allows obtaining a quick overview of the rescue situation instead of using\n\
    human-crewed airplanes that may take extra time to deploy [58]. Relying on UAV-enabled\n\
    MEC, AI, and CV schemes could lead to new applications that simulate visual reality,\n\
    thus enabling faster and real-time decisions in emergency interventions. For instance,\n\
    UAVs typically detect obstacles by ﬂying over them, gathering data, extracting\
    \ the most\nprominent features, and making decisions based on machine vision and\
    \ pattern recognition\ntechnologies. In this manner, people with visual impairments\
    \ can maneuver comfortably.\nThis technology is expected to be a key solution\
    \ in the healthcare revolution [58].\n•\nSmart cities and smart homes:\nThe urban\
    \ environment is expected to acquire a massive number of dynamically\nconnected\
    \ devices due to diverse activities wherein UAVs as mobile vehicles will have\
    \ many\npivotal roles, including real-time trafﬁc control [59], transportation\
    \ [60], infrastructure\ncontrol and management [61], and buildings observation\
    \ [62]. Accordingly, UAVs are\nexpected to provide communication services to heterogeneous\
    \ smart devices in urban\nareas, to improve the smart city from application perspectives\
    \ [63]. For example, the\nauthors of [64] have proposed an architecture for 5G\

    \ to harnessing the full potential of UAV communi-\ncations for cellular and wireless\
    \ communications in the networks industry. The research\ncommunity explored the\
    \ opportunity of UAV-mounted utilization via ﬂying relays and BSs\nthat can dynamically\
    \ reposition themselves to boost network coverage, increase spectral\nefﬁciency,\
    \ and improve user QoS. The UAVs enable low-altitude supports beyond line-of-\n\
    sight (LOS) control and reliable communications [72]. Furthermore, UAVs can bring\
    \ many\nfacilities to cellular IoT-based networks by providing processing facilities\
    \ near the ground\nfor users.\n2.4. UAV-Enabled and -Assisted MEC Architecture\n\
    Centralized networks are easy to maintain because they have just one point of\
    \ failure.\nHowever, due to the instability of the system categories, this design\
    \ is insufﬁcient to\nrespond to ubiquitous applications. A single issue affecting\
    \ the core server might destroy\nthe entire system. Unlike centralized networks,\
    \ distributed networks are deemed more\nstable due to their decentralized architecture,\
    \ since the entirety of the information system\nis dispersed among a vast number\
    \ of nodes that maintain similar conditions. This feature\nimproves distributed\
    \ system security by making it challenging to target many users.\nFurthermore,\
    \ blockchain is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed ledger that provides a\nsecure,\
    \ immutable, transparent, and trustless environment due to its distributed architec-\n\
    ture. Integrating this approach with UAVs allows them to record their data in\
    \ the chain of\nblocks as a transaction, ensuring their trustworthiness [74].\
    \ The essential foundations of\nblockchain technology are intelligent contracts\
    \ and consensus mechanisms. This method\neliminates the requirement for a trusted\
    \ third-party system to protect data privacy since\nconsensus techniques maintain\
    \ data integrity. The use of cryptographic methods guaran-\ntees that data on\
    \ blockchains are secure. These exciting blockchain characteristics increase\n\
    the applicability of UAVs in a variety of civil and mission-critical applications\
    \ that use\nUAV-enabled MEC architecture. Moreover, distributed systems outperform\
    \ centralized\nsystems in terms of network speed, since the information is not\
    \ stored in a central lo-\ncation, and the number of users attempting to access\
    \ a server is more signiﬁcant than\nthe server can support, causing long waiting\
    \ times and slowing down the system for\ndecentralized architecture.\nMoving all\
    \ computing activities to the cloud has proven an effective mechanism to\nprocess\
    \ data since the cloud offers greater processing capacity than network edge devices.\n\
    However, data-processing speeds have risen rapidly due to the size of communicated\
    \ data\nand the networks’ bandwidth. Therefore, CC suffers from bottlenecks due\
    \ to the massive\nvolume of data generated in real time. Cameras in UAVs capture\
    \ a tremendous amount\nof video data, which the system should process in real-time\
    \ to enable good decision-\nmaking. Sending data from UAVs to the cloud server\
    \ would mostly result in longer\ndelays. Deploying a large number of IoT devices,\
    \ such as UAVs, would restrict bandwidth,\nreliability and security. Therefore,\
    \ processing data at the network edge would yield shorter\nresponse times, more\
    \ efﬁcient processing, and less pressure on the network.\nMEC is widely acknowledged\
    \ as a vital technology to implement many methods for\nnext-generation IoT applications.\
    \ Due to their versatility and ease of deployment, UAVs\ncan play various roles\
    \ in delivering edge computing services. UAV-enabled MEC designs\ncan be classiﬁed\
    \ and dedicated to a speciﬁc application scenario. A UAV can be considered\nas\
    \ a mobile EC server, an IoT node, or a relay. Firstly, UAVs can participate in\
    \ the system as\nmobile devices when they ofﬂoad their computing to an MEC server.\
    \ Secondly, the UAV\ncan act as the MEC responsible for monitoring a group of\
    \ mobile end nodes. Thirdly, the\nUAV can serve as a relay or gateway between\
    \ mobile end nodes and an MEC server.\nThe UAV may be regarded as a speciﬁc user\
    \ that could ofﬂoad those computing tasks\nexceeding its memory and processing\
    \ capacity to a MEC server, as shown in Figure 4a.\nUAVs typically have limited\
    \ battery capacity and insufﬁcient memory and computing\npower to execute complex\
    \ computational tasks. As a result, ofﬂoading their processing to\nDrones 2021,\

    \ once the ground-based users ofﬂoad their\ncomputation responsibilities to the\
    \ latter. In the third scenario depicted in Figure 4c, the\nUAV serves as a central\
    \ relay, assisting mobile users to ofﬂoad their computing tasks to a\nspeciﬁc\

    \ their computing tasks to a \nspecific MEC server. \n \nFigure 4. UAV-enabled\
    \ architecture. \nDespite the substantial benefits afforded by the architecture\
    \ of UAV-enabled MECs \nto provide low latency and high-reliability services to\
    \ IoT devices, numerous challenges \nremain. These challenges are found in intra-UAV\
    \ communication, UAV security, air data \nsecurity, data storage, and management.\
    \ Moreover, the coordination between UAVs and \nground-based users requires considerable\
    \ improvement due to the system’s mobility \ncharacteristics, which complicate\
    \ communication. Another significant limitation of UAVs \nis found in their low\
    \ onboard battery capacity. In addition to the energy spent in hovering, \naccelerating/decelerating,\
    \ and climbing up/down, additional energy is consumed due to \nonboard computations.\
    \ Therefore, designing efficient methods for resource and energy \nmanagement\
    \ is urgently required. \nFurthermore, one of the major design problems regarding\
    \ computation task \nrequirements is the joint trajectory design in UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC networks. In this regard, \nresearch efforts should emphasize how to forecast\
    \ mobile user movement and follow the \ntrajectory so that computing activities\
    \ can be offloaded quickly, and computation results \nmay be sent back to users\
    \ on time. The trajectory design is especially challenging when \ndealing with\
    \ multi-UAV-enabled MEC services. Another challenge is found in the \nintegration\
    \ of the blockchain into UAVs. As standalone technologies, UAVs face many \nchallenges\

    \ MEC was intensively investigated.\nMEC can bring information technology (IT)\

    \ MEC and Assisted MEC Based on AI\nMEC is an effective method for overcoming\
    \ time-constrained computing challenges\nin resource-constrained mobile IoT devices.\
    \ The objective is to bring CC services closer\nto customers to minimize latency\
    \ and backhaul network congestion. UAVs with storage\nunits, processing, and communication\
    \ capabilities can function as ﬂying MEC servers at\nthe IoT system’s edge. In\
    \ this context, resource-constrained IoT devices may ofﬂoad their\nDrones 2021,\
    \ 5, 148\n19 of 30\ncomputing activities, either partially or totally, to MEC-server-mounted\
    \ UAVs through\ndirect line-of-sight connectivity. Nevertheless, the system faces\
    \ many challenges related to\ntask prediction, UAV deployment, users’ association,\
    \ signal processing, and joint resource\nallocation. Considering the EC architecture,\
    \ UAVs with ﬂexibility and mobility are likely\nto deliver decentralized solution\
    \ perspectives signiﬁcantly. The ﬂying edge architecture is\nintended to improve\
    \ the CC capabilities of latency-sensitive and real-time IoT applications.\nThis\
    \ enables computing ofﬂoading at the edge of IoT devices rather than centralized\
    \ data\ncenters, reducing communication latency and facilitating real-time decision-making\
    \ and\ncontrol. Since the IoT system operates with many end-devices, a large quantity\
    \ of data\nis ofﬂoaded to the edge devices; this requires developing mechanisms\
    \ that manage and\nexploit the data for various purposes, such as auto-maintenance,\
    \ self-monitoring, and\nprediction. There is a considerable difference between\
    \ EC devices and centralized cloud\nservers regarding their processing capacities\
    \ and memory, limiting multiple AI technolo-\ngies for data processing at the\
    \ edge. Therefore, numerous criteria should be considered\nwhen incorporating\
    \ any AI technique to proﬁt from their robustness, due to memory ca-\npacity and\
    \ energy consumption constraints [111]. EC delivers resources in a decentralized\n\
    manner, allowing faster addressing of user demands than a regular CC, even with\
    \ limited\ncomputational capability. Various challenges arise, such as task scheduling,\
    \ resource allo-\ncation, and ofﬂoading, substantially inﬂuencing the overall\
    \ performance. Nevertheless,\nmost of the proposed solutions are characterized\
    \ by non-convexity and complexity, as\nthey enable continuous learning ability\
    \ for the dynamic environment and make a real-time\ninference with low computational\
    \ complexity. Applying AI to networking challenges has\ngained popularity over\
    \ the past few decades. For instance, ML has been widely used\nin the networking\
    \ domain due to its ability to interact with complex environments and\nmake decisions.\
    \ It may also provide eminent solutions to improve network performance in\nmany\
    \ subdomains, such as resource allocation, network trafﬁc prediction and classiﬁcation,\n\
    congestion control, and routing [32].\nIn most UAV-enabled MEC architectures,\
    \ a controller called the follow-me cloud\n(FMC) collects information about overall\
    \ system states (i.e., users, UAVs, and MEC servers).\nThis control unit is in\
    \ charge of managing ofﬂoading activities using AI technologies.\nFigure 5 displays\
    \ an example of a cloudlet mounted on a UAV for a UAV-assisted MEC\nsystem. The\
    \ UAV receives ofﬂoaded tasks from an IoT device and sends the results back\n\
    upon fulﬁllment of the task’s execution. Furthermore, the UAV could transport\
    \ the received\ndata to the nearest ground servers in case of complex processing\

    \ have proved that the deep supervised learning (DSL) method min-\nimizes the\
    \ computation and ofﬂoading overheads and cost of mobile users in the MEC\nsystem.\
    \ This technique allows terrestrial users to obtain an optimal ofﬂoading policy,\
    \ with\nenergy-saving and processing speed enhancement.\nThe authors of [91] have\
    \ investigated the challenges associated with applying AI\ntechniques to UAV-NOMA-MEC\
    \ networks. They proposed an architecture that relies\non AI-based approaches,\
    \ particularly on federated learning and reinforcement learning.\nThe proposed\
    \ framework was dedicated to enabling terrestrial mobile users to ofﬂoad\ntheir\
    \ computational tasks simultaneously, intelligently, and ﬂexibly, thus enhancing\
    \ their\nconnectivity and reducing their transmission latency and energy consumption.\n\
    The authors of [135] used RL and transfer learning algorithms to reduce the latency\
    \ and\nenergy consumption in UAV-enabled MEC networks. They proved that transfer\
    \ learning,\nwhen combined with RL, could signiﬁcantly enhance the system training\
    \ performance\nwhen the users operated dynamically.\nAn optimization problem based\
    \ on MDP was formulated by the authors of [35] to\naddress UAV trajectory optimization\
    \ in UAV-mounted MEC networks. The approach\naimed to enhance the overall system\
    \ QoS, maximize the long-term system reward, and\nmeet the QoS constraint, including\
    \ the computation tasks of mobile users. In [136], the\nauthors have used the\
    \ semi-Markov process and DRL-based algorithms to address the\nUAV-enabled MEC\
    \ networks’ ofﬂoading decisions and resource management policies.\nThe authors\
    \ of [137] have developed a platform known as a ﬂying UAV MEC, in which\nUAVs\
    \ are outﬁtted with computing resources and provide task-ofﬂoading services to\
    \ users.\nThe suggested architecture’s primary purpose was to maximize UAV aerial\
    \ trajectory,\nuser association, and resource allocation. The trajectory control\
    \ method has been used\nto address the optimization issue, assisted by an RL-based\
    \ technique. The results of this\napproach outperformed the results of the equivalent\
    \ benchmark methods. Moreover, the\nauthors of [138] formulated an ML-based novel\
    \ framework to optimize UAV trajectories\nby estimating the user’s mobility data\
    \ to ﬁnd optimal initial UAV placement locations.\nThe joint problem, consisting\
    \ of UAVs trajectories and power control to improve the sum\nrate and maintain\
    \ the data rate requirements of mobile users, was also addressed in the\nemployment\
    \ of a multi-agent Q-learning-based technique. A smart ofﬂoading based on the\n\
    deep Q-learning approach was proposed by the authors of [139] to optimize performance\n\
    in terms of the delay perceived by ground devices connected to the FANET, to enable\
    \ MEC\nin the 5G ﬁeld.\n5. Discussion and Open Issues\nComputational intelligence,\
    \ when combined with UAVs, has improved the underlying\ntechnologies and implementations\
    \ of IoT applications. Nevertheless, researchers should\naddress the remaining\
    \ challenges. Therefore, some signiﬁcant issues need more attention\nin order\
    \ to beneﬁt from UAVs for the realization of ﬂying ECs. These issues may be\n\
    related to scientiﬁc, technological, and societal problems, including challenges\
    \ regarding\nthe technical aspects of the technology, security and privacy concerns,\
    \ and standardization.\nThe challenges concern both the UAVs themselves and EC\
    \ devices. Therefore, great effort\nis needed to address the following challenges.\n\
    Energy consumption: In any UAV-enabled IoT system, most sensors, edge devices,\
    \ and\ndrones are battery-powered and can only remain powered for a limited period.\
    \ Therefore,\nefﬁcient energy consumption protocols and mechanisms are essential\
    \ for UAVs and IoT de-\nvices to ensure a long network lifetime. Improvement efforts\
    \ should address the hardware\nand software architecture of the IoT components\
    \ by integrating energy-harvesting solutions\nor efﬁcient routing protocols. For\
    \ example, AI schemes can be adopted to predict a UAV’s\nresidual energy and energy\
    \ dissipation through the precise adjustment of transmission\nand control parameters\
    \ concerning channel changes. The processing energy dissipation,\ncommunication\
    \ energy, storage energy, and environmental reliability should be considered\n\
    to mitigate the energy of UAVs [115,140]. Moreover, the issues listed below should\
    \ also\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n22 of 30\nbe considered to mitigate energy consumption,\
    \ to extend the on-air ﬂying time of the\nUAVs employed.\nInterference: The communication\
    \ links between UAVs and IoT devices may become\ndisconnected due to interference,\
    \ which reduces latency performance and may also affect\nthe overall network,\
    \ especially when the UAVs act as a mobile BS. Therefore, the problem\nof interference\
    \ should be addressed, especially in urban and industrial environments,\nwhere\
    \ the number of interconnected devices on the same frequency band is very dense.\
    \ An\nAI-based solution can be applied in UAV-enabled MEC to predict the signal-to-interference\n\
    ratio, based on the collected channel state information (CSI). It is then possible\
    \ to decide on\nthe most appropriate scheme to combat the impact of interference\
    \ or to adjust transmission\nparameters in order to reduce power consumption.\n\
    Interoperability: In any IoT environment, many devices are expected to handle\
    \ the\nrequired tasks without any effort from the end-users. These devices try\
    \ to connect and\ninteract with each other using different protocols and communication\
    \ paradigms. With\nthis diversity, it is sometimes challenging to orchestrate\
    \ the system smoothly. Therefore,\nfurther investigations are necessary to unify\
    \ the controller and communication protocols to\nensure interoperability among\
    \ them.\nMobility and path planning: UAVs require auto-maneuvering without distant\
    \ hu-\nman pilot intervention in random dynamic IoT applications. Therefore, many\
    \ intelligent\nmethods should be considered to enable autonomous UAV ﬂights that\
    \ include collision\navoidance. AI algorithms are the most viable solutions that\
    \ can be used to detect obsta-\ncles and avoid collisions [141]. For instance,\
    \ DL techniques can enable learning from the\ngathered data, which makes their\
    \ integration into UAV a signiﬁcant solution. A serious\neffort should be considered\
    \ to develop green-federated AI solutions, such as RL, to ensure\naccurate auto-ﬂying\
    \ decisions and path and trajectory planning [35,132].\nScalability: The scalability\
    \ challenges concern resources, applications, load balancing,\nand connections.\
    \ Enabling high scalability requires designing efﬁcient schemes that could\neffectively\
    \ manage heterogeneous mobile devices and servers in a UAV-enabled MEC\nenvironment,\
    \ with its highly dynamic demand behavior. For example, some mobile appli-\ncations,\
    \ such as UAVs and autonomous driving, require high data throughput ofﬂoading\
    \ to\nsuccessfully provide such services, despite heterogeneity in the number\
    \ of mobile devices\nand the dynamic demand behavior of the applications mentioned\
    \ in the MEC environment.\nThe MEC system should have an acceptable degree of\
    \ scalability regarding the number\nof servers and services required. As a result,\
    \ it is challenging for difﬁcult areas to estab-\nlish connections and communications\
    \ between mobile devices and servers. To achieve\nconvenient and cost-effective\
    \ mobility and scalability, resulting in continuous service, it is\nnecessary\
    \ to have a stable connection, even in adverse environmental conditions.\nSecurity:\
    \ Drones enable ubiquitous services on an IoT scale. The communications\nand controls\
    \ are realized through P2P wireless transmissions and thus are open to many\n\
    security threats. Therefore, unauthorized connections threaten the system’s privacy.\
    \ It is\nnecessary to propose and design security mechanisms to improve UAV-enabled\
    \ MEC sys-\ntems’ security [142]. The effort should focus on the physical, application,\
    \ and MAC layers.\nThe solutions should integrate recent robust techniques such\
    \ as blockchains, especially\nin IoT applications where UAVs are expected to facilitate\
    \ communication networks. The\ncombination of UAVs with blockchain and AI is now\
    \ an exciting avenue of research to\npredict all sorts of attacks and malware\
    \ that threaten the system’s privacy [127]. However,\nwhile there has been signiﬁcant\
    \ progress in this area, more work needs to be done. Power\nconsumption might\
    \ be a critical constraint for blockchain-based applications as they need\nmore\
    \ computing power. Increasingly complex attacks, such as quantum attacks, ML,\
    \ and\ntheory-based game attacks, could challenge the privacy of blockchain systems\
    \ [143]. More\nresearch is needed to make private blockchain networks more immutable\
    \ and secure in\nUAV-enabled MEC architectures. Moreover, blockchain-enabled softwarization\
    \ for secure\nUAV network systems is also a critical challenge. Blockchain implementation\
    \ in UAV\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n23 of 30\nsystems presents a complex system integration\
    \ problem requiring rigorous testing before\nconcrete implementation [12].\nIntegration\
    \ of AI schemes: Recently, the utilization of AI schemes among DL, ML, and\nRL\
    \ has become increasingly of interest, to beneﬁt from their powerful performance.\
    \ AI\nschemes are being integrated into UAV-enabled MEC systems as a way to make\
    \ contextual\ndecisions and learn from aggregated data gathered from previous\
    \ tracking experiences. The\ndata collected by the sensors in real-time can be\
    \ proﬁtably exploited for the autonomous\npiloting of UAVs. Therefore, processing\
    \ tasks demand strict computing and storage\nrequirements at computing facilities,\
    \ to be executed exceptionally at the edge. UAVs\nalso have energy and storage\
    \ limitations; thus, portable and lightweight RL, ML, and DL\nalgorithms should\
    \ be designed to cope with these constraints.\nRegulations: Despite the rapid\
    \ emergence of this technology, UAV regulations are\nstill in their infancy, and\
    \ a lack of heterogeneity of national rules and varying levels of\nimplementation\
    \ can be observed. These regulations differ from state to state, and the type\n\
    of regulation is based on the requirements of that use. Several problems are associated\
    \ with\nUAV regulation, including delays in ﬂight approval and poorly documented\
    \ administrative\nprocesses limiting the desired ﬂexibility, preventing widespread\
    \ use of the technology [144].\nLatency and computation issues: Communication\
    \ latency and computing optimization\nremain concerns in MEC-enabled UAV applications,\
    \ affecting transmission efﬁciency and\nreaction time under communication and\
    \ computing constraints. UAV transmission success\nmay be accomplished by offering\
    \ effective methods that decrease response delay. In\none study [145], for example,\
    \ stochastic geometry and queueing theory approaches were\nstudied to minimize\
    \ the response delay for a MEC-enabled UAV network.\nResource allocation: Due\
    \ to UAV battery concerns and trajectory constraints, resource\nallocation is\
    \ critical in UAV-enabled MEC networks. Resources allocation is involved in\n\
    three processes: computing task ofﬂoading, local computing, and UAV hovering.\
    \ Design-\ning an appropriate trajectory can ultimately compromise the calculated\
    \ performance and\noperating costs. According to the authors of [146], resource\
    \ allocation may be structured to\nmeet various goals, including computing bit\
    \ maximization, energy minimization, compu-\ntational efﬁciency maximization,\
    \ cost minimization, completion time minimization, and\nthe consideration of fairness.\n\
    UAV-enabled IoT for B5G and 6G issues: Data-gathering faces several problems in\
    \ IoT\nthat extend beyond the ﬁfth-generation (B5G) and upcoming sixth-generation\
    \ (6G) wireless\nmobile networks. A large amount of data will be generated by\
    \ heterogeneous devices,\nparticularly IoT devices and smartphones at the mobile\
    \ edge; these data are fragmented and\ndispersed among several machines. Therefore,\
    \ distributed solutions such as UAV-enabled\nMEC should be leveraged near mobile\
    \ users to ofﬂoad and process the data. Meanwhile,\ngrowing privacy concerns make\
    \ data collecting increasingly challenging. This consumes\nmore energy and decreases\
    \ the system’s ofﬂoading time [147].\n6. Conclusions\nThe development of wireless\
    \ communication technologies and IT services has made\nthe role of drones more\
    \ ubiquitous in various ﬁelds of application. Drones can serve\nas a link between\
    \ smart devices and cloud data centers, to provide many services that\ncan increase\
    \ the performance of a given IoT system. To the best of our knowledge, this\n\
    paper is considered the ﬁrst work that provides a review of drone-enabled MECs\
    \ based on\nAI. This work discusses the current research trends and provides future\
    \ insights into the\npotential uses of UAV-enabled MEC in the ﬁeld of IoT. It\
    \ highlights the potential roles that\nUAVs can play in enabling communications\
    \ and intelligent computing in the IoT era, by\nreferring to the most widely emerging\
    \ AI techniques that are employed. As mentioned,\nUAVs as MECs are attracting\
    \ considerable interest in scientiﬁc research, to address the\nvarious problems\
    \ and challenges experienced in order to improve the performance of such\napplications\
    \ in different scenarios, such as resource allocation, energy efﬁciency, latency,\n\
    task ofﬂoading, and security. UAV-enabled MEC present an emerging concept that\
    \ require\nDrones 2021, 5, 148\n24 of 30\nmore effort to achieve the necessary\
    \ performance in every scenario of UAV application in\nIoT environments, especially\
    \ regarding MEC.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.Y. carried out this research as part\

  title: 'UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge-Computing for IoT Based on AI: A Comprehensive Review'
  verbatim_quote1: Drones have been used to monitor large agricultural ﬁelds to detect
    speciﬁc diseases that threaten the quality of plants at an early stage. The implemented
    system can predict farm diseases in real-time by exploiting image processing and
    AI classiﬁcation based on IoT architecture, using real-time data acquisition [39].
    In ref. [40], the authors have proposed an architecture combining UAVs and wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) with IoT approaches to provide precise ecological agriculture.
    Another architecture for crop mapping monitoring and disease assessment-based
    satellite imagery using the DL approach has been proposed to analyze the images
    acquired through UAV airborne multispectral sensors [41]. Additionally, UAVs can
    efﬁciently enhance the productivity of farming activities, as referenced in [42–44].
    In addition, UAVs play an exciting role in crop monitoring by facilitating many
    tasks previously restricted to the laborer and farmer [45–47].
  verbatim_quote2: The most prominent communication protocols that can be used with
    UAVs are IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMax), IEEE 802.15.4 (LRWPAN), cellular
    networks (3G/4G), IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), LoRaWAN (LoRa), SigFox and narrowband
    IoT (NB-IoT) [27–31].

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\

    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n3 of 31\nSection 3 discusses relevant approaches to data collection in\
    \ smallholder agriculture.\nWith these, we aim to layout a better insight of the\
    \ target population and bring about\nthe data gaps that needs to be ﬁlled. The\
    \ literature search methodology is explained in\nSection 4. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of the use of IoT and WSN in smallholder agriculture,\nbased on reviewed literature\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework as a standard [57]. The use of IoT and WSN\
    \ for\nagricultural applications was insigniﬁcant until around 2010 and has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsince then. Hence, we searched for publications in the years 2011–2021.\
    \ Research articles,\nsoftware and data publications, white papers and conference\

    \ Further analysis was carried out on these papers to understand the\nhardware\
    \ and technical details. Sensors and nodes used in the work, communication tech-\n\

    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\

    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    \ of IoT is often challenged in smallholder communi-\nties due to poor infrastructure\
    \ and high improvement cost. More cost-effective and less\nresource-hungry solutions\
    \ such as WSN are potential candidates for integration with the\nIoT [107]. Essentially,\
    \ the low-power wireless communications contribute to improving\nboth IoT device\
    \ connections with the Internet and the overall efﬁciency of the IoT applica-\n\
    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\
    Figure 4. Thematic distribution of reviewed papers (N = 53) depicting important\
    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\
    \ edge and cloud computing based anomaly detection in WSN is\npresented in [140].\n\
    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\
    investigation result of the work is to be communicated soon.\nFunding: This study\

    for IoT-based precision agriculture systems. The approach is validated using real-world
    data collected from a coconut field, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving

    \ and applications has increased data\nprocessing and storage requirements. The\
    \ Edge computing concept aims to leverage the processing\ncapabilities of the\
    \ IoT and other devices placed at the edge of the network. One embodiment of\n\
    this paradigm is Fog computing, which provides an intermediate and often hierarchical\
    \ processing\ntier between the data sources and the remote Cloud. Among the major\
    \ beneﬁts of this concept, the\nend-to-end latency can be decreased, thus favoring\
    \ time-sensitive applications. Moreover, the data\ntrafﬁc at the network core\
    \ and the Cloud computing workload can be reduced. Combining the Fog\ncomputing\
    \ paradigm with Complex Event Processing (CEP) and data fusion techniques has\
    \ excellent\npotential for generating valuable knowledge and aiding decision-making\
    \ processes in the Internet of\nThings’ systems. In this context, we propose a\
    \ multi-tier complex event processing approach (sensor\nnode, Fog, and Cloud)\
    \ that promotes fast decision making and is based on information with 98%\naccuracy.\
    \ The experiments show a reduction of 77% in the average time of sending messages\
    \ in the\nnetwork. In addition, we achieved a reduction of 82% in data trafﬁc.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; Fog computing; complex event processing\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to [1], the Internet of Things (IoT) environment is composed of physical\n\
    and virtual entities where physical entities turn into virtual things inside a\
    \ cyber-world.\nThese things are embedded with different abilities such as sensing,\
    \ analyzing, processing,\nand self-management capacities. By adopting interoperable\
    \ communication protocols,\nthese smart things should have unique identities and\
    \ virtual personalities. The recent\ngrowth of Internet services and applications\
    \ has contributed to increasing data processing\nand storage requirements. Such\
    \ requirements are diverse in terms of the required resources\nby different applications,\
    \ thus calling for customized solutions.\nEdge computing recently emerged to overcome\
    \ some drawbacks of using Cloud\ncomputing as a back-end platform for IoT. Such\
    \ drawbacks include its unpredictable\nlatency, lack of location awareness and\
    \ user mobility [2]. The Edge computing concept\naims to leverage the processing\
    \ capabilities of IoT devices by using gateways, base stations,\nand other Edge\
    \ devices, providing an intermediate tier between the end-devices (data\nproducers/consumers)\
    \ and the remote Cloud. The presence of Edge devices enables the\nlocal processing\
    \ of requests, reducing the Cloud computing workload and application\nresponse\
    \ time.\nThe Edge computing paradigm has been applied to several emerging scenarios\
    \ and\nadopted by IoT applications that are time-critical and have sensitive data\
    \ (in terms of\nprivacy). One embodiment of this paradigm is Fog computing. Fog\
    \ computing denotes a\ndecentralized computing infrastructure consisting of processing\
    \ nodes placed anywhere on\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21217226\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n2 of 22\nthe continuum\
    \ between the end-devices and the Cloud. According to [3], Fog is a “cloud\nclosest\
    \ to the ground”. It extends the traditional Cloud computing architecture to the\
    \ edge\nof the network, enabling the processing and analyzing of some data at\
    \ that tier. The Fog\narchitecture is generally composed of at least three tiers.\
    \ The low tier consists of IoT devices\nthat collect, pre-process and forward\
    \ data to the Fog nodes. The middle tier comprises Fog\nnodes (with a higher processing\
    \ power than the IoT devices) that perform data processing,\ndecision making,\
    \ and actuation. The Cloud stores information and processes data that Fog\nnodes\
    \ did not have enough computing resources to process in the upper tier.\nFog computing\
    \ bridges the gap between the Cloud and end-devices (e.g., IoT nodes)\nby enabling\
    \ computing, storage, networking, and data management on network nodes\nwithin\
    \ the close vicinity of IoT devices. Consequently, computation, storage, networking,\n\
    decision making, and data management occur not only in the Cloud but also along\
    \ the\nIoT-to-Cloud path as data traverses to the Cloud (preferably close to the\
    \ IoT devices) [4].\nOne of the main differences between Cloud and Fog computing\
    \ concerns the scale of\nhardware components associated with these computing paradigms.\
    \ Cloud computing\nprovides highly available computing resources at relatively\
    \ high power consumption,\nwhereas Fog computing provides moderate availability\
    \ of computing resources at lower\npower consumption [5].\nTo perform raw data\
    \ processing in the Fog and Cloud tier some techniques can be\napplied aiming\
    \ to extract meaningful information, thus generating knowledge. In addition,\n\
    other techniques are often used to perform pre-processing functions, with different\
    \ goals,\nsuch as spurious data ﬁltering and dimensional reduction. Data pre-processing\
    \ techniques\ncan help improve the quality of the data produced while reducing\
    \ the use of resources\nin processing tasks. A widely adopted technique in both\
    \ the steps of sensor data pre-\nprocessing and processing is data fusion. Data\
    \ fusion [6] can be understood as a process of\naggregating and combining data\
    \ from multiple sources to prevent redundancy and reduce\nthe response time. It\
    \ can also improve data accuracy by using data from various sources to\ncompose\
    \ complete information. In addition to data fusion, complex event processing (CEP)\n\
    techniques also contribute to improving the information generated by sensors.\
    \ CEP goes\nbeyond simple data query and transformation and aims to detect patterns\
    \ in the data using\nﬁltering techniques, correlation, and creating new, composite\
    \ events from simple ones.\nIn this context, this work proposes a multi-tier approach\
    \ for complex event processing\nin Fog-based IoT systems. Our approach aims to\
    \ process events based on sensing data\nwith low response time and high accuracy.\
    \ One of the goals of our proposal is to reduce\nthe number of messages exchanged\
    \ between the sensed area and the Cloud. The main idea\nis to identify a simple\
    \ event that triggers the complex event processing, aiming to identify\nthe nodes\
    \ related to the event and extract the characteristics of the sensed location.\
    \ In this\nway, information is processed in different tiers, according to the\
    \ capacity of each device,\noptimizing the use of computational resources and\
    \ decreasing the average response time,\nboth between the sensor and the Fog tier\
    \ and between the Fog tier and the Cloud. The data\nare collected, managed, and\
    \ processed according to the application requirements and in\na decentralized\
    \ way. Different tiers are responsible for the collection, analysis, decision\n\
    making, and support of IoT systems. Aiming to harness the intrinsic capabilities\
    \ of the Fog\ncomputing environment, this approach also explores the typical concept\
    \ of the geolocation\nFog enhanced with an information context to consolidate\
    \ the data in the Fog nodes. Sensor\nnodes are selected and orchestrated using\
    \ their distance to the Fog node and the type of\nsensed data. So, our geographical\
    \ distributed and context-aware approach can help to\nimprove low latency and\
    \ consistent data access.\nThe main contribution of this work is the proposal\
    \ of a hierarchical approach of\na complex event processing (CEP) mechanism aiming\
    \ to (i) reduce data exchange and\nresponse time and (ii) increase information\
    \ accuracy to make timely decisions and support\na complete data processing workﬂow\
    \ for smart agriculture applications.\nThus, among the advantages of our CEP approach\
    \ in three tiers, we can cite:\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n3 of 22\n•\nThe CEP mechanisms\
    \ distributed in the network are capable of load balancing with\nless processing\
    \ power, generating complex events, and processing them in tiers with\ngreater\
    \ processing power;\n•\nA new CEP mechanism can be implemented in the event of\
    \ an increase in data volume,\nchanging only the tier of the hierarchy in question;\n\
    •\nNetwork trafﬁc to transfer information between tiers can be signiﬁcantly reduced,\n\
    sending only the data necessary for processing events at the appropriate tiers.\n\
    We simulated scenarios in precision agriculture to evaluate the proposed approach.\
    \ It\nwas tailored to the requirements of IoT applications from the smart agriculture\
    \ domain.\nThe experiments show a reduction of 77% in the average time of sending\
    \ messages in\nthe network and 82% of improvement in the throughput using the\
    \ proposed approach\ncompared to systems without our proposal. Additionally, tests\
    \ were conducted to validate\nthe proposed complex event processing engine.\n\
    This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents and discusses the related\
    \ work.\nThe proposed approach is presented in Section 3, and Section 4 covers\
    \ the materials and\nmethods. The results are discussed in Section 5. Finally,\
    \ Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Related Work\nManaging data acquired by a\
    \ vast array of heterogeneous sensors remains as complex\nas the knowledge needed\
    \ to make a decision on the practices of an agricultural process.\nThis is mainly\
    \ due to the fact that processing is required in the various temporal and spatial\n\
    dimensions of the acquired data. This task implies that data should become available\
    \ in\na suitable time window and format to be viewed and stored, but also to feed\
    \ decision-\nmaking support systems. Managing data and extracting timely information\
    \ is also quickly\nbecoming a key issue. In this context, the authors in [7] proposed\
    \ a universal CEP mech-\nanism for IoT monitoring using Edge computing. In addition,\
    \ a formalized hierarchical\ncomplex event model is created, including raw, simple,\
    \ and complex events, to reduce the\ncomplexity of event modeling. The model uses\
    \ complex time and space semantics to deﬁne\nﬂexible events through algorithms.\
    \ The authors in [8] use a hybrid approach, in which\ntwo data processing tiers,\
    \ the Edge-tier and Cloud-tier, work together to provide effective\nIoT data analysis.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, raw data are locally collected at IoT devices. Features are\nextracted\
    \ by performing data fusion techniques in devices with greater processing power\n\
    and then sending the result to the Cloud.\nThe work described in [9] addresses\
    \ the hierarchical data fusion in IoT networks that\ncontain Edge devices, network\
    \ and communication units, and Cloud platforms. Different\ndata sources are combined\
    \ at each tier to produce timely and accurate results. The work\npresented in\
    \ [10] proposes utilizing complex event processing and a hierarchical distributed\n\
    architecture for enabling data fusion at various levels. To this purpose, their\
    \ paper intro-\nduces complex event processing (CEP) as a potential way of implementing\
    \ sensor data\nfusion in distributed IoT systems. Aiming to leverage local processing\
    \ capabilities wher-\never possible, or off-load tasks to Edge/Cloud computing\
    \ otherwise—thereby paving the\nway for a multi-layered, hierarchical data fusion\
    \ approach, aiming to reduce the network’s\nresponse time and amounts of transferred\
    \ data. Another work dealing with a large amount\nof data is [11], where a new\
    \ computing paradigm was proposed, designed to process\nBig Data in a collaborative\
    \ Edge (CEE) environment. The work proposed the fusion of\ngeographically distributed\
    \ data, creating shared virtual visualizations of the data exposed\nto the end-users\
    \ through interfaces predeﬁned by the data owners.\nIn [12], the authors proposed\
    \ and analyzed a CEP-based Fog architecture for real-time\nIoT applications that\
    \ uses a publish–subscribe protocol. A testbed was developed with\nlow-cost and\
    \ local resources to verify the suitability of CEP-engines to low-cost comput-\n\
    ing resources. To assess the performance, they analyzed the effectiveness and\
    \ cost of\nthe proposal in terms of latency and resource usage, respectively.\
    \ In [13], a weighted\ncost model is proposed to minimize IoT applications’ execution\
    \ time and energy con-\nsumption in a computing environment with multiple IoT\
    \ devices, multiple Fog/Edge\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n4 of 22\nservers, and Cloud\
    \ servers. In addition, a new application placement technique based\non the Memetic\
    \ Algorithm is proposed to make batch application placement decisions\nfor concurrent\
    \ IoT applications. Due to the heterogeneity of IoT applications, they also\n\
    proposed a lightweight pre-scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of parallel\
    \ tasks\nfor concurrent execution.\nIn [14], the authors proposed a scalable network\
    \ architecture for monitoring and\ncontrolling agriculture in rural areas. Compared\
    \ to the existing IoT-based farming solutions,\nthe proposed solution reduces\
    \ network latency up to a certain extent. In that paper,\na cross-layer-based\
    \ channel access and routing solution for sensing and actuating were\nproposed.\
    \ The work of [15] used innovative platform technology to be applied to the Cloud\n\
    agriculture platform. Cloud integration can be applied to large-area data collection\
    \ and\nanalysis, allowing farmland with limited network information resources\
    \ to be integrated\nand automated. Those improvements, including agricultural\
    \ monitoring automation, pest\nmanagement image analysis, and monitoring can also\
    \ be used to solve the predicament of\nlarge-area automation construction.\nMore\
    \ speciﬁcally on precision agriculture, the authors of [16] proposed a framework\n\
    designed to provide a complete farming ecosystem. The framework facilitates the\

    \ mentioned above have contributed to improving Fog computing and\nCEP performance\

    \ without hierarchical or speciﬁc description mechanisms. Therefore, focusing\n\
    on the event model, data fusion, and information quality remain the unsolved technical\n\

    performed to evaluate our approach performance regarding data trafﬁc, decision\

    \ in [19], based on the data type\n(redundant, cooperative, and complementary)\
    \ is used in conjunction with the classiﬁcation\nbased on abstraction tiers (low,\
    \ medium, and high). In addition, the proposal includes the\nintegration of the\

    \ quality\nby adding information to the observed data;\n•\nA new CEP mechanism\
    \ can be implemented in the event of an increase in the volume\nof data, changing\

    \ Processing Approach\nModern IoT systems tend to go beyond the notion of “bottom–up”\
    \ monitoring. Thus,\nsensing devices are not only in charge of collecting raw\
    \ data and transferring it over\nthe network. They also implemented a “descendant”\
    \ feedback communication between\nthe network tiers (e.g., for decision making\
    \ based on data). The proposed approach\nuses coordination functionality as part\
    \ of this two-way communication responsible for\ncommunication between the tiers\
    \ described. More speciﬁcally, coordination is a two-way\nfunctionality. On the\
    \ one hand, the Fog device receives data from lower-tier devices,\ncollecting\
    \ and dispatching to processors and data fusion engines at the upper tier if\n\
    necessary. On the other hand, the Fog device sends the new processing rules to\
    \ the lower\ntiers according to the changes observed in the data behavior. Thus,\
    \ the proposed conceptual\napproach comprises the implementation and execution\
    \ tiers of complex event processing\nin devices. Figure 1 describes the separation\
    \ conceptual of tasks at all three tiers. These\ntasks have dedicated instances\
    \ of data fusion (DF) mechanisms: low tier (LDF), medium\ntier (MDF), and high\
    \ tier (HDF) data fusion [9]. The two top tiers include coordination\ncomponents\
    \ (LDF and MDF coordinators), responsible for bidirectional communication\nbetween\
    \ the lower and upper-tier nodes and managing requests from the lower-tier nodes.\n\
    The architecture of our proposal (Figure 1) is composed of three different tiers\
    \ which\nprocess simple and complex events from several different sources. The\
    \ low-tier devices\n(IoT devices) collect data from the real world (for example,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature).\nA relatively limited fusion technique (a simple\
    \ aggregation such as simple or weighted\narithmetic averages) was performed at\
    \ this tier. Then, the result was sent to the medium\ntier (Fog node). This aspect\
    \ reduces the data ﬂow in the sensor tier, the network segment\nwith less transmission\
    \ capacity. The Fog node is located close to the IoT devices or along the\ncommunication\
    \ path to the Cloud nodes. Fog node performs a complementary fusion of all\ndata\
    \ received by the sensor nodes using event processing techniques, thus allowing\
    \ local\ndecision making regarding the sensed area with low latency. It is essential\
    \ to highlight that\na Fog node has fewer resources than a Cloud node and just\
    \ local knowledge, unlike Cloud\nnodes. Therefore, a Fog node can apply less sophisticated\
    \ data fusion algorithms than\nthose of a Cloud node. However, a Fog node can\
    \ use more complex algorithms than an IoT\ndevice because it has a broader computational\
    \ capacity to process and fuse information\nand receives a higher amount of data\
    \ from different sources. Furthermore, if necessary,\nthe Fog node can also directly\
    \ act on the sensed area, aiming to reduce latency. Finally,\nthe Fog node sends\
    \ the data transformed by the data fusion and CEP methods to the high\ntier (Cloud\
    \ node), which, according to the application, may be responsible for persistently\n\
    storing the data and creating global inferences.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n6 of\
    \ 22\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture for multi-tier hierarchical CEP approach.\n\
    Our approach is also composed of geolocation and context-aware sensor nodes. In\
    \ this\nway, when a new sensor node connects to the network, it is associated\
    \ with a speciﬁc Fog\nbased on its location and context information. For this\
    \ purpose, the nodes start sending a\nbroadcast message to the Fog nodes which\
    \ includes its coordinates (latitude and longitude)\nand the type of data collected.\
    \ If the Fog node is compatible with a datum type, it calculates\nthe Euclidean\
    \ distance between them and sends the data to the Cloud node. For better\ncomprehension,\
    \ we exemplify a sensor that sends temperature data to only connect to\na Fog\
    \ node that processes temperature data. The Cloud node checks the Fog with the\n\
    lowest distance calculated and returns this information to the corresponding Fog\
    \ node.\nIn turn, the Fog node forwards the information to the sensor node. Then,\
    \ the sensor node\nonly sends the collected data to the corresponding Fog, so\
    \ it is processed according to the\napproach requests.\nOur proposal uses the\
    \ CEP model of rules presented in [20] and according to the\nfollowing mechanisms:\n\
    1.\nA simple event is extracted from the result of the simple fusion of the collected\
    \ raw\ndata; the aggregation was performed on a number N of sensor readings;\n\
    2.\nIn the Fog tier, a rule mechanism describes the events generated from the\
    \ received\nvalue. The aggregation performed at the IoT device tier can trigger\
    \ other different\nevents based on the obtained result. An example in the agriculture\
    \ domain would\nbe a temperature change. If the value has not changed since the\
    \ last data were sent,\nthen an event that results in a message being sent should\
    \ be triggered; if changed,\nthe calculation of a daily irrigation event should\
    \ be triggered;\n3.\nThe set of simple events is aggregated, generating more complex\
    \ events, and the Fog\nprocesses the event according to the deﬁned rules;\n4.\n\
    Depending on the event complexity, whenever an event requires a global view, a\
    \ new\nevent sends the data to be processed in the Cloud.\nAccording to [21],\
    \ these four mechanisms can be denominated: data receiver, rule\nmechanism, event\
    \ executor, and event forwarder. We highlight that the processing of\nseveral\
    \ simple events is complex event processing. Figure 2 exempliﬁes the multi-tier\n\
    CEP mechanism.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n7 of 22\nFigure 2. Example of the multi-tier\
    \ CEP mechanism.\nSensor nodes are associated with a speciﬁc Fog node according\
    \ to their characteristics,\nsuch as location and context. For this connection,\
    \ when a sensor node is added to the\nnetwork, it sends a broadcast message to\
    \ the Fog nodes, including coordinates’ parameters\n(latitude and longitude values)\
    \ and the type of data collected. If the Fog node is compatible\n(same type),\
    \ it calculates the Euclidean distance between them and sends its calculated\n\
    value to the Cloud node. This is necessary because the Cloud is the only tier\
    \ with a\nglobal knowledge of the network since the Fog nodes do not communicate\
    \ with each other.\nThe data compatibility is related to the data type that the\
    \ Fog can process. For example,\nan IoT device sending temperature data will only\
    \ connect to a Fog node that processes\ntemperature data. The Cloud node veriﬁes\
    \ the nearest Fog based on the lowest calculated\ndistance value and returns this\
    \ information to the corresponding Fog node. The Fog node,\nin turn, forwards\
    \ this information to the IoT device.\nUsing the CEP mechanism, we can separate\
    \ the process of knowledge generation into\npartial processing and decision making.\
    \ Thus, not only processing but network latency was\nalso reduced. For example,\
    \ when detecting an “abnormal” temperature, the sensor only\nsends the data to\
    \ the decision-making part, which handles tasks of semantic reasoning,\nsuch as\
    \ correlating the data received. In general, the CEP technique can be seen as\
    \ a\nmethod that receives and correlates a set of simple events generating complex\
    \ events.\nThus, it is responsible for detecting simple events, using a cycle\
    \ of ﬁltering, correlation,\ncontextualization, and data analysis from different\
    \ sources.\n3.1. Description of Application Rules and Events: Precision Agriculture\n\
    In the agricultural sector, achieving maximum crop yield at minimum cost is a\
    \ produc-\ntion goal. In this context, decision-making is complex, as several\
    \ factors affect the entire\nprocess, aiming to save water resources, mainly on\
    \ irrigation.\nThe study of water in the soil is of great interest to agriculture\
    \ because it affects the\ndevelopment and production of crops. A developing plant\
    \ must supply the atmosphere’s\ndemand for water through the amount it can extract\
    \ from the soil. Soil water storage\nis reduced by evapotranspiration and replaced\
    \ by precipitation or irrigation. Thus, soil\nwater storage and availability in\
    \ crop production are valuable, and characterizing the\nsoil properties responsible\
    \ for water retention is crucial. The soil moisture is estimated\nusing three\
    \ tensiometers at different soil depths in each monitoring point, which is used\
    \ to\nestimate the soil matric potential. The matric potential is directly linked\
    \ to moisture; the\nmore humid the soil, the greater its potential [22].\nIrrigation\
    \ helps reserve enough water for the crop in its development stage. Its matric\n\
    potential is used in irrigation management to determine when to irrigate, the\
    \ amount of\nwater, and the type of irrigation. The water distribution is on-demand,\
    \ i.e., when water\nis always available by the irrigation project or pumped by\
    \ the user and used when the\ncrop needs.\nThe irrigation management determines\
    \ irrigation timing by monitoring the soil ma-\ntric potential (ψ) containing\
    \ the highest concentration of crop roots (usually in the most\nsuperﬁcial soil\
    \ tier, monitored by the tensiometer). Another way to determine the time to\n\
    irrigate is through the critical moisture θcr, also called ideal moisture for\
    \ irrigation. This\nparameter is the soil water content from which the crop yield\
    \ starts to be reduced, also\nhaving the possibility of evapotranspiration reduction\
    \ (water consumption by cultivation).\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n8 of 22\nθcr is\
    \ only needed for the most superﬁcial soil tier. The evapotranspiration measures\
    \ the\nwater consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage of the\
    \ crop and weather\nconditions [22].\nAnother important variable to be considered\
    \ in view of the plant’s needs is the\nirrigation water need (IWN). The IWN consists\
    \ of the water provided entirely by irrigation\nto compensate for the water loss\
    \ due to evaporation. It is obtained through a calculation\nconsidering the rainfall,\
    \ water consumption, soil moisture at the crop root zone and the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ the irrigation system placed in the ﬁeld [22].\nSimilarly to the works in [23,24],\
    \ we can also detect anomalies in sensor measures\nby comparing with measures\
    \ from nearby sensors, in order to verify whether there was a\nsensor error, whether\
    \ there is any water leakage, or whether, for some reason, the soil is\ntoo dry.\n\
    Based on these concepts, we deﬁne the rules and events of the case study presented\
    \ in\nthe following sections.\n3.2. Rules and Events\nThe rules deﬁned to manage\
    \ the events are divided into two sets: monitoring rules\nand critical state rules.\
    \ Each rule consists of a set of events that are executed according to\nits pattern\
    \ and transformation primitives. These events are allocated to the tiers according\n\
    to the capacity of the devices so that the approach performance is not affected.\
    \ Thus,\nthey directly inﬂuence the process of decision making by the user and\
    \ also automatically\naccording to the system’s behavior.\n3.2.1. Monitoring Rules\n\
    The ﬁrst set of events of the monitoring rule are based on the primitives of ﬁltration,\n\
    aggregation, and projection. They are performed at the sensor tier. The projection\
    \ is\nresponsible for creating complex events (processed in the Fog tier) using\
    \ a subset of its\nattributes, generated by aggregation (average of values obtained\
    \ by the sensors) and by\nﬁltering (obtaining the maximum and minimum values).\
    \ The rule of this ﬁrst set was\ncomposed of the following events:\n•\nEV1 (Simple):\
    \ low matric potential alert;\n•\nEV2 (Simple): high matric potential alert;\n\
    •\nEV3 (Simple): daily matric potential sending alert + sensor ID.\nThe second\
    \ set is formed by simple and compound events based on the primitives of\naggregation,\
    \ enrichment, and composition performed in the Fog tier. Enrichment is the\nconference\
    \ of the data necessary for calculations. Composition is the computations made\n\
    from the data consulted. The events that compose this rule are:\n•\nEV4 (Complex):\
    \ matric potential variation ;\n•\nEV5 (Complex): daily irrigation water needed\
    \ (IWN);\n•\nEV6 (Complex): daily irrigation frequency veriﬁcation.\nThe outputs\
    \ of these events are messages displayed and sent to the user.\n3.2.2. Critical\
    \ State Rules\nThe critical state rule is composed of events based on the primitives\
    \ of enrichment,\ncomposition, negation and sequence performed at the Fog tier.\
    \ For the use of the sequence\nprimitive, an input control is necessary, which\
    \ can be done through a time window, using a\ntimestamp, or context, using an\
    \ event identiﬁer. This rule consists of the following events:\n•\nEV7 (Complex):\
    \ critical soil moisture (ideal for irrigation);\n•\nEV8 (Complex): maximum water\
    \ deﬁcit.\nThese events result in automatic actions in the monitored area.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 7226\n9 of 22\n3.3. CEP Architecture\nThe proposed complex events\
    \ processing (CEP) model is part of the data fusion\nmechanism to treat, analyze,\
    \ and react to data ﬂows as events. Event ﬂows are the primary\nsources of input\
    \ of the CEP model. The events are created through producers (sensors,\nusers)\
    \ that provide the data. The ﬂow of events is processed through the CEP event\n\
    processing agent, known as EPA. Speciﬁcally, the EPA follows the subsequent steps:\
    \ reacts\nto events, analyzes, and manipulates them according to deﬁned rules,\
    \ and, if necessary,\ngenerates derivative (complex) events for the consumers.\
    \ The EPA acts according to the\nprimitives deﬁned in each example, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3 and 4.\nFigure 3. CEP architecture and primitives.\nFigure 4. CEP\
    \ primitives CEP according with tiers.\nA CEP inference engine allows instantiating\
    \ the presented concepts. In addition, it\nprovides operations to deﬁne the types\
    \ of events (schema and payload) and primitives\nin real-time to express continuous\
    \ queries (PAEs) and interconnect them. The inference\nengines of the events are\
    \ shown in Section 3.3.1.\n3.3.1. Description of CEP Rules and Events\nWe show\

    \ to comple-\nment this set of rules and events. The event-processing programming\
    \ differs from regular\nprogramming and thus needs its own auditing tool. Auditing\
    \ is the ability to investigate\nwhether processes have been properly applied.\
    \ The investigation may refer to whether a\nprocess complies with external regulations\
    \ or internal policies or whether a decision has\nbeen appropriately made.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Auditing\nGiven the rules and events presented in Section 3.3.1, we performed\
    \ the auditing of\nthe CEP model using a static analysis of the network. The auditing\
    \ process for a CEP model\nis based on the event log, a list that retains the\
    \ raw and derived events performed in the\ngiven processing. The audit was made\
    \ based on consultations in this event log. The query\nis similar to the dynamic\
    \ analysis process of the validation process, as it depends on the\namount of\
    \ information from the execution of a given event.\nFor the auditing of the CEP\
    \ model, two primary consultations were performed based\non the concept presented\
    \ in [25]: (i) consult all antecedents of a given event or activation of\nan EPA\
    \ instance (rule); and (ii) consult all the consequences of a given event or activation\n\
    of an EPA instance (rule).\nWe can observe from these two main consultations that\
    \ the objective of the audit is\nto check the background and consequences of a\
    \ given processed event, i.e., to check the\nbackground of the ﬁnalizing events\
    \ and the consequences of the initial events. Thus, for the\nmodel applied to\
    \ the approach proposed in this article, it is necessary to audit the following\n\
    events:\n•\nConsult 1: EV4, EV6, EV7, and EV8.\n•\nConsult 2: EV1, EV2, and EV3.\n\
    Figures 5–7 present the logs of the consulted events. From the logs, we can verify\n\
    that event processing is meeting the application’s needs. Exemplifying the Event\
    \ 1 log\n(Figure 5), the expected performance according to the low matric potential\
    \ is irrigation\nunless a sensor malfunction has occurred. Then, following the\
    \ processing of event 1, it\nends by triggering event 4 in case the rule is activated.\
    \ Now, observing the log presented\nin Figure 6, we veriﬁed that this event ends\
    \ by exactly meeting the need to trigger event 1:\nor ends by sending a message\
    \ to the user informing of the sensor malfunction, or sending\na message to trigger\
    \ manual irrigation, or, ﬁnally, triggering event 8. Event 10 checks\nthe activation\
    \ of the EPA instance, testing the rule, and ends with the triggering of the\n\
    automatic irrigation or requesting that the same be done manually, as we can see\
    \ in the log\nof Figure 7.\nFigure 5. Log of events 1, 2, and 3.\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 7226\n12 of 22\nFigure 6. Log of event 4.\nFigure 7. Logs of events 6, 7,\
    \ and 8.\nThus, based on any consult executed in the logs presented, the application’s\
    \ need is\nsatisﬁed at the end of the processing—starting from event 2 (Figure\
    \ 5) and ending at event\n4 (Figure 6), etc. In this way, the audit of the CEP\
    \ model used in the proposed approach\nwas successfully satisﬁed.\n4. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the performed experiments. We divided them\
    \ into two experi-\nmental groups, with different goals. The ﬁrst group refers\
    \ to the experiments performed to\nanalyze the proposal’s performance using the\
    \ metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score,\ndata trafﬁc, and time to\
    \ send packages. The second group refers to the implementation\nof the rules responsible\
    \ for controlling the irrigation process, the validation of the soil\nmoisture\
    \ management, and the reaction time of the actuators to verify the response time\n\
    and the CEP efﬁciency. Table 2 summarizes the experiments, objectives, and metrics.\n\

    \ ﬁrst performance evaluation, executed to verify the quality\nof the decision\
    \ generated and the performance in terms of data trafﬁc and average sending\n\
    time with the application of the CEP approach. Both aspects are critical to assess\
    \ the\nperformance of the large-scale deployment of wireless sensors. To create\
    \ a proof of concept\n(PoC) of our proposal, we used a real coconut ﬁeld of Embrapa\
    \ Agroindustrial [26] as a\nmodel to simulate an environment for our experiments.\
    \ The experimental ﬁeld is located\nin Paraipaba-Ce.\nExperiment I: Design\nOur\
    \ simulated ﬁeld consists of 25 coconut trees, in which temperature sensors monitor\n\
    ﬁfteen trees, and soil moisture sensors monitor ten trees. In addition, ﬁve Fog\
    \ nodes\ncommunicating with the Cloud were implemented. Furthermore, we simulated\
    \ two other\nscenarios to verify the approach’s scalability by varying the number\
    \ of nodes as follows:\n(i) 50 sensor nodes (25 temperature, 25 soil moisture)\
    \ and 10 Fog nodes; and (ii) 100 sensor\nnodes (50 temperature, 50 soil moisture)\
    \ and 20 Fog nodes.\nWe used a discrete event simulator focused on, but not restricted\
    \ to, Fog environments,\ncalled Yet Another Fog Simulator (YAFS) to run the simulations.\
    \ YAFS was built to ana-\nlyze the application’s design and it incorporates strategies\
    \ for positioning, programming,\nand routing. YAFS has similar characteristics\
    \ to the iFogSim simulator and uses it as a\nreference [27]. According to [28],\
    \ iFogSim is one of the most widely used Fog simulators for\nscenario simulations\
    \ using Fog and Cloud computing. YAFS includes more functionality\nthan current\
    \ simulators for modeling IoT scenarios and is easier to add extensions. We\n\
    highlight the following points of YAFS:\n•\nIt provides a network vision that\
    \ allows the modeling of the communication links\namong machines, users and end-devices;\n\
    •\nEach workload source represents the connection of a user or an IoT sensor or\
    \ actuator\nthat demands a service and can be created, changed or dynamically\
    \ removed, enabling\nthe modeling of the user movements in an ecosystem;\n•\n\
    Custom processes can be invoked at runtime to provide ﬂexible implementations\
    \ of\nreal events;\n•\nIt provides post-simulation data analysis based on two\
    \ types of events: workload\ngeneration and computation, and link transmissions.\n\
    The sensor readings were carried out over a 20-min time frame so that we capture\n\
    the hourly average. Every twelve hours, the sensor node performs a simple aggregation\n\
    function, calculating the arithmetic mean. Then, each sensor sends the value to\
    \ its respective\nFog node. Then, the Fog node transforms the received data into\
    \ information using data\nfusion and CEP techniques such as ﬁltering and composing\
    \ complex events. CEP works\nas an inference engine, ﬁltering, correlating, and\
    \ composing new events based on the\ninformation obtained through the fusion of\
    \ the data. For example, after consecutive\nreadings of temperature values greater\
    \ than 29 ºC, an event is created that exhibits a\ntemperature alert message on\
    \ display. Likewise, a new event is created to send an urgent\nmessage to prevent\
    \ the soil from becoming too dry after displaying ﬁve messages without\nchange\
    \ in the monitored area (without action).\nThe sensor nodes have 16 MB RAM, while\
    \ Fog nodes have 4 GB and Cloud nodes\nhave 8 GB. These values were chosen to\
    \ be realistic, closer to the device’s conﬁguration\noften used. Thus, each sensor\
    \ node is connected to a Fog node, while each Fog node is\nconnected to the Cloud\
    \ node. For simulation purposes, only one Cloud node was used in\nall scenarios.\
    \ The parameters conﬁgured in the experiments performed are summarized in\nTable\
    \ 3.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n14 of 22\nTable 3. Experiments.\nExperiment\nScenario\n\

    \ Nodes\nScalability\n20 Fog Nodes\nTo better understanding the metrics of quality\
    \ decisions, the basic knowledge of\neach concept is necessary. False positives\
    \ and false negatives are illustrated utilizing\nthe confusion matrix, a table\
    \ indicating the errors and successes of the evaluated model,\ncomparing them\
    \ with the expected result. In this matrix, the following values are shown:\n\
    •\nTrue positive (TP): values that correspond to the positive of the value read;\
    \ in the case\nof the architecture presented, the value must be within the normal\
    \ temperature range\n(up to 29 ºC) and acceptable humidity (greater than or equal\
    \ to 60 KPa);\n•\nFalse negative (FN): error in which the model predicted a negative\
    \ result (that is,\noutside the normal temperature range or acceptable soil moisture)\
    \ when the real value\nwas within the positive range (described above);\n•\nFalse\
    \ positive (FP): error in which the model predicted a positive result when the\
    \ real\nvalue was within the negative range (that is, temperature > 29 ◦C or soil\
    \ moisture\n< 60 KPa);\n•\nTrue negative (TN): correct classiﬁcation of values\
    \ within the high temperature range\n(greater than 29 ◦C) or dry soil (less than\
    \ 60 KPa) before and after the data fusion\nis applied.\nWhen all the terms (TP,\
    \ FN, FP, and TN) are computed, resulting in the confusion\nmatrices, it is possible\
    \ to calculate the following metrics for assessing the quality of the\ndata: accuracy\
    \ (Ac); precision (P); recall (R); and F1-Score (F1) using the Equations (1)–(4):\n\
    Ac =\nTP + TN\nTP + FP + TN + FN\n(1)\nP =\nTP\nTP + FP\n(2)\nR =\nTP\nTP + FN\n\
    (3)\nF1 = 2 × P × R\nP + R\n(4)\nRegarding these metrics, accuracy provides a\
    \ general analysis of the model considering\nall the data collected; this metric\
    \ indicates the percentage of data that were correctly\nclassiﬁed. The precision\
    \ metric provides a percentage of how many positive instances were\ncorrectly\
    \ ranked, while the Recall metric was used to indicate the relationship between\n\
    positive predictions performed correctly and all data that are actually positive.\
    \ The F1-score\nmetric indicates the overall behavior of accuracy and recall.\
    \ If the F1-score is low, it is\nunderstood that one of the two metrics is low.\
    \ Regarding this last metric, it is important to\nhighlight the harmonic mean\
    \ of accuracy and recall. When the values are close, the result\nis similar to\
    \ the arithmetic mean [29].\n4.2. Experiment 2: Validation of CEP Model Implementation\
    \ and Reaction Time\nThis section presents the implementation of rules directly\
    \ linked to irrigation control\nand the validation of its effectiveness using\
    \ a program that simulates the sensors and the\nsoil matric potential values in\
    \ real time.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n15 of 22\nExperiment 2: Design\nFigure 8\
    \ shows the components implemented for Experiment 2, where sensors and\nactuators\
    \ nodes exchange information with the Fog tier. We used three soil moisture\n\
    sensors and an actuator that controls irrigation in the zone in the ﬁeld. We used\
    \ Python to\nsimulate both components, with soil conditions and moisture progression\
    \ according to the\nirrigation state (on or off). The Fog tier comprises two components:\
    \ a Rabbitmq messaging\nserver containing two queues (data input and output) and\
    \ a module dedicated to the data\nstream and complex event processing (CEP), which\
    \ was implemented using Apache Flink\nthe FlinkCEP library. Communication between\
    \ the Fog tier and the IoT nodes in the ﬁeld\nwas through the MQTT protocol. Rabbitmq\
    \ was chosen as the messaging service because\nthe tool provides a native plugin\
    \ that supports MQTT messages.\nFigure 8. Experiment 2: implementation of Fog\
    \ tier components.\nIn order to validate the effectiveness of the rules implemented\
    \ in Apache Flink in\ncontrolling irrigation, we programmed the sensors to send\
    \ the matric potential values\nevery minute to the Fog tier. Upon detecting event\
    \ 9 or 10, the irrigation was turned on. We\nused the value of 20 kPa as a reference\
    \ for the ideal value of matric potential as a trigger to\nturn off the irrigation.\
    \ We obtained this information from experts in the agricultural area.\n5. Results\n\
    5.1. Experiment I: Results and Discussion\nThis section presents the results of\
    \ the performance evaluation experiment concerning\nthe following metrics: false\
    \ positives, false negatives, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score,\nand data\
    \ trafﬁc. We use three scenarios as described below.\n5.1.1. Scenario A: 25 Sensor\
    \ Nodes, 5 Fog Nodes\nFrom the simulation of scenario A, we generate the confusion\
    \ matrix, presented in\nTable 4. The matrix presents the results regarding VP,\
    \ FP, FN, and VN from the comparison\nof the raw soil moisture data (generated\
    \ in the sensors) to the ﬁnal information provided\nby our fusion proposal. In\
    \ total, during the simulations performed, soil moisture sensors\ngenerate 360\
    \ readings.\nTable 4. Confusion matrix—soil moisture.\nAcceptable Moisture\nDry\

    \ from the 540 temperature data orig-\ninated in the sensor nodes. Similar to\
    \ the soil moisture data, we compared the raw\ntemperature data to the information\
    \ generated after applying the techniques. Based on the\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n\
    16 of 22\nvalues found in the confusion matrices (Tables 4 and 5), the other metrics\
    \ were calculated\nand shown in Table 6.\nTable 5. Confusion matrix—temperature.\n\

    0.994\nPrecision\n1\n1\nRecall\n1\n0.993\nF1-Score\n1\n0.993\nAccording to the\
    \ results, our CEP approach presented 100% accuracy in the soil mois-\nture data\
    \ and approximately 99% in the temperature data. Accuracy provides information\n\
    about how much the false positive inﬂuences the information generated: the percentage\n\
    of correctness when the soil has a moisture and temperature considered adequate\
    \ for the\nplant, thus preventing the plant from being without its proper irrigation\
    \ and reducing its\nproductivity. Thus, the CEP approach presented a precision\
    \ of 100% for the two observed\ndata sets. Recall informs how the false-negative\
    \ has affected the results obtained. In our\nscenario, the recall informs the\
    \ amount of correctness regarding the need to use water.\nThe approach presented\
    \ a recall above 99% for the observed data, which prevents the plant\nfrom being\
    \ unnecessarily irrigated, thus saving water. The F1-Score is a harmonic mean\n\
    that veriﬁes the disparity between precision and recall, supplying greater credibility\
    \ to\nthe observed values. This metric checks whether the accuracy or recall is\
    \ well below the\nexpected value. The CEP approach obtained an F1-score of 99%,\
    \ thus showing that in all\naspects, our CEP approach provided very coherent information\
    \ when compared to the raw\nvalues generated by the sensors.\nFigure 9 shows the\
    \ data trafﬁc with and without the Fog tier and the processing\nof complex events.\
    \ It can be seen that the trafﬁc data decreases with the complex data\nprocessing\
    \ in the Fog tier.\nFigure 9. Data trafﬁc—scenario A.\nSensors 2021, 21, 7226\n\
    17 of 22\nIn the subsequent scenarios, the scalability of the CEP approach is\
    \ checked for scenar-\nios with a higher density of nodes.\n5.1.2. Scenario B:\
    \ 50 Sensor Nodes, 10 Fog Nodes\nIn scenario B, 1800 raw data were generated,\
    \ with 900 for soil moisture and 900 for\ntemperature. The confusion matrices\
    \ presented in Tables 7 and 8 were obtained from\ncomparing the raw data with\
    \ the ﬁnal information generated using the proposed approach.\nTable 7. Confusion\

    \ 9, all parameters remain above 99% when the\nnetwork has an average density\
    \ of nodes. Thus, we can say that the CEP approach remains\nreliable when applied\
    \ to a network with average node density.\nTable 9. Evaluation metrics—scenario\

    \ Nodes\nThe experiment in scenario C veriﬁes the approach’s behavior in a network\
    \ with a\nmore signiﬁcant number of nodes. Thus, to validate the scalability of\
    \ the proposal, 3600 raw\ndata were generated: 1800 soil moisture and 1800 temperatures.\
    \ The confusion matrix\n(Table 10) was obtained by collecting the soil moisture\
    \ on the ﬁeld using the proposed\napproach. The matrix (Table 11) shows the true\
    \ and false positives and negatives of the\nmeasured temperature collected on\
    \ the ﬁeld using CEP and fusion techniques.\nTable 10. Confusion matrix—soil moisture.\n\

    \ we calculated the\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. As shown in Table\
    \ 12, all parameters remain above\n99% when the network has a high node density.\
    \ Thus, we can conclude that the approach\nremains reliable when applied to a\
    \ network with high node density.\nTable 12. Evaluation metrics—scenario C.\n\

    Observing the data trafﬁc in the simulated scenario (Figure 11), it is possible\
    \ to verify\nan average reduction of 82% when compared the use of CEP and fusion\
    \ techniques to the\nﬂow of the network without the use of the techniques.\nFigure\
    \ 11. Data trafﬁc—scenario C.\nAnother metric to be analyzed is the average time\
    \ to send a message to its ﬁnal\ndestination. By processing data obtained by the\
    \ fusion and the processing of events, some\ndata that would be initially sent\
    \ to the Cloud are treated and resolved in the previous tiers.\nOur results (Figure\
    \ 12) show that the average message sending time is 77% shorter when\nprocessing\
    \ is performed in the Fog tier without sending all data to the Cloud.\nFigure\
    \ 12. Average message sending time in the 3 scenarios.\n5.2. Experiment 2: Results\
    \ and Discussion\nFigure 13 shows the behavior of the matric potential values\
    \ during approximately\nsixty minutes of simulation. According to Figure 13, we\
    \ can conclude that the objective of\ncontrol in a simulated environment was achieved\
    \ since the value of the matric potential\nremained within the deﬁned limits.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 7226\n20 of 22\nFigure 13. Matric potential (soil moisture)\
    \ control.\nThe second part of the experiment evaluated the response time of the\
    \ irrigation\nactivation in the actuator node by identifying the event in the\
    \ CEP engine. The response\ntime of thirty events was analyzed. Figure 14 shows\
    \ the test results. The average response\ntime obtained was approximately 7.15\
    \ ms on a local network.\nFigure 14. Actuator response time.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    We presented a multi-tier hierarchical CEP approach in Fog focused on the smart\n\
    agriculture domain. Our approach is geolocation and context-aware, in which the\
    \ new\nsensor nodes in a network connect to a Fog node based on the data type\
    \ and the Euclidean\ndistance between them. To evaluate the proposal, we performed\
    \ simulations in different\nscenarios with different network densities and conﬁgurations.\
    \ The experiments achieved\npromising results, such as accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-Score which were consistently\nabove 99%. Thus, we can claim that the\
    \ information obtained using the proposed approach\nis reliable and consistent\
    \ with the reality of the monitored environment. In order to\nvalidate the effectiveness\
    \ of the CEP engine (rules and events), we conducted tests using\nan irrigation\
    \ scenario and it was successfully completed.\nOur results show that the objective\
    \ of control in a simulated environment was achieved\nsince the value of the matric\
    \ potential remains within the deﬁned limits. The second part\nof the experiment\
    \ evaluated the response time of the irrigation activation in the actuator\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 7226\n21 of 22\nnode by identifying the event in the CEP engine. The\
    \ average response time obtained was\napproximately 7.15 milliseconds on a local\
    \ network, showing that the CEP engine meets\nthe application’s needs.\nIn future\
    \ work, we intend to investigate the self-conﬁguration of the nodes regard-\n\
    ing the best characteristics to be considered for the choice of the Fog node,\
    \ such as the\nprocessing power. Another point to be explored in future work is\
    \ the use of the data stream-\noriented CEP mechanism, which is similar to SQL,\
    \ instead of rule-oriented modeling.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    to an Internet of Things (IoT) framework share the common goals of a consistent
    and structured data format that can be applied to any device, given the vast application
    scope of IoT. Additional goals include minimizing channel traffic and system energy
    consumption. In this paper, we propose to dismiss the requirement of certain seemingly
    crucial identifier fields from packets arriving through various sensor nodes in
    an agricultural IoT deployment. The proposed approach reduces packet size, thereby
    reducing channel traffic and energy consumption, as well as retaining the capability
    of identifying these originating nodes. We propose a method of a blind agricultural
    IoT node and sensor identification, which can be sourced and operated from a master
    node as well as a remote server. Additionally, this scheme has the capability
    of detecting the radio link quality between the master and slave nodes in a rudimentary
    form, as well as identifying the sensor nodes. We successfully trained and tested
    various multilayer perceptron-based models for blind identification, in real-time,
    using our implemented agricultural IoT implementation. The effect of changes in
    learning rate and momentum of the optimizer on the accuracy of classification
    is also studied. The projected cumulative energy savings across the network architecture,
    of our scheme, in conjunction with TCP/IP header compression techniques, are substantial.
    For a 100 node deployment using a combination of the proposed blind identification
    reduced sampling strategies over regular IPv4-based TCP/IP connection, an estimated
    annual saving of ≈99% is projected. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The use of Internet of Things (IoT) has
    gradually permeated all walks of life, such as monitoring various macro-aspects
    of human habitations—cities, pollution mapping, and monitoring, agriculture, irrigation
    management, health-care, power supply management, transportation, education, and
    security—as well as the micro-aspects—smart home automation, child and elderly
    care, fire detection, and vehicle monitors. The evolution of simple wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) to IoT has significantly reduced end-to-end human intervention
    in routine tasks, such as agriculture, home automation, industrial monitoring,
    and environmental monitoring. The use of low-cost wireless sensors and robust
    addressing strategies are helping in the reuse and redeployment of sensors in
    various IoT applications and scenarios [1]. Starting from narrowly focused and
    homogeneous primitive sensor-based local processing and actuation methods, present-day
    networked systems have evolved into widely dispersed, heterogeneous sensor, and
    actuator systems with remote or distributed processing. These systems are becoming
    popular due to their scalability, ease of integration, and reduced cost of implementation.
    Additionally, domains such as big-data processing and cloud computing [2], integrated
    with IoT platform and addressing schemes are enabling large-scale fusion and automated
    analysis of data [3]. A. Implementation Overview In this paper, as outlined in
    the architecture in Fig. 1, we use an ensemble of multilayer perceptron (MLP)
    [4] models on a master node as well as a remote server to automatically detect
    link errors, identify sensor nodes, and then, identify each sensor from the packets
    received from various field sensor nodes. MLP has proved to be a powerful tool
    for pattern differentiation tasks [5]. The solar-powered, field-deployed sensor
    nodes (slave nodes) transmit their data to a nearby master node by means of short-range
    wireless communication radios, which in our case are ZigBee S1 radio modules.
    The aggregated data from the master node is then transmitted to a remote server
    through the Internet by making use of long-range wireless radios from a gateway
    device, which in our deployment is a cellular network supporting GSM module. The
    remote server acts as a data storage unit as well as an analytical engine prepped
    with the trained MLP models. Subscribers/users of this system can access the raw
    data as well as visualize the data arriving at the server via the Internet. In
    the field, we focus on our system deployed for monitoring various agricultural
    field parameters—soil moisture ( S m ), soil temperature ( S st ), humidity (
    S h ), rainfall ( S r ), solar-radiation ( S sr ), ambient temperature ( S at
    ), battery voltage of each node ( S vb ), and solar voltage generated at the solar
    panel of each node ( S sv )—the architecture of which is shown in Fig. 1. Practices,
    such as precision agriculture, irrigation management, and agricultural management
    are rapidly shifting their focus on information and communication technologies.
    These modern methods rely on the use of customized sensors for weather, soil,
    water, and plant monitoring for enabling the use of agricultural IoT [6]. The
    vast domains and agricultural expanses over which a multitude of sensors are deployed
    generate huge amount of data D such that for n sensor nodes, each generating data
    d per unit time, the overall data traffic generated in the network per unit time
    is represented in the form of a tuple as D={ d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ,…, d n } . The data
    from slave nodes N i ,∀i∈(1,n) can be either from a soil parameter monitoring
    node or a weather monitoring station. Therefore, d i ,∀i∈(1,n) can be either from
    a soil sensor node or a weather station in our implementation. Further, each of
    these constituent data from individual sensor nodes d can be again represented
    as a tuple such that d soil ={ S head , S m1 , S m2 , S m3 , S m4 , S st , S bv
    , S sv , S foot } and d weather ={ S head , S h , S r , S sr , S at , S bv , S
    sv , S foot } . S head , S foot , d soil , and d weather represent the packet
    header, footer, data from soil parameter sensor node, and data from weather monitoring
    station, respectively. Data of this magnitude cannot be locally processed and
    analyzed, albeit at the cost of making these implementations costly. The use of
    low-cost sensors with reconfigurable radios, and an easily accommodating architecture
    can only be sustained and made cheaper if the processing is performed remotely
    at a master node as well as a remote server, and not on the field-deployed sensor
    nodes themselves. To further enhance the usefulness of this approach, reduction
    in operating costs and channel traffic are required for seamless operation of
    this architecture. Fig. 1. Architecture of the implemented agricultural IoT-based
    field monitoring system. Show All Assumption 1:The slave nodes N , which are placed
    at the boundary of the master node’s radio range, fail to transmit data due to
    link loss only. Assumption 2:The consolidated readings from each node ( N 1 ,
    N 2 ,… ), which consist of soil moisture, soil temperature, battery voltage, and
    solar voltage sensors, have very minute variations. These are due to variations
    in depth of the soil moisture sensor, terrain type, temperature conditions, and
    soil moisture heterogeneity [7], [8]. Fig. 1 shows the characteristics of links
    between the master and slave nodes of our deployed system. The nodes are assumed
    to be fixed and well optimized, due to the use of low power solutions such as
    ZigBee or 6LoWPAN. Without changes in the existing radio standards, modifications
    in the radio links are not an option without increasing the cost of deployment.
    Two approaches are undertaken to reduce the network data-load as outlined in Fig.
    1—master-node data compression and header compression over the TCP/IP network.
    Energy conservation within the domain of a master-node make use of schemes, such
    as compressive sensing, sink placement, and cluster-based routing [9], whereas
    energy conservation follows techniques, such as header compression [10], edge
    computing [11], fog computing, and other paradigms [12] when the data is in the
    realm of TCP/IP. Within the domain of the master node, to reduce D , the sampling
    instants of the sensor nodes themselves are changed to achieve reduced network
    data load D opt . For an original sensor sampling frequency of ω original , a
    reduced sensor sampling frequency ω reduced , and a scaling factor k , D opt (
    ω reduced )<D( ω original ) , such that ω reduced =(1/k) ω original ,∀k>1 . This
    is possible only for applications such as agriculture, as they deal with data
    which is not of temporal criticality and can be deemed as noncritical data. Delays
    in transmission of agricultural field data do not affect the purpose of deployment—monitoring
    changes in field and weather parameters, which tend to change slowly over time—as
    compared to time-critical systems such as fire monitors and health monitoring
    systems. The additional improvement is proposed in the communication link between
    the master node and the remote server. Prior to transmission to the remote server,
    the master node packetizes data in the correct order so that data from the individual
    nodes as well as sensors can be identified. A sample packet of the data from the
    master node to the server is shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, we propose a blind identification
    method using pretrained MLPs, where the master node periodically uploads data
    to the server with just the sensor data, data index, and date fields, as shown
    in Fig. 2(b). The learning algorithms in the remote server are responsible for
    identifying link errors, node identifiers, as well as sensor identifiers, from
    the incoming optimized data packets. The blind identification approach is evaluated
    at the remote server as well as the master node to reduce the unnecessary network
    transmission latency between the master node and the remote server. Fig. 2. Format
    of packets sent from slave to master nodes. (a) Original packet format. (b) Optimized
    packet format. Show All Within the purview of each master node, we intentionally
    implement sensor nodes with low-computational capability, in order to allow for
    an economical large-scale sensor-node implementation. Any approach which increases
    the computational complexity of the slave nodes, such as compressive sensing,
    and intelligent routing, automatically increases the overall cost of the field
    implementation. Hence, our proposed scheme implements slave nodes, which simply
    collect data from various locations in a field and forward it to a master node,
    which inturn removes the local packet identifiers and tags, prior to forwarding
    it over the Internet. Once the sensed data leaves the master node, header compression
    is applied on it to further reduce the network data-load of the implementation
    on the Internet. Robust header compression (ROHC) is one of the most popular techniques
    dealing with packet header compression over the Internet [10]. In lieu of our
    implementation, ROHC accentuated 3G/LTE telecommunication uplinks connecting the
    master node to the remote server is considered in addition to our proposed scheme,
    for compression of the packets gathered from the master nodes. This paper is organized
    as follows. Section II explores the state of the art in this domain. Section III
    provides the system overview and describes the dataset, followed by the details
    of the experimental setup in Section IV. Section V provides the performance analysis
    of our proposed scheme, followed by the conclusion of this paper in Section VI.
    SECTION II. Related Work The involvement of IoT with various ancillary technologies
    such as cloud, machine learning, big data, and others has resulted in rapid development
    of societally beneficial and impactful solutions boasting of a multitude of features—intelligence,
    scalability, automation, virtualization, and others. IoT platforms integrated
    with cloud-based infrastructure for load provisioning and execution of applications
    provide the additional advantages of virtualization of infrastructure as demonstrated
    by Truong and Dustdar [13]. Similar works on IoT-cloud framework for cooperation
    between cloud and smart devices was demonstrated by Kum et al. [2], whereas Nastic
    et al. [14] demonstrated the use of IoT-based software-defined units for controlling
    cloud systems. The use of reconfigurable smart sensors for IoT in industrial environments
    was demonstrated by Chi et al. [15]; whereas, Lazarescu [16] demonstrated the
    use of IoT and WSN in long-term environmental monitoring. Offloading data to a
    more powerful remote computing facility allows for processing intensive tasks
    such as automated analytics, learning, and automation, which is yet another important
    aspect of IoT [17]. Agriculture is a domain which is actively transitioning toward
    the use of IoT and machine learning for monitoring, analysis, prediction, and
    automation in tasks, which was previously manual and intuition-based. Transcending
    from traditional implementations of IoT, Kaloxylos et al. [6] described the implementation
    of an IoT-cloud-based precision farming system, achieving an Agri-IoT-cloud-based
    framework. More recently, IoT-based agricultural solution pilots are deployed
    across multiple countries in order to usher in food-security, reduce wastage of
    food, and scientifically optimize agricultural practices [18]. Similarly, IoT
    platforms are developed for precision agriculture as well as ecological monitoring
    [19]. The surging plethora of data types, architectures, and applications associated
    with IoT face the bottleneck of network bandwidth, which for most cases is established
    using legacy technologies, such as IPv4 over TCP or UDP. Various approaches for
    optimizing network bandwidth usage of in-place network infrastructure are proposed
    over the years. Approaches ranging from reduction of transmitted packet size [10]
    and judicious use of edge devices [20] to edge mining [11] have reported various
    degrees of successes in network bandwidth optimization. Header compression solutions
    such as ROHC [10], ROHCv2 [21], and others [12] build upon the fact that headers
    are static/constant in an IP stream. Synthesis: Solutions addressing the problem
    of payload minimization of the gathered data from the local networks connected
    to an IoT infrastructure is lacking, especially in agricultural scenarios. As,
    the bulk of the nodes and sensors deployed in these scenarios are resource and
    energy constrained, strategies must be devised to minimize their energy consumption
    in the long run. Additionally, these nodes are expected to house multiple heterogeneous
    sensors, which increases the payload size generated from each of these nodes.
    The payload, being uploaded to the cloud through the Internet reaches gargantuan
    proportions, in cases of large IoT deployment with frequent data sampling. SECTION
    III. System Overview The architecture of our implemented agricultural IoT is divided
    into four parts: 1) slave nodes; 2) master node; 3) IoT framework; and 4) the
    remote stochastic learning (RSL) module. The architecture of this implementation
    is shown in Fig. 1. Each slave node N i hosts ATmega328P processor with a processing
    speed of 16 MHz, and is equipped with four soil moisture sensors S m1 to S m4
    , placed at depths of 15 cm, 30 cm, 45 cm, and 60 cm. Additionally, the slave
    nodes are equipped with a soil temperature sensor, battery voltage detector, and
    solar voltage detector circuitry which is connected to the battery and a solar
    panel. The radio used is a ZigBee module, which is configured to work in a mesh
    network. The customized mini-processor in the slave node also control relays,
    which may be connected to pumps for automatic irrigation by triggering them from
    the remote server. Some of the deployed slave nodes in our implementation are
    shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Our implemented agricultural IoT slave nodes. (a) Weather
    station, (b) soil sensor node, and (c) weather station. Show All The master node
    communicates to the slave nodes via ZigBee radio links. The master node hosts
    a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 (ARMv8), with a processing speed of 1.2 GHz. It also
    acts as the local gateway for its networked slave nodes, providing them with locally
    identifiable addresses within its operational domain. The communications from
    and to the remote server to the slave nodes are redirected through this gateway,
    which also happens to be the master node for this IoT framework. Multiple such
    gateways can be easily incorporated into the IoT framework to send their data
    to the remote server via the Internet. Our implemented server runs a Windows 8
    operating system with an Intel i3 processor, and clock speed of 3.72 GHz. The
    RSL module is hosted on the remote server. The data from all nodes D opt in the
    field are continually uploaded to the remote server by means of Web-sockets through
    the gateway. The pretrained models (Algorithm 1) in the server are used for classifying
    the incoming data. The data, after being sorted by the RSL module are analyzed
    for determining the field stress conditions and water requirements of crops. The
    actuators controlling the irrigation pumps can be accordingly activated from the
    server based on the soil parameter threshold conditions programmed in the server
    module. The whole field-side, slave node placement is divided into two parts based
    on the radio range R of the slave nodes from the master node—normal range and
    boundary range. The nodes in the boundary range tend to lose connection to the
    master node occasionally due to bad weather conditions and other unavoidable circumstances.
    Algorithm 1 RSL Show All procedure CREATE MODEL Q Show All procedure CREATE MODEL
    N Show All procedure CREATE MODEL S Show All A. Data The data obtained from various
    sensors affixed to a slave node d i is sent to the master node, from where it
    is uploaded to a remote server via the Internet using the IoT platform. Initially,
    the packets are uploaded in the format given in Fig. 2(a). Each slave sends d
    i =14 bytes of data per second. The data logging interval ω can be increased or
    decreased on-demand by means of text messages from its registered users/owners,
    which changes the values of the scaling factor k accordingly. We, additionally,
    reduce some of the fields from the data packets, and henceforth, refer to it as
    the optimized packet [Fig. 2(b)]. The reduction of 4 bytes of data per slave,
    per second, is a significant reduction in data volume, in case of long-term monitoring
    using large-scale sensor networks. Specific to our implementation, nodes 1 and
    3 are placed in the boundary zone, as depicted in Fig. 1. They have a high probability
    of link errors (Assumption 1). Nodes 2 and 4 are in the normal range of the master
    node and suffer from relatively, minuscule errors due to link failure. Subsequently,
    even after reducing the packet size, we can further reduce the data load to the
    server by reducing the data polling interval to twice per hour. As the sensors,
    in this case, are used for noncritical data measurement and the soil parameters
    tend to change slowly over time, this drastic reduction in data sampling does
    not significantly affect the overall decision-making process. This strategy would
    have been unthinkable in case of critical data, such as those obtained from health-care,
    traffic [22], or disaster management implementations of IoT. However, we find
    that the packet size reduction works fine with all applications of this framework.
    Assumption 3:The individual sensors in a sensor node have negligible fingerprints,
    even if they are of the same type. This may be due to insufficient hardware calibration
    [23] or even due to atomic level irregularities induced at the time of device
    fabrication. Assumption 4:The soil moisture sensors depend on the variation in
    dielectric constants between air, soil, and water to measure soil moisture content.
    This varies slightly due to varying electromagnetic interference (EMI) at various
    locations. Proof:The changes in dielectric properties of a substance, due to the
    introduction of an electromagnetic field, depends on the polarization effect of
    molecules. For a relative dielectric permittivity of E , the variation of E with
    frequency ω as described by Romano et al. [24] is given as E(ω)= E ′ (ω)−j[ E
    ′′ (ω)+ σ DC ω E 0 ] (1) View Source where: AbbreviationExpansion E ′ (ω) real
    component and signifies the energy stored in the system due to alignment of dipoles
    and EMI; E ′′ (ω) imaginary component and accounts for the dissipation of energy;
    σ DC signifies DC electrical conductivity and depends on actual transport of charge
    carriers; ω angular frequency of the imposed electromagnetic field. Changes in
    E ′ (ω) due to unnecessary EM interference or soil properties give rise to variations
    in sensor readings from the same type of soil moisture sensors. However, these
    changes are very small [24], and are neglected from consideration in this paper.
    SECTION IV. Experimental Setup This section discusses the experimental setup used
    in this paper. This covers the methodology used, remote server-based learning,
    and the computation of the carbon footprint for the implementation. Four assumptions
    are taken into account while applying the methodologies on the discussed architecture
    and learning modules in the server, as given by Assumptions 1–4. A. Overview of
    the Experiments As discussed in Section III, the placement of nodes is mainly
    divided into two groups: 1) normal range and 2) boundary range. We classify the
    unlabeled data arriving at the server and fit against the models generated using
    historical data from both normal and boundary range slave nodes. The method of
    classifying the data is outlined in Algorithm 1. On the training dataset, we first
    choose the ideal learning rate and momentum values (described in the next section)
    of the MLP-based classifier. Upon finally arriving at an optimum value, which
    can be used for the three cases—link error detection, node identification, and
    sensor identification—we demonstrate the accuracy of detection and loss minimization
    by a mean squared loss estimator (MSE), for our method. As a typical master node
    is resource constrained in terms of computation power, we modify the MLP architecture
    at the remote server to make its execution feasible on the master node. We term
    the original MLP model at the remote server as the Heavy model and the modified
    one on the master node as the Light model. Finally, we calculate the carbon footprint
    of our approach against the previous unoptimized approach. The carbon footprint
    of a system is calculated in terms of emission of CO2 released in the atmosphere
    in order to generate the power consumed by the system. The emission factor for
    an electric system is 6.89551× 10 −4 metric tons of CO2/kWh, as per e-GRID of
    the United States Environment Protection Agency, from the year 2010 data. In other
    words, consumption of 1 kWh of electricity releases 0.16 kg of CO2 in the atmosphere.
    This quantity may seem insignificant, but it tends to build up in cases of large
    sensor network deployments, running over prolonged periods of time. B. Methodology
    The data from Normal range nodes are grouped in a class and the Boundary range
    nodes are grouped into another class for training the MLP-based classifier. Our
    approach of dropping node and sensor identifiers from the packets makes it necessary
    to have an identification process in place which will categorize the uploaded
    data accordingly. Algorithm 1 identifies link errors as well as categorizes the
    incoming data into the various node and sensor classes according to their fingerprints.
    Although the sensors may be the same in all nodes, they do have minute variations
    of their own due to insufficient sensor and hardware calibration, a mismatch in
    placement depth [23], varying land topology and heterogeneity in soil moisture
    profiles [7], [8]. Similarly, the individual sensors are also differentiated from
    each other due to the inherent presence of minute calibration mismatch, fabrication
    irregularities and nonlinearity; this irregularity proves beneficial for our individual
    sensor identification. Fig. 4 shows the overall collective scheme of using the
    three trained models—Model Q, Model N, and Model S—in detecting link errors, identifying
    sensor nodes, and then identifying the individual sensors in each node. Fig. 4.
    Dataflow representation of the server-side packet restructuring module or the
    RSL module. Show All C. Remote Learning The following three modules—Model Q, Model
    N, and Model S—comprise the RSL algorithm in the server. The working of these
    modules is shown in Fig. 4. These models are trained based on the previously collected
    data. New data from the sensor nodes coming into the server are classified based
    on these pretrained models. The ensemble of these three models is used for blind
    identification of packets and its features from a restructured and reduced packet,
    arriving at the remote server. 1) Optimizer Selection: The optimizer selection
    ensures precise and speedy decision making for any machine learning-based algorithm.
    A stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [25] approach over back-propagation is chosen
    due to its high variance, low running cost, low-memory requirements, and ability
    to handle large data sizes over the entire training set. SGD operates by updating
    an objective J(θ) , where θ is one of its parameters, as θ:=θ−α ∇ θ E[J(θ)] (2)
    View Source where E[J(θ)] is the expectation of the objective and is calculated
    over the entire training set. However, in an SGD update, the expectation term
    is eliminated and is represented as θ:=θ−α ∇ θ J(θ; x (i) , y (i) ) . The values
    of ( x (i) , y (i) ) are obtained from the ith iteration of the training set.
    The objective updates are calculated based on small training data. 2) Activation
    Function Selection: A proper activation function selection is critical to our
    operation as it defines the distribution of the data to pass. For our approach,
    a regularized linear unit (ReLU) [26] is used as the activation function, instead
    of the traditional Sigmoid function, as the output of the Sigmoid function lies
    in the range [0, 1] and tends to saturate beyond this. The ReLU, on the other
    hand, has a range of [0,∞] and can be used for modeling real numbers, instead
    of just probability (as is done by Sigmoid functions). A Sigmoid function is represented
    as σ(x)=(1+ e −x ) −1 . In contrast to the Sigmoid function, the ReLU function
    is denoted as f(x)= Σ ∞ i=1 σ(x−i+0.5) . f(x) is similar to f(x)=log(1+ e x )
    , which is also referred to as a Softplus function and is approximated as f(x)=log(1+
    e x )≈max(0,x+N(0,1)). (3) View Source This is often referred to as rectified
    linear function (ReL). The gradient of the ReL function does not vanish, unlike
    the Sigmoid-based activation functions. 3) Learning: The data is generally shuffled
    prior to training in order to avoid biasing due to unforeseen, repetitive patterns
    in the dataset. Another function, the momentum ( γ ), is used to speed up the
    convergence of the objective. The update of momentum is given by v= θ= γv+α ∇
    θ J(θ; x (i) , y (i) )∀size(v)=size(θ) θ−v (4) (5) View Source where v is the
    current velocity and γ∈(0,1] . Section V shows the learning rate ( α ) and momentum
    value ( γ ) selection for the given agricultural sensor dataset. It also demonstrates
    the superiority of the ReLU-based activation over Sigmoid-based functions in SGD
    implementation of our system. D. Calculating the Carbon Footprint The carbon footprint
    of the architecture and our proposed improvement is calculated as S S−M = S S−M
    = S payload−14 + S ZigBee−API bytes S payload−14 +24bytes (6) (7) View Source
    where S S−M is the size of data received at the master node from the slave, S
    payload−14 is the data collected from the sensors and other parameters of the
    slave node using the original packet format ( ≃14 bytes, in this case), as shown
    in Fig. 2(a). S ZigBee-API is the ZigBee API’s frame format, which is fixed at
    24 bytes [27]. Again, it takes P 1-bit =184.9μW /bit to transmit 1 bit of data;
    ZigBee takes 1 s to transmit 24 bytes of data [27]. As we focus only on reducing
    the payload of the ZigBee data, from the slave to the master node. Henceforth,
    we shall consider only the payload part for our carbon footprint computation.
    Moreover, the slave and master nodes run on solar power and can be safely considered
    as zero-carbon footprint devices. The part of the architecture, starting from
    the gateway to the remote server (as shown in Fig. 1) have high energy requirements
    and rely on traditional and mostly nonrenewable energy sources. However, the use
    of approaches such as ROHC-based header compression significantly reduces the
    energy consumption of this part of the network architecture. The remaining part
    of the architecture consisting of sensor nodes is dependent on solar energy for
    regular operation and does not generate a carbon-footprint. Hence, only the path
    from gateway to the remote server is considered for carbon footprint computation
    of our approach. Since the master node discards the ZigBee-API frames, we represent
    the effective packet size sent to the remote server as S U = S payload−14 , where
    S U is the unoptimized packet size. Furthermore, S O and S OR are assigned to
    indicate optimized packet size and optimized packet size with reduced sampling,
    respectively. For S payload−10 and S payload−10−r denoting the reduced payload
    and the reduced payload with reduced data sampling, we assign, S O = S payload−10
    and S OR = S payload−10−r . Subsequently, for P (kWh) signifying the power consumed
    (in kW ) for transmitting S payload bytes of data per hour, and C P denoting the
    carbon footprint in kg-CO2 released into the atmosphere, we denote P(kWh)=185.9×
    10 −6 × S payload ×3.6 and calculate C P =P(kWh)×0.16  Kg-CO 2 . SECTION V. Performance
    Analysis This section discusses the output obtained from the experimental setup.
    The MLP is trained over the dataset, for both Sigmoid and ReLU activations. The
    learning rate ( α ) and momentum ( γ ) are varied to check the accuracy of classification
    for all three RSL modules— Model Q , Model N , and Model S —for determining the
    optimum MLP parameters. To sum-up the MLP results. Fig. 5(a) and (d) shows the
    performance of the Sigmoid and ReLU-based activation functions in determining
    link errors. The ReLU-based parameters, with α=[0.01,0.001] and 0.7≥γ≤0.9 , consistently
    perform better than all other cases. Fig. 5(b) and (e) shows that ReLU with α=[0.1,0.01]
    and 0.8≥γ≤0.9 , show superior performance over Sigmoid activation for classifying
    various nodes, from the incoming dataset. Fig. 5(c) and (f) shows the performance
    of the MLP in classifying the various sensors in a node. Here, ReLU activation
    for α=0.1 and 0.7≥γ≤0.9 give the best performance, for classifying individual
    sensors, from the incoming data. The optimum hyper-parameters, determined for
    the training of the three heavy RSL modules at the remote server— Model Q , Model
    N , and Model S —are evaluated using an ReLU activation, SGD optimizer, MSE loss
    function with α=0.01 and γ=0.9 for the Decay, Epoch, and Batch-size of the MLP
    set to 1× 10 −6 , 50, and 16, respectively. The model specific MLP parameters
    for the three models are 2 inputs, 2 outputs, and 2 hidden layers with 64,128
    neurons each for Model Q , 7 inputs, 4 outputs, and 2 hidden layers with 128,128
    neurons each for Model N , and 4 inputs, 5 outputs, and 64,128 neurons in 2 hidden
    layers for Model S , respectively. The corresponding accuracy of classification,
    achieved by using these parameters are 96% for Model Q , 92.5% for Model N , and
    95.6% for Model S units of the RSL module at the remote server. Fig. 6(a) and
    (b) shows the changes in accuracy and the minimization of loss (using MSE) for
    the RSL modules during training of the dataset. The dataset was trained over 50
    epochs, as beyond this the learning curve saturates and no further improvement
    in learning is achieved. Fig. 5. Effect of γ and α variations on the accuracy
    of classification for the RSL algorithms for the heavy model at the remote server.

    accuracy and loss of the trained models for node identification, sensor identification,
    and link quality detection for the heavy model at the remote server. (a) Change
    in accuracy. (b) Change in loss. Show All Fig. 7(a) shows the carbon footprint
    of the agricultural deployment for five selected approaches, viz.—(G1) unoptimized
    packet over TCP/IP, (G2) optimized packet over TCP/IP, (G3) optimized packet with
    reduced sampling (sampled every alternate second) over TCP/IP, (G4) optimized
    packet with reduced sampling (sampled every fourth second) over TCP/IP, and (G5)
    unoptimized packet over ROHC TCP/IP—calculated with respect to varying nodes for
    a year. For a 100 node deployment, it is estimated that, as compared to the proposed
    scheme, the use of ROHC instead of compressionless TCP/IP achieves an overall
    reduction in carbon footprint by 50% for the same datasize as shown in Fig. 7(a)
    G1 and G5. Additionally, comparison between approaches G1 with G2, G3, and G4
    shows that our proposed scheme achieves savings of over 99% CO2 generated annually
    over regular IPv4 TCP/IP transmission. Again, comparing G1 with G5 (ROHC with
    comparable dataload), we observe that ROHC manages to attain further savings of
    50% of the CO2 generated annually for the same datasizes. It is to be noted that
    header compression schemes such as ROHC do not affect the payload size of the
    transmitted data. Additionally, as both uncompressed IPv4 packets over TCP/IP
    and ROHC work beyond the purview of the master node, massive savings in generated
    data within the master node’s domain affects the carbon footprint beyond its operational
    boundaries by dictating the payload size. Our proposed scheme manages to massively
    reduce the payload size of the data to be transmitted over the network to the
    remote server. The additional use of compression methods such as ROHC, which is
    primarily a header compression scheme, further helps in the reduction of carbon
    footprint [as shown in the inset plot in Fig. 7(a)] in domains such as agriculture,
    where the need for real-time data is not necessary. Fig. 7. Carbon footprint of
    the agricultural deployment with 100 nodes, projected for all the 5 approaches
    for a year, and comparison between master-node and remote server-based learning
    approaches within the same implementation. (a) Carbon footprint for 100 nodes
    over a year. (b) Metrics for learning at the master node versus at the remote
    server. Show All It is to be noted that having the learning models integrated
    directly with the master node would reduce the network load, and the latency caused
    thereof. However, we found that the latencies produced due to the operation of
    MLP models hosted at master node [as shown in Fig. 7(b)], were much higher than
    the 1 min mark, rendering them useless for operation in a real-time manner. These
    models and their parameters are similar in all respects to the ones hosted at
    the remote server, which we label as Heavy Model in Fig. 7(b). Upon modifying
    the MLP model architectures to make them extremely lightweight for faster service
    at the master nodes [light model in Fig. 7(b), which has 2 hidden layers each
    with 5,5 neurons], albeit at the cost of detection accuracies, we found that the
    latencies were almost double of the ones incurred at the server. Additionally,
    it is worthwhile to mention that the detection accuracies of the three trained
    models fell below 70% in case of Model N and Model S , whereas it fell below 30%
    for Model Q . In summary, Fig. 7(b) highlights the importance and need of remote
    learning at the server in comparison to learning at the master nodes for the same
    MLP architectures. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper proposes an optimized method
    for detecting simple link failures between slave and master nodes. Additionally,
    the method for identifying slave nodes from data packets, even in the absence
    of node identifiers in the payload packet and identifying individual sensors in
    a node, in the absence of sensor identifier in the payload packet has also been
    designed and tested. This approach is tested on a remote server as well as a constrained
    master node, much nearer to the implementation site. Outsourcing the error detection
    and other identification tasks, which are computation intensive, to a remote server,
    allows the use of low-cost, low-specification and low-energy processors for IoT
    deployment. This method of minimizing packet size of traffic between slave to
    master node and to the remote server, via the Internet results in substantial
    reduction of network traffic, reduction of data, and conservation of node energy.
    The choice of hosting the proposed scheme at a master node severely hampers the
    performance of the scheme by increasing the on-node execution time. Even implementing
    lighter MLP models incur higher execution time at a master node. We conclude that
    the benefits of hosting these MLP models at the remote server far outweigh the
    benefits of minor savings in network bandwidth offered by hosting these models
    at the master node. In the future, we plan to implement unsupervised learning
    methods and other online learning methods to accommodate for heterogeneous data
    from sensor networks of similar or different types. Authors Figures References

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    2 Related work

    In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system not aﬀected by communication disconnection
    and delay is developed

    using edge nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate
    impact on the plant

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    639

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Pi that acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the
    actuators. For example,

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    from sensors and the second one is for controlling the actuators in the ﬁeld.
    Depending on the sensor type

    with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling

    Arduino uno joins with actuators in the ﬁeld and controls (turn on/oﬀ) them in
    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

  analysis: '**Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use:**


    Numerous data sources and types are involved in automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management. Among them are soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature
    sensors, weather stations, and flow meters. Soil moisture sensors measure the
    water content of the soil and provide real-time data on the water status of the
    crops. Canopy temperature sensors measure the temperature of the plant canopy,
    which is an indicator of plant water stress. Weather stations provide data on
    temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, which are all factors
    that influence plant water use. Flow meters measure the amount of water applied
    to the crop, which is necessary for calculating water use efficiency.


    **Current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation
    management systems:**


    Real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential
    to significantly improve water use efficiency and crop yields. By using real-time
    data to make informed decisions about irrigation scheduling, these systems can
    help farmers to avoid overwatering and underwatering, which can both lead to reduced
    yields. Additionally, automated systems can help to reduce labor costs and improve
    the overall efficiency of irrigation operations.


    **Examining automation across the entire pipeline: from data collection and transmission
    to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action:**


    The automation of irrigation management systems involves a number of different
    steps, including data collection and transmission, data processing and analysis,
    decision-making, and automated action. Data collection and transmission involve
    the use of sensors to collect data on soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather,
    and flow rates. Data processing and analysis involve the use of algorithms to
    convert the raw data into actionable information. Decision-making involves the
    use of decision-support tools to determine the optimal irrigation schedule. Automated
    action involves the use of actuators to implement the irrigation schedule.


    **Highlighting the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the
    integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline:**


    Interoperability and standardization are essential to enabling the integration
    of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Interoperability
    refers to the ability of different components to communicate with each other and
    exchange data. Standardization refers to the use of common protocols and data
    formats. By ensuring interoperability and standardization, it is possible to create
    automated irrigation management systems that are scalable, extensible, and easy
    to maintain.


    **Identifying challenges and proposing solutions for fully autonomous, scalable
    irrigation management:**


    There are a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve
    fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. One challenge is the need for
    robust and reliable data collection and transmission. Another challenge is the
    need for accurate and timely data processing and analysis. A third challenge is
    the need for effective decision-making algorithms. A fourth challenge is the need
    for reliable and efficient automated action. By addressing these challenges, it
    is possible to develop automated irrigation management systems that can help farmers
    to improve water use efficiency and crop yields.'

    \ municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality\n\
    of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating\
    \ expenses. This model\nincorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom).\
    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\
    \ the essential harmonization and control of the many\nsystem mechanisms to achieve\
    \ these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics\nof smart\
    \ city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking\
    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n2 of 63\nfor computation and IoT data storage [5].\
    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\
    summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly,\
    \ Section 8\nconcludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.\n\

    \ were not related to\nour concerned ﬁeld were also crossed out. After eliminating\
    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\
    \ such as threat observations,\ndecision making, communication, and actions. However,\
    \ the software cannot handle\nhigh levels of incorporation across all the relevant\
    \ devices and guarantee real-time and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n5 of 63\ntrustworthy\
    \ replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].\n\
    They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment\n\
    to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and\
    \ intelligent\nsoftware that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.\
    \ Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,\nwhich incorporate device monitoring across\
    \ numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc\npatterns, are another application\
    \ of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present\nan example of intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc lights.\nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to\
    \ increase their intelli-\ngence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability.\
    \ CPS systems are integrated into water\nnetworks to add smart characteristics\
    \ to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering\nearly warning systems\
    \ to identify problems in water networks is one of these duties. For\ninstance,\
    \ it is simple to identify leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary ﬁxes can be\n\
    implemented to prevent water wastage and future network threats or damage [20].\n\
    WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides\n\
    well-organized control for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level\
    \ in green-\nhouses [21]. Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry\
    \ to automate, control,\nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23].\
    \ Finally, smart-healthcare systems\nbased on edge computing [24] are proposed\
    \ to monitor and examine the physical health of\nusers [25].\nFigure 2 shows some\
    \ important applications including smart trafﬁc surveillance\nand management,\
    \ smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste\nmanagement,\
    \ smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart home.\n \n\
    observations, decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software\
    \ \ncannot handle high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices\
    \ and guarantee \nreal-time and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving\
    \ vehicles are regarded as \ncrucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned\
    \ capabilities with vision and \nmonitoring equipment to provide the vehicle the\
    \ ability to traverse the roads using \nsensed data and intelligent software that\
    \ evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. \nIntelligent traffic light\
    \ controls, which incorporate device monitoring across numerous \nlocations to\
    \ precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application of intelligent\
    \ \ntransportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent traffic\
    \ lights. \nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase\
    \ their intel-\nligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems\
    \ are integrated into \nwater networks to add smart characteristics to the processes\
    \ of water distribution [19]. \nOffering early warning systems to identify problems\
    \ in water networks is one of these \nduties. For instance, it is simple to identify\
    \ leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes \ncan be implemented to prevent\
    \ water wastage and future network threats or damage \n[20]. \nWSN-based monitoring\
    \ of greenhouses is another SCA. Such monitoring provides \nwell-organized control\
    \ for appropriate soil, climate, lighting, and water level in green-\nhouses [21].\
    \ Other smart city systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control,\
    \ \nmonitor, and improve manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare\
    \ sys-\ntems based on edge computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine\
    \ the physical \nhealth of users [25]. \nFigure 2 shows some important applications\
    \ including smart traffic surveillance and \nmanagement, smart healthcare, weather\
    \ and air quality monitoring, smart waste man-\nagement, smart street lighting,\
    \ smart emergency response system, and smart home. \n \nFigure 2. Facilitating\
    \ networking and communication amongst SCAs.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n6 of\
    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\
    \ bandwidth and latency tolerance.\nIn each SCA, the number of devices involved\
    \ differs.\nTable 1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements.\n\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    \ battery devices [83].\nNew connectivity solutions are being investigated in\
    \ light of the following question:\ndo the currently available methods, tools,\
    \ and techniques—especially those for wireless\nnetworks—allow for the reliable\
    \ handling of such a large number of smart devices?\nYaqoob et al. [84] provided\
    \ details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN\ntechnologies such as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-\nmunication.\
    \ In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-\nnected\
    \ devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies\n\
    (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only\n\
    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\
    \ to\ntarget smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering\
    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\

    \ to 5G. 5G\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n19 of 63\nultimately targets some networking\
    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\
    \ of trafﬁc\nprioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.\nQoS improvements\n\

    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n28 of 63\n4.5. Challenges in IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP\
    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\
    \ valuable\ninformation that various applications use at the application layer\
    \ to provide services.\nThe majority of the above works mainly focus on a single\
    \ characteristic, such as quality\nof service [162].\nMarques et al. [163] proposed\
    \ a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure\nmanagement architecture\
    \ that allows the integration of physical objects, communication\ninfrastructure,\

    \ (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sensor data\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    35 of 63\nare processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing\
    \ unit\nresponsible for gathering information used by the application providing\
    \ a service.\nThe local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as\
    \ it pushes part of the\ncomputation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating\
    \ all the computation in\na centralized remote server.\n2.\nThe Communication\
    \ Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access\ntechnologies.\
    \ The communication layer supports the implementation of various\nwireless technologies.\
    \ The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer\ndeﬁnes the\
    \ technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using\nthe\
    \ interface of a network access point.\n3.\nThe Cloud Platform Layer provides\
    \ three services: processing, database queries, and\ndata storage. In the context\
    \ of providing services for smart cities, each of these services\ncan be dynamically\
    \ allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,\nonly some\
    \ applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.\n\
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation\n\
    is optional.\n4.\nThe Services Layer implements four groups, which are called\
    \ classes of services:\n(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III)\
    \ Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-\nnology. In each class, different kinds of applications\
    \ can be implemented to deal with\nthe challenges of smart cities.\nThis architecture\
    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\
    \ SBA that is integrated with the repre-\nsentational state transfer (RESTful)\
    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\
    \ along with that of the\nexternal surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air\
    \ Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).\nThe basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are\
    \ a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal\nconditioning circuit, a\
    \ small amount of external memory, and a communication module\nthat is typically\
    \ wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can\n\
    detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and\
    \ O3, as\nwell as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and\
    \ temperature. These\nsensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values\
    \ of the real-time indoor air quality\nparameters and an external memory used\
    \ to store real-time data [214]. When deploying\nsuch systems, various communication\
    \ (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and\nLoRAWAN technologies, are considered.\n\

    \ IoT and BI stakeholders\nmust make a concerted effort to give modern BI access\
    \ to a generic IoT framework with\ncognitive intelligence and context-aware computing\
    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\
    \ to 6U,\nand U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.\n•\nUAVs/satellite communication.\n\
    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

    Ubiquitous technology, big data, more eﬃcient electronic health records, and predictive
    analytics are now at the core of smart

    healthcare systems supported by artiﬁcial intelligence. In the present narrative
    review, we focus on sensing technologies for

    the healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). We employed a framework inspired by the
    Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory

    (IPNB), which posits that human experience is characterized by a ﬂow of energy
    and information both within us (within

    our whole body), and between us (in the connections we have with others and with
    nature). In line with this framework,

    we focused on sensors designed to evaluate bodily processes (body sensors such
    as implantable sensors, epidermal sensors,

    and wearable and portable sensors), human social interaction (sociometric sensors),
    and the physical environment (indoor

    and outdoor ambient sensors). There is a myriad of man-made sensors as well as
    nature-based sensors such as plants that

    can be used to design and deploy intelligent systems for human monitoring and
    healthcare. In conclusion, sensing

    technologies and intelligent systems can be employed for smarter healthcare of
    AN and help to relieve the burden of

    health professionals. However, there are technical, ethical, and environmental
    sustainability issues that must be considered

    prior to implementing these systems. A joint collaboration of professionals and
    other members of the society involved in

    the healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the development of these systems.
    The evolution of cyberphysical

    systems should also be considered in these collaborations.

    1. Introduction

    Ubiquitous technology, big data, more eﬃcient electronic

    health records, and predictive analytics are now at the core

    of smart healthcare systems supported byartiﬁcial intelligence

    (AI) [1]. Particularly, the advances in health informatics and

    sensor technology provide several possibilities for a positive

    transformation of traditional medical treatments. For exam-

    ple, intelligent systems can provide real-time feedback to elec-

    tronic devices, the patient, and the physician to improve the

    eﬃciency in healthcare, reduce costs, relieve the burden of

    health professionals, and more importantly, to enhance

    human decision making, allowing better and more informed

    medical decisions for an optimal treatment [2]. In the present

    narrative review, we focus on sensing technologies for the

    healthcare of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Although AN is among

    the least common mental disorders, AN aﬀects approximately

    13.6 million people [95% UI: 10.2–17.5 million], mostly

    women, and accounts for the most deaths among eating disor-

    ders [3–5]. Moreover, the illness course in AN is usually a pro-

    tracted course that can develop into a severe-enduring

    condition with detrimental eﬀects in the health of millions of

    women [6, 7].

    Instead of a deep dive into the technical aspects of sensor

    technology, which is not our area of competence, we provide

    an overview of sensing technologies for researchers and

    Hindawi

    health professionals in the ﬁeld of eating disorders. Those

    interested to further explore this technology can use the

    extensive list of bibliographic references used to elaborate

    this manuscript.

    This study is divided into two major sections. In the ﬁrst

    section, we introduce sensor technology and the framework

    we will use to group the large diversity of sensors. This ﬁrst

    section covers body sensors (implantable, epidermal, wear-

    able, and portable), sociometric sensors, and ambient sen-

    sors.

    The

    second

    section

    is

    dedicated

    to

    the

    implementation

    of

    intelligent

    systems

    for

    smarter

    healthcare.

    1.1. Sensor Technology. In general terms, sensors capture and

    quantify physical phenomena such as temperature [8, 9].

    There is a myriad of sensors for various ﬁelds such as aero-

    space

    technology,

    agriculture,

    food

    packaging,

    and

    healthcare, among many others. For example, conventional

    electrochemical biosensors can detect bioﬂuids in the human

    body like lactate [10]. More advanced biosensors, based on

    quantum mechanics and nanomaterials (e.g., polymer, gra-

    phene, carbon), can detect neurotransmitters like dopamine

    or serotonin [11–17]. For example, quantum sensors can be

    used to detect photons or electromagnetic ﬁelds at the

    atomic level, allowing the detection of neural activity [9].

    Therefore, to explore the applications of sensors for the

    healthcare of AN, we employed a framework inspired by

    Interpersonal Neurobiology Theory (IPNB) [18]. IPNB

    posits that human experience is characterized by a ﬂow of

    energy and information both within us (within our whole

    body), and between us (in the connections we have with

    others and with nature) [18]. In this regard, what we call

    mind, would be “the emergent, self-organizing, embodied,

    and relational process that regulates the ﬂow of energy and

    information” [18(p. 4)]. In line with this framework, we focus

    on sensors designed to evaluate bodily processes (body sen-

    sors), human social interaction (sociometrics), and the phys-

    ical environment.

    1.1.1. Body Sensors. Body sensors can be further divided into

    diﬀerent categories. In this review, we categorize them as

    implantable (injectable, insertable, or ingestible), epidermal

    (skin-attached), and wearable and portable [19].

    (1) Implantable Sensors. The cardiac pacemaker developed

    in the 1960s is an illustrative example of one of the ﬁrst

    implantable sensors [19]. Novel heart monitoring devices

    include Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry (MCOT; Car-

    dioNet, Inc.), Reveal LINQ (Medtronic), and Implantable

    Cardioverter Deﬁbrillators (ICDs) such as Visia AF devices

    (Medtronic) for the management of tachyarrhythmia. Car-

    diovascular issues in AN are widely recognized and “are

    the main cause of morbidity and mortality in AN” [20].

    Studies report elevated heart rate variability (HRV), brady-

    cardia, and QT interval prolongation (that is, from the Q

    wave to the end of the T wave in an electrocardiogram),

    the latter two associated with the development of ventricular

    arrhythmias [20, 21].

    In this regard, a recent study reported a sensor capable of

    providing interoceptive stimulation to enhance HRV [22].

    Interoception deﬁcits (i.e., the diﬃculty to accurately iden-

    tify internal physiological signals like hunger or satiety),

    have been identiﬁed as a key symptom in network analysis

    of AN psychopathology [23]. Therefore, there is a venue

    for further research on the autonomic nervous system in

    AN [24] using sensing technology.

    Implantable sensors can also be used for neural sensing

    (e.g., brain neural recording), intracranial neurostimulation

    (invasive deep brain stimulation, DBS), neuromodulation,

    and neurofeedback [25–36]. The neuroanatomical areas of

    major interest for the treatment of AN have been the brain’s

    subcallosal cingulate cortex and the nucleus accumbens

    [36–40]. Other reports include the dorsolateral prefrontal

    cortex (DLPFC) [26], the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis

    [41], and the ventral anterior limb of the capsula interna

    [42]. Most of these studies have focused on eating behavior

    and weight gain as indicators of successful outcomes [43],

    and much less on body image issues [e.g., 40]. First, it is

    important to recognize that weight gain is just one of many

    other important markers of a successful treatment outcome

    [33]. Second, it is also worth noting the caveats of imple-

    menting intracranial sensors (e.g., undergoing neurosurgery,

    using durable and ﬂexible biocompatible materials, cytotox-

    icity) [34], and most importantly the ethical concerns that

    can generate these interventions [44, 45].

    Implantable brain sensing technologies have raised

    many

    interests

    among

    scholars,

    health

    professionals,

    patients, business companies, and the public through the

    media depiction of brain-computer interfaces [46]. How-

    ever, it has raised concerns about ethical issues related to

    the use and misuse of neurotechnologies [44, 47–55]. In this

    regard, it is important to consider both ethical issues and

    future directions, prior to adopting implantable neural

    devices and neurostimulation [56–58].

    Other than heart and brain sensors, there are also

    implantable biosensors for tracking diverse biochemical sub-

    stances and processes in the human body. There are several

    chemical substances of interest (biomarkers) for the treat-

    ment of AN. For example, individuals with AN commonly

    present an endocrine dysregulation associated with the

    hypothalamic-pituitary

    axis,

    and

    more

    precisely

    the

    hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the hypothalamic-

    pituitary-adrenal axis [59]. This endocrine dysregulation is

    associated with a series of symptoms in AN such as amenor-

    rhea and bone loss. Indeed, AN is usually associated with

    low bone mineral density and osteoporosis (i.e., skeletal fra-

    gility due to bone loss) [60]. In this regard, there are

    implantable biosensors for monitoring bone health [61]. In

    other words, biosensors can help monitor a series of bio-

    chemicals associated with this endocrine dysregulation,

    including adipokines and gut peptides related to energy bal-

    ance, hunger and satiety (e.g., Leptin, Ghrelin, Neuropeptide

    Y, Peptide YY), hormones related to the menstrual cycle,

    stress, sleep, and others (e.g., oxytocin, growth hormone,

    luteinizing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, pro-

    gesterone, testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, etc.), and even key

    processes such as the chronobiology of hormones [2, 62–66].

    BioMed Research International

    Clearly, there are many possibilities to integrate implantable

    biosensors in the healthcare and treatment of AN. However,

    once again, it is important to evaluate the ethical trade-oﬀs.

    Implantable biosensors can also be used in the design of

    implantable drug delivery systems to release localized and

    controlled amounts of drugs [2]. Thus, a venue of interest

    for these biosensors is its use in the design of nanoscale drug

    delivery systems, such as plant-based nanotechnology (phy-

    tonanotechnology) for the delivery of herbal drugs [67, 68].

    For example, there is a “renaissance” in the interest for psy-

    chedelics like the nonsynthetic ayahuasca, psilocybin, mes-

    caline, peyote [69]. Studies have shown promising eﬀects of

    psychedelics on key evolved psychological mechanisms like

    cognitive ﬂexibility [70, 71]. Cognitive ﬂexibility (i.e., the

    ability to shift perspective to adapt to a changing environ-

    ment or a new habitat), and in a more general way, behavior

    ﬂexibility (e.g., to anticipate others’ actions and acting

    accordingly), have evolutive roots that allow developmental

    adaptation throughout life [72–74]. Individuals with AN dis-

    play lower cognitive ﬂexibility compared to healthy controls,

    although most suitable assessment tools are necessary to bet-

    ter explain this deﬁcit and diﬀerences [75–77]. Future stud-

    ies can evaluate the use of biosensors to design implantable

    drug delivery systems that employ psychedelics such as aya-

    huasca or psilocybin to enhance key adaptive psychological

    mechanisms like cognitive ﬂexibility in AN. A similar

    approach can be used in the design of nutrient delivery sys-

    tems to improve nutrient bioavailability [78] in individuals

    with AN.

    Other group of implantable biosensors are ingestible

    sensors for gastrointestinal monitoring [19, 79]. For exam-

    ple, the SmartPill motility testing system (Medtronic)

    includes a smart pill that travels through the gastrointestinal

    tract and a software that provides valuable sensor data such

    as gastric emptying time, colonic transit time, pH, tempera-

    ture, and pressure from the antrum and duodenum (https://

    www.medtronic.com/). Other smart pills have been designed

    to sample the gut microbiome [80]. Individuals with AN

    present a series of gastrointestinal complications including

    constipation and bloating, with decreased gastric motility

    and delayed gastric emptying as the most common underly-

    ing causes, although the causes of gastric dysmotility in AN

    require further research [81]. Regarding the gut microbiota,

    preliminary results suggest that further research is needed to

    better characterize the gut microbiome in AN [82–84].

    Future research can use ingestible sensors to monitor these

    gastrointestinal complications and provide a better proﬁle

    of the gut microbiome in AN.

    Finally, an emergent technology of implantable body

    sensing that is attracting the attention of scientists, inven-

    tors, and companies is smart dust, considered “the future

    of humans monitoring” [85]. Based on technologies such

    as

    complementary

    metal-oxide-semiconductor

    (CMOS)

    and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), a smart dust

    system can consist of thousands of sensor nodes or motes

    (below 100 μm of size and ultra-low powered), which can

    sense chemicals, light, magnetism, vibration, acceleration,

    and temperature [85]. For human monitoring, these sensor

    nodes can be inserted in the human body (e.g., by drinking

    water), and neural dust and body dust are probably the most

    relevant of these technologies for mental healthcare. Neural

    dust is expected to provide neural recording and neural

    stimulation [85–87]. However, the present size of these

    devices (at a millimeter scale) is still a limitation, and brain

    activity recording via neural dust is still at the conceptual

    and simulation level [85]. Similarly, body dust is expected

    to track key biochemical reaction pathways (i.e., metabolic

    pathways, signaling pathways) involved in human biological

    systems. Diﬀerent eﬀorts are being made to downscale the

    size of these sensors and turn them feasible to produce and

    use [88, 89]. This advancement in the miniaturization of

    sensing technologies coupled with nanomaterials with out-

    standing properties (e.g., graphene composites), optoelec-

    tronics (i.e., using light for sensing, recording, stimulating,

    and controlling), and quantum sensing [9] for the develop-

    ment

    of

    optoneuroelectronic

    or

    optoelectrophysiology

    devices [87, 90] could also help bring innovations in this

    area.

    In the future, more individuals with AN could eventually

    beneﬁt from implantable sensing technology. However, it is

    important to highlight that the need to use these technolo-

    gies should be evaluated prior to its implementation in the

    treatment of AN. In the case they are approved, they should

    be used under strict regulation to accomplish ethical guide-

    lines and recommendations. Moreover, we suggest that

    implantable biosensors should not be used as a standalone

    device, but rather used as the ﬁrst layer of a smart healthcare

    system aimed to provide personalized care in the treatment

    of individuals with AN.

    (2) Epidermal Sensors. Most biosensors are usually mini-

    mally invasive and can monitor, for example, glucose levels

    [91]. This noninvasive approach is commonly employed to

    measure physiological signals like pulse or heart rate by

    attaching sensors to the skin [66]. These epidermal sensors

    are skin-inspired electronics typically ultrathin, soft, and

    stretchable, giving the appearance of a second skin or tattoo

    [10, 66, 92]. An example of this technology is the 5x5mm

    Lab-on-Skin sensing chip developed by Xsensio (https://

    xsensio.com), to track biomarkers in human sweat [93, 94].

    Similar soft and ﬂexible electrochemical bioelectronics have

    been developed with the appearance of a wristband or band

    aid to measure sweat samples [95, 96], wound pH [97],

    pulse, breath, and body movement [98], among others [10].

    Individuals with AN are known to present altered phys-

    iological responses to certain stimuli like high-calorie food

    (e.g., ice cream, pizza) [99] or images of human bodies

    (e.g., their own body, ultra-thin female bodies) [100]. There-

    fore, there are several opportunities to use epidermal sensors

    for the continuous measurement of various physiological

    responses in AN. For example, electrodermal activity

    (EDA) sensors to monitor skin conductance response (gal-

    vanic skin response), together with epidermal sensors of

    heart rate, and cortisol, can provide overall a continuous

    real-time measurement of stress levels, as it can be done with

    commercial devices [101]. However, it should be noted that

    epidermal

    sensors

    are

    commercially

    less

    developed

    3

    BioMed Research International

    compared with wearable commercial sensors that have been

    used more frequently [101, 102]. In any case it is important

    to highlight that both require a rigorous validation involving

    the preprocessing of raw data (e.g., noise reduction), signal

    processing, and feature extraction [103, 104].

    (3) Wearable and Portable Sensors. Perhaps the most famous

    sensors among consumers are wearable sensors such as

    smart watches and portable sensors such as smartphones

    that incorporate a camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, light

    detection, etc. The main diﬀerence between the epidermal

    sensors mentioned above and the wearable sensors men-

    tioned here, are that the former are ultrathin, soft, and ﬂex-

    ible skin-attached sensors, whereas the latter are commonly

    rigid and not exclusively used in contact with the skin.

    Examples of wearable and portable sensor devices include

    mobile

    electroencephalography

    (EEG),

    smart

    glasses

    (including eye-tracker glasses), smart contact lens (rigid,

    soft), helmet, headband, earring, earpiece, ﬁngertip, rigid

    wristband, belt, smart textiles (e.g., bra, shirt, sock), and fork

    [19]. As can be seen, there are diﬀerent wearable and porta-

    ble devices, but we will cover just three devices of interest for

    the healthcare and treatment of AN, prior to covering wear-

    able biosensors.

    The ﬁrst sensor of interest is the portable Sensing Fork

    designed by Kadomura et al. [105] as part of a mobile based

    system to promote healthy eating among children. What is

    interesting about this system is that it integrates several ele-

    ments of an intelligent system: a sensor, a gamiﬁed smart-

    phone application (app), a food type classiﬁer, an eating

    action classiﬁer, and feedback to the user [105]. A similar

    device, the HAPIfork, has been developed by the company

    Hapilabs (https://hapilabs.com).

    Mobile EEG sensors are commonly used as a brain-

    computer interface (BCI) to track brain neural activity

    [106, 107] and to provide neurofeedback in controlled set-

    tings [108, 109] or “in the wild” through mobile phone apps

    for consumers (e.g., the Muse headband). Although com-

    pared to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it

    has a poorer spatial resolution, it has good temporal resolu-

    tion, it is portable, and inexpensive [110]. The United States

    has funded research on BCI through “the Defense Advanced

    Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research

    Lab, the Air Force Research Laboratory, and other organiza-

    tions” [111, 112]. Although most of the funding focused on

    neuroprosthetics for the treatment of patients with trau-

    matic brain injury, major limb amputation, among others;

    it had an enormous impact on the development of compa-

    nies interested in commercializing BCI-based solutions

    [113]. Among the most popular BCI devices, we have the

    open hardware OpenBCI, the Emotiv EPOC, the Muse

    headband, and the NeuroSky’s EEG biosensor.

    Eye-trackers are other well-known sensors used for var-

    ious purposes including research on advertising [114, 115],

    gender attitudes [116], body-related attentional bias [117],

    and eating disorders [118–121]. Although desktop eye-

    tracking devices are by far more precise, wearable eye-

    trackers provide descent resolution and sampling rates

    [122]. Popular eye-trackers include Pupil Labs glasses, Tobii

    glasses, SMI glasses, and low-cost solutions like Remo-

    teEye [123].

    Finally, wearable biosensors employ a biological recogni-

    tion element (receptor) and a transducer (e.g., electrode) to

    detect bioﬂuids [124, 125]. Biosensors can use diﬀerent

    receptors, such as enzymatic electrochemical biosensors to

    detect glucose, uric acid, lactate, and hydrogen peroxide;

    intact living cells to work as cell sensors and microbial sen-

    sors; antibodies to act as immunosensors; and even nucleic

    acids (e.g., aptamers) to recognize molecules [125]. There-

    fore, wearable biosensors can have diﬀerent functionality,

    such as detecting metabolic parameters (e.g., pH, electro-

    lytes), physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin tempera-

    ture), and even toxic chemicals like organophosphate

    compounds [126]. A recent review of electrochemical aﬃn-

    ity biosensors details a series of devices to detect hormones

    and metabolites that can be of relevance for the treatment

    of AN, like the aforementioned cortisol, leptin, ghrelin,

    growth hormone, estradiol, among others [65].

    Wearable biosensor devices worth mentioning include

    contact lenses and eyeglasses for tear biosensing [127, 128],

    the 61 x 41 x 5.5 mm VivaLINK (https://www.vivalink

    .com/) axillary patch to measure temperature, the 90 x 20

    x 7.9 mm cardiac patch from the same company, textile sen-

    sors (smart textile) for sweat analysis [129], to name just a

    few. In fact, the list of wearable biosensors and their applica-

    tions is so extensive that we refer the reader to previous work

    [19, 66, 103, 124, 126, 130–133].

    1.1.2. Sociometric Sensors. The quantity and quality of inter-

    personal relationships exert a strong inﬂuence in shaping the

    individual’s aﬀect, cognition, and behavior. Social network

    analysis has been used for a long time to study human social

    interaction

    [134].

    Traditional

    sociometric

    techniques

    employ self-reports about friendships and networks, provid-

    ing a valuable but limited view of human interactions [135].

    In this regard, computational science methods that include

    sensing technology, social physics, and simulations can pro-

    vide accurate measures of human social interaction and

    remarkably precise predictions of individual and collective

    human behavior [136, 137]. Therefore, in this group, we

    consider as a sociometric sensor any sensor (i.e., implant-

    able, epidermal, wearable, portable) that can provide rele-

    vant social data.

    For example, the growing adoption of 5G technology

    and pervasive wireless sensors in smart spaces (i.e., smart

    cities, smart organizations including smart hospitals, and

    smart homes) provide a ﬁne-grained collection of social sig-

    nals, allowing a continuous remote monitoring of human

    daily life activities and social interactions. In this scenario,

    sociometric sensor devices have been developed to provide

    accurate measures of interpersonal proximity and verbal

    communication [138–141]. Sociometric data collected by

    sensors in daily life settings can be used to examine peer pro-

    cesses and family processes in AN with the possibility to

    identify cliques (e.g., group of friends), inﬂuence agents in

    the network, and key communication and interaction pro-

    cesses known to shape social norms within groups [142].

    BioMed Research International

    Similarly, sociometric sensors can be used to examine group

    interactions, communication, collaboration, and overall

    group dynamics [143] among healthcare professionals

    [144]. In sum, methodologies from computer science and

    social sciences (i.e., computational social sciences) can be

    employed for social data mining (e.g., using sociometric sen-

    sors), social signal processing [145], simulation (e.g., agent-

    based models), and interventions [146].

    1.1.3. Ambient Sensors. In this category, we basically have

    outdoor and indoor ambient sensors. Regarding outdoor

    sensors, many urban cities are equipped with environment-

    embedded sensors to measure physical conditions such as

    humidity, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and wind for

    weather forecasting. In fact, there are several types of out-

    door sensors: soil moisture sensors for irrigation manage-

    ment; air quality sensors to track pollution; and city

    cameras, including thermal cameras and AI cameras, for

    security, traﬃc management, people counting, monitoring

    energy transformers to avoid overheating, etc.

    Along with these sensors, we have satellite data, location

    data, and a geographic information system (GIS) to, for

    example, map the surrounding built environment of citizens.

    Although all these data from ambient sensors and geoloca-

    tion apparently seem disparate, we can use computer vision,

    signal processing, simulation, machine learning and AI, to

    analyze a built environment, identify patterns like individual

    and group human behavior within cities, and predict future

    patterns [147].

    The built environment of a neighborhood has an impor-

    tant eﬀect on health behaviors. For example, built environ-

    ments can facilitate open air physical activity if they

    provide suitable infrastructure like walking paths [148]. Sim-

    ilarly, healthy food availability and accessibility in living sur-

    roundings can facilitate healthy eating [149]. Individuals

    with AN struggle with food and it could be even worse if

    the surrounding living environment does not provide

    healthy food choices (e.g., the so-called “food deserts”) or

    food that ﬁts a personally tailored nutrition [150, 151]. Fur-

    thermore, high levels of physical activity are common in

    individuals with AN [152, 153], and this overactivity has

    been linked to thermoregulation and ambient temperature

    [154], both of which can be measured with sensors.

    Therefore,

    environment-embedded

    sensors

    can

    be

    implemented in indoor and outdoor spaces to measure

    diverse conditions like temperature, ambient radio signals

    (e.g., Wi-Fi), air quality, location, etc. Then, we can integrate

    the information of the built environment that surrounds

    individuals with AN with the data of their indoor living con-

    ditions, into intelligent systems for healthcare monitoring.

    For example, weather forecasting data with previous individ-

    ual’s mobility and sleep patterns [155] could predict physical

    overactivity in outdoors in AN. An intelligent system that

    integrates this information together with real-time air qual-

    ity data [156] can send an SMS reminder to the user to avoid

    excessive exercise and reduce his exposure to air pollution,

    the latter linked to cardiovascular diseases [157, 158]. In a

    similar fashion, data from global positioning system (GPS)

    and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been used

    to monitor the food environment and food and eating pat-

    terns [159].

    As we will see below [160], there are many other oppor-

    tunities to integrate ambient sensors in intelligent systems

    for healthcare monitoring.

    1.2. Intelligent Systems. Intelligent systems for healthcare

    monitoring can be designed to relieve the burden of

    healthcare professionals, reduce costs, and improve the

    treatment of individuals with AN. In this regard, it is impor-

    tant to integrate sensor data with traditional data from the

    clinical history and physical examination, laboratory tests,

    self-reports, etc. For example, Figure 1 shows an intelligent

    system that employs machine learning models integrating

    sensor data and traditional data (e.g., self-reports) to provide

    feedback to the caregiver, physician, and patient.

    First, given that we can acquire data from multiple sen-

    sors, sensor fusion is recommended to enhance the quality

    of the data collected by the sensors [161]. For example, if

    the signal of a heart sensor is aﬀected by noise (e.g., move-

    ment), heart data from additional sensors can ensure the

    reliability of heart monitoring [161]. Similarly, sensor fusion

    can be used to obtain data that cannot be obtained by iso-

    lated sensor data [161].

    Then, the architecture to process these multisensor sen-

    sor data can be a decentralized distributed architecture

    [162, 163], like a network of nodes with a hierarchical struc-

    ture. For example, we can employ Wireless Sensor Networks

    (WSNs), which are networks of scattered wireless sensors to

    collect diverse physical data from the environment [164],

    together with Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) that

    comprise body sensors located in diﬀerent parts of the body

    [98, 161]. The ﬁrst layer in this hierarchy constitutes the

    edge computing layer that retrieves the data from body sen-

    sors, RFIDs, etc. These data are forwarded to a fog comput-

    ing layer (e.g., a Raspberry Pi, a smartphone), which acts as

    the connecting link between the edge layer and the cloud

    computing (the highest layer in this hierarchy), reducing

    latency and enhancing eﬃciency [165]. Finally, cloud com-

    puting can be leveraged to perform the most arduous tasks,

    including the use of artiﬁcial intelligence (e.g., graph neural

    networks) for classiﬁcation and predictive analytics.

    Although, the need to use cloud services should be eval-

    uated in terms of cybersecurity, privacy, conﬁdentiality, and

    environmental sustainability [162]. Moreover, improve-

    ments in radio technology (e.g., 6G standard, autonomous,

    dynamic, distributed, adaptive wireless networks), will allow

    more eﬃcient infrastructures depending less on remote

    cloud services. For example, Amazon Web Service (AWS)

    Wavelength (https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/features/)

    is a mobile edge computing infrastructure that embeds

    AWS services within 5G networks, reducing the need for

    mobile applications to heavily rely on remote cloud servers.

    There are several examples of a three-layer architecture

    for healthcare monitoring. Niu et al. [98] developed the

    bodyNET system that employs ﬁve wearable epidermal sen-

    sor nodes and smart textiles that operate with a smartphone

    via Bluetooth, and a cloud server via cellular network, for

    pulse detection, breath detection, and body movement

    5

    BioMed Research International

    detection. Similar systems have been used for tracking eating

    behavior [166] to predict heart failure [167, 168] and mental

    health issues such as depression [169].

    However, perhaps the most promising venue of intelli-

    gent systems in healthcare is to provide tailored interven-

    tions

    at

    real-time

    using

    mobile

    health

    (mHealth)

    technology, digital twin (e.g., a digital replica of a patient),

    social robotics, or others. That is the case of digital just-in-

    time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) or ecological momen-

    tary interventions [170–174] that can adopt a human-aware

    AI (or human-centered AI, i.e., AI systems that are centered

    on the user) approach [175] and a context-aware approach

    [168, 174]. In this case, these intelligent systems are

    grounded in both evidence-based interventions (e.g., behav-

    ior change theories) and continuous learning (e.g., reinforce-

    ment learning), to provide a user-friendly experience

    tailored to the needs of the user. For example, a JITAIs can

    be a gamiﬁed mobile app grounded in Cognitive Behavioral

    Therapy (CBT), and the mechanisms of behavior change

    [176, 177] that delivers reminders or instructions to support

    decision making, behavior change, activities of daily life, etc.

    These alerts can beneﬁt individuals with AN and those mon-

    itoring their treatment [170]. Sensing technologies can be

    key in designing these intelligent systems, and these systems

    can be integrated together with traditional interventions to

    provide a smarter healthcare in AN.

    2. Discussion

    This review focused on the integration of sensor technology

    and intelligent systems, to provide smarter healthcare deliv-

    ery systems in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Through this narra-

    tive review, we have seen that to design and deploy these

    intelligent systems, we require the eﬀort of professionals

    from diverse ﬁelds. Domain expertise in the ﬁeld of eating

    disorders, healthcare management, sensor technologies,

    internet of things (IoT), big data, data science, artiﬁcial intel-

    ligence is required, among others. However, global chal-

    lenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic or climate change,

    have demonstrated that the deployment of intelligent sys-

    tems is feasible through cooperation and consilience across

    diﬀerent disciplines, and it fosters innovation scaling [178].

    Current interventions that use technology, particularly

    mobile technology (i.e., mHealth interventions) for the treat-

    ment of eating disorders such as AN are scarce, but the use

    of evidence-based techniques, gamiﬁcation, and the possibil-

    ity of remote monitoring and guidance are just some of the

    factors that can make them attractive for patients and clini-

    cians [179–182]. Therefore, as we have seen previously, there

    are several opportunities to integrate sensing technology and

    foster innovation in the ﬁeld of eating disorders, particularly

    in healthcare settings. Anorexia Nervosa aﬀects the lives of

    millions of women and is a chronic condition that deserves

    the careful attention of health professionals but can create

    a burden among them. Sensing technologies can relieve this

    burden if they are used to not only provide data but also

    used particularly if they are embedded in intelligent systems

    for smarter healthcare of patients with eating disorders.

    In this regard, we highlight the fact that there is a fast

    development in the manufacture of new and low-cost elec-

    tronic devices, particularly in modern cities like Shenzhen

    (China). We have mentioned above that these new technol-

    ogies, like polymer and graphene composite-based nanosen-

    sors, quantum sensors, will be the future of human

    monitoring. As we also mentioned, there are ethical con-

    cerns that arise from ubiquitous technologies. However, we

    must also mention environmental and sustainability issues

    related to the manufacture of sensor technologies. For exam-

    ple, intelligent cameras with computer vision capabilities can

    be used for healthcare but require higher power consumption

    and materials like lithium or gold, that usually have high and

    hidden environmental costs. In summary, it is important to

    BioMed Research International

    recognize along the ethical issues mentioned above, the envi-

    ronmental sustainability of the manufacture and use of these

    sensors. Future research should consider alternatives to man-

    made sensors, such as nature-based biosensors. For example,

    plants used as sensors (phytosensors), are a more sustainable

    alternative, have higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity, and can be

    used for human monitoring [183, 184].

    Finally, we have shown how sensor technologies can be

    integrated in the treatment of AN through the design and

    deployment of intelligent systems supported by artiﬁcial

    intelligence. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that there

    are established network standards (e.g., IEEE 802.15.6 for

    WBANs), device standards (e.g., IEEE/ISO 11073-10420-

    2010 for body composition analysis), and communication

    standards (e.g., Proxy Mobile IPv6, PMIPv6 by the Internet

    Engineering Task Force, IETF) for these systems. However,

    to implement more advanced and future intelligent systems,

    we need to design new standards and protocols that require

    the collaboration and synergy of diﬀerent professionals. To

    give an example, there is a joint eﬀort to build cyberphysical

    social systems, which includes what is called Societies 5.0, a

    new paradigm to modeling and managing complex systems

    such as societies [185, 186]. The transition towards these

    cyberphysical social systems, and more particularly cyber-

    physical medical systems [187], urgently requires interdisci-

    plinary

    collaboration

    [188].

    For

    example,

    there

    are

    cybersecurity issues, like cyberattacks to healthcare devices

    [187], that can be solved with secured protocols and stan-

    dards [189, 190]. Importantly, cyberphysical social systems

    can be used for behavior monitoring [191], and therefore

    they have a great potential for smarter healthcare at the indi-

    vidual and population level.

    3. Conclusions

    In conclusion, sensing technologies and intelligent systems

    can be designed and deployed for smarter healthcare for

    AN. However, there are technical, ethical, and environmen-

    tal sustainability issues that must be considered prior to

    implementing these systems. A joint collaboration of profes-

    sionals and other members of the society involved in the

    healthcare of individuals with AN can help in the develop-

    ment of these systems. The evolution of cyberphysical sys-

    tems should be considered in these collaborations.

  title: 'Sensor Technology and Intelligent Systems in Anorexia Nervosa: Providing
    Smarter Healthcare Delivery Systems'
  verbatim_quote1: Sensor technology and intelligent systems can be employed for smarter
    healthcare delivery systems in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). In this regard, sensing
    technologies for the healthcare of AN can be divided into diﬀerent categories.
    In this group, we categorize them as implantable (injectable, insertable, or ingestible),
    epidermal (skin-attached), and wearable and portable [19].
  verbatim_quote2: Implantable sensors can also be used for neural sensing (e.g.,
    brain neural recording), intracranial neurostimulation (invasive deep brain stimulation,
    DBS), neuromodulation, and neurofeedback [25–36]. The neuroanatomical areas of
    major interest for the treatment of AN have been the brain’s subcallosal cingulate
    cortex and the nucleus accumbens [36–40].

    \ date\nAbstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a thriving technol-\nogy in almost\
    \ all ﬁelds of human life to make their lives easy.\nSmart Agriculture is one\
    \ of the IoT applications on which\nfarmers are widely switching to improve productivity\
    \ and re-\nduce labor costs. As IoT involves the Internet, data transmis-\nsion\
    \ technology creates the possibility of privacy/security\nbreaches concerning\
    \ users’ data. The cybercrime rate may\nalso increase in IoT-based agriculture\
    \ (IoTA). Thus there\nmust be ready concerning digital forensics in IoTA. Various\n\
    review articles are available regarding the emerging cyber\nattack, cybercrime,\
    \ and forensics challenges in IoT appli-\ncations like smart home, smart city,\
    \ smart healthcare, smart\ngrid, smart retail, smart supply chain management,\
    \ and smart\nagriculture, while a few review articles on IoTA security and\nforensic\
    \ challenges. This review paper is focused on IoTA\nsolutions and their security\
    \ and forensics challenges. The\nsystematic literature review method has been\
    \ used for this\nstudy which includes articles published from 2011 - 2021.\nThis\
    \ article has brought the limelight on IoT architecture\nand its application in\
    \ agricluture (IoTA) to emphasize on\nits introduction, architecture, challenges\
    \ and issues related\nemerging cybercrimes and digital forensics. At the end,\
    \ this\nreview paper discusses various challenges in securing IoTA\nsystems and\
    \ presents future directions for research.\n1 Introduction\nInternet of things\
    \ (IoT) refers to interconnected things. Karl\nSteinbuch, a German computer science\
    \ pioneer, said, \"In a\nfew decades, computers will be interwoven into almost\
    \ ev-\nery industrial product .\" IoT is frequently used in the do-\nmains like\
    \ healthcare, food and restaurant industry, travel\nand tourism industry and library\
    \ services, smart home, smart\nae-mail: santoshi.phdcs21@nfsu.ac.in\nbe-mail:\
    \ parag.rughani@nfsu.ac.in\ngrid, smart retail and smart agriculture [1] [2].\
    \ The IoT mar-\nket value projected to reach from 157 billion USD in 2016\nto\
    \ 771 billion USD by 2026. Cisco predicted that by 2030,\n500 billion objects\
    \ would be connected and linked up to the\nInternet [3].\nFood Requirement will\
    \ increase by 70% more to supply\nfor an estimated population of 10.1 billion\
    \ by 2050, says the\nUN Food & Agriculture Report [4]. The volatility of food\n\
    prices, climate change and timely harvest forecasts are cru-\ncial to counteract,\
    \ which has a major impact on the economy\nand is closely linked to issues such\
    \ as malnutrition, and un-\ndernourishment, [5] [6] [7]. By 2050 the global population\n\
    of 9 billion people will face the challenge of feeding [8].\nTo deal with these\
    \ challenges and meet the need of future\nfood requirements. Agriculture 5.0 implies\
    \ that farms are\nfollowing Precision Agriculture principles and using equip-\n\
    ment that involves crewless operations and autonomous de-\ncision support systems\
    \ using the IoTA, robotics and AI [9].\nMany developed and developing counties\
    \ are widely using\nIoT based Agriculture (IoTA). It is observed that the 26.7%\n\
    global population and approximately 58% of the Indian pop-\nulation rely on agriculture\
    \ and farming to meet their liveli-\nhood. The Economic Survey of India 2020-21\
    \ report stated\nthat in FY20, the total food grain production was recorded at\n\
    296.65 million tonnes by India [10]. This high dependency\nmakes agriculture a\
    \ signiﬁcant factor in improving higher-\nyielding and better quality agriculture\
    \ and farming produc-\ntion. These higher-yielding and better quality requirements\n\
    are being taken with the help of technology. Many of the\ndeveloped and developing\
    \ countries are transforming into\nIoTA.\nIoTA is a smart technique where the\
    \ researchers have\nbeen working on inventing tools and techniques for improv-\n\
    ing the production and quality in agriculture and farming.\nIn general, technologies\
    \ like GPS (Global Positioning Sys-\ntem), sensor networks and remote sensing\
    \ are used in IoTA\n2\n[11][12]. IoTA is helpful for various farm activities like\
    \ crop\nmonitoring, automated irrigation system, insect/pest moni-\ntoring, warehousing\
    \ of food, supply chain and smart farming\nsuch as livestock management, livestock\
    \ disease monitoring,\ndairy management [13]. Many IT organizations like Google,\n\
    Microsoft, Watson, IBM, Intel, Jasper, CISCO, Dell, HPE,\nHello Tractors, Farm\
    \ 2050 and Qualcomm are continuously\ndeveloping IoTA solutions that would have\
    \ a huge economic\nimpact [14]. The authors also estimate 2.7−6.2 trillion each\n\
    year, which will bring evolution in agriculture [15]. At present,\nmore than 26\
    \ billion smart devices are in circulation, while\na forecast says that this number\
    \ will triple within the coming\n5-6 years [16].\nThis paper presents a review\
    \ of different papers on IoT\ndevices supporting agricultural use, focusing on\
    \ the applica-\ntions, the emerging cyber attack and cyber crime (CACC)\nand Digital\
    \ Forensics (DF) challenges. With many farms\n(plant and livestock, small and\
    \ large) using automation and\nremote, networked sensors to monitor and manage\
    \ the op-\nerations, from watering and feeding, to growth and health\nmonitoring,\
    \ this is a sector that has not traditionally been as-\nsociated with high risks\
    \ of computer and network security\nproblems impacting their operation. And when\
    \ security is,\nat best, an afterthought, the enterprise can be at risk. Since\n\
    the number of IoTA solutions will rise, the number of crimes\non smart agriculture\
    \ may also increase soon. Sensitive data\nprocessed through IoTA could be a luring\
    \ means for hacking\ntargets by cyber criminals targeting the agricultural sector\n\
    for ﬁnancial gain, cyber warfare, activist/political purposes,\nor to obtain intellectual\
    \ property and technological advance-\nments. This study aims to review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁelds\nof IoTA based CACC and DF challenges as listed below.\n–\

    \ followed the article selection method-\nology using the method Systematic Literature\
    \ Review (SLR)\nshows a representation in Fig 1. The ﬁrst step was to choose\n\
    reputed journals for selecting articles from there. The second\nphase of SLR was\

    \ Xplore, Springer, Wi-\nley, MDPI, Inderscience, Taylor, Francis and UGC care-listed\n\
    journals. We considered the articles which were published\nbetween 2011 and 2021.\
    \ We have also considered a few\nwhitepapers, statistical survey papers and websites\
    \ to refer\nIoTA based tools. We have considered various IoTA relevant\nkeyword\
    \ search to ﬁnd relevant articles. The keywords were\n(\"Internet of Things\"\

    \ this SLR method, we could identiﬁed 111 articles\nfor the study. In these articles\
    \ 91 were journal papers, 12\nconference papers and 8 book chapters. We have referred\
    \ 3\nwhite papers and 10 websites additionally. The selected pa-\npers were analyzed,\
    \ considered and classiﬁed for IoTA and\nfarming applications of the method used\
    \ in this review for\narticle selection.\n3 IoT Based Agriculture (IoTA)\nIoTA\
    \ is an automated functioning system in which devices\ncommunicate over the Internet\
    \ and function according to the\nrequirements of the resources. The IoTA refers\
    \ to the usage\nof the Internet to connect sensors, Single Board Computer\n(SBC)\
    \ and servers. The Sensors sense the agriculture envi-\nronment status (plants,\
    \ crops, animals and their relative pa-\nrameters such as soil moisture, soil\
    \ nutrient ingredients, pest\nimages, water quality, climate, humidity, temperature,\
    \ crop\nstatus, animal health and reproductive system). The sensed\ndata is to\
    \ be sent to the SBC. SBCs such as Node MCU, Ar-\nduino, Raspberry pi and others\
    \ decide according to set con-\nditioned values and update the agriculture status\
    \ using the\n3\nFig. 1: Review Article Selection Method\nInternet. IoTA is used\
    \ for increasing the quality and quan-\ntity of agriculture production so that\
    \ the agriculture can be\nmonitored or operated from remote places and the action\
    \ be\ntaken by IoTA as per the requirement of the plants and an-\nimals. It reduces\
    \ the monitoring and labor costs [17]. IoTA\nallows devices to operate automatically\
    \ so that the chores in\nagriculture can be monitored and controlled remotely.\
    \ IoTA\nis being adopted widely to reduce labor costs and improve\nproductivity.\
    \ IoTA applications can manage land, animals,\ncrops and farms without human intervention.\
    \ IoTA is also re-\nferred to as smart agriculture[18], precision agriculture\
    \ [19]\n[20], digital farming [21], smart farming[22] [23], digital\nagriculture\
    \ [24].\n4 IoTA Architecture\nIn general, there are ﬁve layers in IoTA architecture\
    \ i.e. ap-\nplication layer, middleware layer, network layer, edge layer,\nphysical\
    \ layer. The illustrated with the diagram as shown\nin Fig 2 IoTA architecture\
    \ with its basic components such\nas sensors, SBC, gateway, cloud and the Internet\
    \ [25] [26]\n[27].\nIn [28] by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union\n\
    Telecommunication Standard Sector) had been supposed four\nlayered architecture\
    \ for holistic IoT. The ﬁrst is device layer\nwhich interacts with hardwares like\
    \ sensors, actuators, RFID\ntags and GPS in IoT. The second is network layer which\n\
    performs functions such as networking, communication and\ntransport. The third\
    \ layer is service and application support\nlayer and the topmost layer IoT application\
    \ layer, which\nmanages IoT applications.\nIn IoT World Forum 2014, [29] has presented\
    \ 7 layer\nbased IoT achitecture reference model by the combination\nof three\
    \ layered and ﬁve layered IoT architectures. The lay-\ners included are physical,\
    \ connectivity, edge computing, data\naccumulation, data absraction, application\
    \ and collaboration\nand processes. The physical layer manages things in IoT,\n\
    connectivity layer is resposible for communication and pro-\ncessing units. The\
    \ edge computing layer analyze data ele-\nment and transforms it. The data accumulation\
    \ layer works\nas a storage of data to be recived or sent. The abstraction\nlayer\
    \ performs aggregation and access of the data. The ap-\nplication layer controls,\
    \ performs analytics and presents re-\nport of the functionality of IoT regarding\
    \ present environ-\nment. The collaboration and process layer includes people\n\
    and business processes.\n[30] proposed a three layerd based IoTA architecture.\n\
    The authors adopted the concept of fog coputing and cloud\ncomputing in this architecture.\
    \ In which, the ﬁrst layer named\nas IoT layer includes IoTA devices such as sensors,\
    \ drones,\nSBC and actuators. The sensor measures the environmental\nvariables\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\nactivates the actuator to\
    \ perform respective function in the\nagriculture. Second is the fog layer where\
    \ IoTA devices are\nconnected with gateways by LoRaWAN or other network.\nThe\
    \ third layer is cloud layer which deals with API’s to man-\nage the data received\
    \ from the agricultral environment.\n[31] proposed four layer based IoTA architecture.\
    \ In this\nIoTA architecture, the perception layer is consists of phys-\nical\
    \ devices like sensor, actuators and microcontroller. The\nsensors fetch the data\
    \ of sensed agriculture environment and\nstored into the local server; Subsequently\
    \ after error anal-\nysis precised data is uploaded to the cloud. The network\n\
    layer performs abstraction of raw data recieved from the per-\nception layer and\
    \ trasnsmit on to the upper layers. The sen-\nsors are connected distinct communication\
    \ newtwork com-\nmunication technologies such as wireless networks like 4G,\n\
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee. The middleware layer provides\ninter-communication between\
    \ network layer and application\n4\nlayer. It also manages resourses and services\
    \ and performs\noperation the remote database. The application layer is re-\n\
    ceives data from middleware layer. It consists of interface\nmethods and communication\
    \ protocols such as MQTT, AMQL\nand CoAP. It receives encrypted data, decrypts\
    \ it using soft-\nware internally and stores data on the local machine for fu-\n\
    ture use.\n[26], presented IoTA architecture where the 3 main layer\nare discussed.\
    \ Those layer are platform layer, edge layer and\ncommunication layer. The plateform\
    \ layer perform raw data\ncollection IoTA hardwares sensing by the agricultural\
    \ envi-\nronment. The edge layer performs decision making based on\ndata merging\
    \ and processing the sensors data. The commu-\nnication layer comunicates between\
    \ gateway and cloud.\n[32], discussed three layer based IoTA architecture. The\n\
    authors considered device layer, network layer and applica-\ntion layer. They\
    \ did not include middleware layer in their\narticle.\n[33] discussed two categories\
    \ of architecture based on\nholistic IoT applications. That IoT architectures\
    \ were three\nlayered and ﬁve layer according to different vendors of IoT.\nAuthor\
    \ raised the challenge of standarization issue of the\nIoTA architectures.\n[34]\
    \ discussed a common IoTA architecture. The archi-\ntecture consists of three\
    \ layers namely IoTA hardwares, com-\nmunication technologies and data processing\
    \ and storage.\nIoTA hardwares included sensors, actuators, embedded sys-\ntem\
    \ with processor, communication modules, memory, I/O\ninterfaces and battery power.\
    \ The authours have discussed\nvarious communication technoloies such as ZigBee,\
    \ Z-Wave,\n6LoWPAN and NFC, based on various parameters as li-\ncensed, transmission\
    \ distance, frequncy and data rate.\n[35] discussed drawbacks of tradional cloud\
    \ based archi-\ntecture and to overcome the drawbacks they proposed edge\nand\
    \ fog computing architecture for IoTA. The shortcom-\nings of existing system\
    \ were as high energy consumption\nduring agricultural data transfer from and\
    \ to the cloud and\nhigh network traﬁc. The proposed architecture reduces the\n\
    load over cloud layer which minimize the energy consump-\ntion, network traﬁc\
    \ and latency for IoTA applications and\nservices. The proposed architecture consists\
    \ of four layer\nsuch as IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer and cloud\nlayer.\
    \ The IoT sensor layer responsible for all IoTA har-\nwares deployment.The edge\
    \ layer performs computation of\nsensors/actuators data at the edge of the network.\
    \ The fog\nlayer is responsible for process and analyze complex data\nreceived\
    \ from IoTA sensors through edge layer. The cloud\nlayer provides higher scalibility\
    \ and on demand computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing.\n\
    [36] proposed user centrinc IoTA architecture which con-\nsists of three main\
    \ layers perception layer, communication\nlayer and control layer. The perception\
    \ layer is responsi-\nble for data aquisition via sensors. The communication layer\n\
    \ \nPhysical Layer\nSensor                      Actuator                     \

    \ of\nthe acquired data.\n[37] proposed IoTA architecture based on the holistic\n\
    IoTA architecture. This proposed architecture contains six\nlayers namely device\
    \ layer, network layer, session layer, ap-\nplication layer, cloud layer, business\
    \ layer. The business layer\nconsists of several business modules where the information\n\
    can be accessed as per the business nature.\nThe comparision in various IoTA architectures\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Table 1. This table includes total number of layers\nused\
    \ in IoTA, layers name and function of each layer.\nAfter the reviewing the previous\
    \ work there is given lay-\nered architecture based on 5 layers as physical layer,\
    \ edge\nlayer, fog layer, application layer and cloud layer. Each lay-\ners described\
    \ in the cronological way are as follows:\nPhysical Layer: The Physical Layer\
    \ consists of physi-\ncal devices like sensors, actuators, SBC (Single Board Com-\n\
    puter) and a gateway in the farm [38]. This layer senses and\ncollects agricultural\
    \ environment based speciﬁc data through\nsensor devices. Based on the speciﬁc\
    \ type of sensor, the col-\nlected data is about location, temperature, orientation,\
    \ mo-\ntion, vibration, acceleration, humidity and chemical changes\nin the air.\

    \ Layer [40].\nEdge Layer: The edge layer collects raw data from the\nphysical\
    \ layer and proceeds to the network layer based. It\nmerges sensor data and processes\
    \ it [26]. It enables the ac-\ntuators to what the conditioned value has been\
    \ set in the\nﬁrmware of IoTA. For instance, in a smart irrigation sys-\ntem,\
    \ the conditioned unit value for the soil moisture sensor\nis 1000; thus, if the\
    \ sensor provides less than 1000 soil mois-\nture values, the actuation will start.\
    \ Some of the commu-\nnication technologies namely 802.11*, Sigfox, LoRaWAN,\n\
    NBIoT, LTE-3GPP, EC-GPRS, WiMAX, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\nZ-Wave, 6LoWPAN and NFC used\
    \ in IoTA are categorised\nbased on distinct parameters like licenced spectrum,\
    \ trans-\nmission distance, type of network used, frequency, and data\nrate [41]\
    \ [38] [32] [42] [34]. The communication technol-\nogy allows the hardware (in\
    \ the physical layer such as sen-\nsors, actuators and the controller) to communicate\
    \ by wired\nor wireless medium [43]. According to[44], Low-Frequency\nCommunication\
    \ (LFC) is popular in smart villages due to a\nlack of infrastructure. However,\
    \ some prominent high com-\nmunication technology used in IoTA is IEEE 802.15.4,\
    \ Zensy\nWave, Long Term Evolution (LTE), LongRange (LoRa), Near\nField Communication\
    \ (NFC), Ultra-wideband (UWB) and\nothers. These communication technologies help\
    \ to commu-\nnicate hardwares like sensors, actuators in IoTA devices present\n\
    in the farm for are also commonly used in smart villages\nfor different applications\
    \ like postharvest management, cat-\ntle health monitoring and others.\nFog Layer:\
    \ Fog layer is a virtual cloud which recieves\ndata from edge layer and transmits\
    \ it to the upper layers. It\nprocess and analyze complex data received from IoTA\
    \ sen-\nsors through edge layer. It includes fog nodes like gateways,\nrouters,\
    \ entry points, distinct fog servers. The fog nodes sit-\nuates between end devices\
    \ and cloud data centers. This layer\nworks as a local cloud server.It provides\
    \ intra-networked\ncommunication for the IoTA system. By this means the IoTA\n\
    devices communcates through low frequencies and activates\nthe actuators. The\
    \ raw data collected from the sensors do not\nneed to travel frquently over the\
    \ Internet. Hence, the concept\nof fog layer overcomes the drawback like high\
    \ latency be-\ncause of real time control and mitigates security risk about\n\
    data transmission as the Internet were acted as a backbone.\nThus, the compromisation\
    \ of the Internet will lead to com-\nplete obstruction IoTA system [30].\nApplication\
    \ Layer: Application layer consists of vari-\nous communication protocols such\
    \ as HTTP, MQTT, CoAP,\nAMQP and XMPP [45] [46]. This layer provides a graphical\n\
    user interface of the agricultural environment information\nprocessed by the Middleware\
    \ layer in encrypted form and in-\nternally decrypts this information using software,\
    \ thus stores\ndata for further use. The application layer monitors the agri-\n\
    cultural environment and suggests actions to be performed\nto get better throughput\
    \ using IoTA. The applications im-\nplemented by IoTA like smart crop monitoring,\
    \ smart irriga-\ntion, smart fertilizer/pesticides sprinkling, smart greenhouse\n\
    and livestock monitoring. The data is uploaded to the Cloud\nfor data warehousing\
    \ through these applications. Some of\nthe Cloud-based IoTA platforms are AgroCloud,\
    \ AT&T M2X\ncloud, AWS, Azure IoT hub, Blynk, Cropinfra, Dropbox,\nERMES, FIWARE,\
    \ freeboard, Google, GroveStream MACQU,\nMobius, NETPIE, Rural IoT, self-developed,\
    \ SmartFarm-\nNET, ThingSpeak, Ubidots, Nimbits, ThingWorx, Phytech\n[45][46].\n\
    Cloud Layer: The cloud layer works as a centerlised data\nstorage for the IoTA\
    \ system. It receives data through appli-\ncation layer from the fog layer and\
    \ stores it for long time us-\nage. It provides greater scalibility and on demand\
    \ computing\nresources such as storage, networking and processing [35].\n5 IoTA\
    \ Applications\nThe IoTA applications have become very popular among\nfarmers\
    \ due to their efﬁciency and productivity. The IoTA\nsolutions are designed to\
    \ help farmers with time efﬁciency,\nimproved productivity and better monitoring\
    \ of daily agri-\ncultural tasks. Some of the sensors are soil moisture sen-\n\
    sor, temperature sensor, distance sensor, direction sensor,\nlivestock’s temperature\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, ultrasonic\nsensor, acoustic sensors, leaf sensors,\
    \ stem sensors and fruit\nsize sensor. These sensors have speciﬁc functionality\
    \ in IoT\napplications like identifying environment temperature, crop\nstatus,\
    \ soil preparation, irrigation, pest monitoring and de-\ntection [14]. The IoTA\
    \ applications are classiﬁed into two\ncategories crop and livestock based applications.\
    \ Crop based\nIoTA applications are smart irrigation, frost protection, com-\n\
    post management, pest monitoring, pest controlling, weed\ndetection, chemical\
    \ control, seedbed preparation to reseed-\ning, yield analysis and mapping, arable\
    \ farming, spraying,\nvehicle and machinery control, crop assistant, weather con-\n\
    dition, soil quality, agricultural drones UAV, smart green-\nhouse. The applications\
    \ based on livestock management based\nare livestock monitoring, livestock identiﬁcation,\
    \ milking au-\ntomation technology, early disease detection, offspring man-\n\
    agement and care, smart poultry farming.\n[47] discussed the Niger research project\
    \ to highlight\nthe development of IoT-based smart city and smart village\nfor\
    \ the fulﬁllment of sustainable development goals (SDG-\n2030) 11 and 9 for revolution\
    \ through smart cities and smart\nvillages in Niger.\n[23] mainly focused on holistic\
    \ deﬁnitions of IoTA and\nits applications such as crop health, weeding and spraying,\n\
    planting sowing, seedbed preparation to reseeding, planting\nfrom the air, harvesting\
    \ from the ﬁeld, drones for a ﬁeld,\nyielding analysis and mapping.\n7\n[48] described\
    \ the types of agricultural UAV (Harvesting\nUAV, Spraying UAV, Mapping UAV, Sensing\
    \ UAV), includ-\ning their area of application in terms of seeding, planting\n\
    seed, monitoring, detecting weed, mapping, infestation and\nspraying pesticides/fertilizers,\
    \ forecasting and controlling.\n[49] have discussed IoTA applications that have\
    \ utilized\nmodern technologies like WSN, RFID, Cloud Computing\nand end-user\
    \ applications. These IoTA devices are found\nto be automotive, cost and time-efﬁcient\
    \ for the farmers.\nThe authors have also presented IoTA technologies and the\n\
    classiﬁcation of IoTA applications of monitoring activities.\nThe applications\
    \ are irrigation and water quality monitor-\ning, soil monitoring, weather monitoring,\
    \ farm monitoring),\ndisease and pest control, greenhouse production, automa-\n\
    tion and precision, agricultural machinery and crop manage-\nment with other applications\
    \ in smart farming as smart cat-\ntle farming, smart poultry, smart hatchery,\
    \ smart aquaponics\nand smart beehive monitoring.\n[50] did a comprehensive study\
    \ about crop data man-\nagement in agriculture 5.0. The authors displayed a tabular\n\
    analysis of various crop data management applications and\ntheir main features\
    \ based on parameters, namely software,\ncompany, headquarters and relevant features\
    \ .\n[13] discussed various solutions used in IoTA. Few of\nIoTA solutions are\
    \ water quality monitoring, farm land mon-\nitoring system, greenhouse envioronment\
    \ monitoring sys-\ntem, automated hydroponic system, smart mashrrom farm,\nsmart\
    \ vegitable storage, smart vineyard monitoring system\nand others. They compared\
    \ IoTA monitoring and control\nsystems based on parameters like a gateway, sensor\
    \ and ac-\ntuator, communication system, storage, user interface, ex-\nperiment\
    \ nature (outdoor/indoor), plant name/type, advan-\ntages of the existing system\
    \ and weaknesses in the current\nsystem.\n[46] did a thorough review of IoTA applications.\
    \ Based\non the usage, they classiﬁed IoTA applications into two types,\nIndoor\
    \ (i.e., crop beds, greenhouse, hydroponic) and out-\ndoor (arable land, orchard).\
    \ Some other works include IoT\nbased smart greenhouse and precision farming applications\n\
    [51]. In Europe, there is ongoing work on IoTA based re-\nsearch projects [52].\
    \ The classiﬁcation of holistic IoTA ap-\nplications and various IoTA solutions\
    \ are tabulated Table 2\nrespectively.\nIn the few states of India like Orisa,\
    \ Madhya Pradesh\nfaced the problem of crop vandalization. To deal with this\n\
    situation, IoTA based alarming system has been designed.\nWhenever trespassing\
    \ of the elephants is observed, the smart\ncamera detects the suspected activity\
    \ and an alarming sys-\ntem is activated [53].\nIn the next section, we have specialized\
    \ in CACC and\nDF challenges and issues in the IoTA realms.\n6 Existing Emerging\
    \ Cyber Attacks and Cyber Crime\n(CACC) in IoTA\nCyber attack (CA) is a attack\
    \ based on pertaining to digi-\ntal devices and its nework to disturb distrupt\
    \ or destroy the\nservices of the system. The other aim be perform data theft\n\
    or malicious intension of the attackers. As the CA gets re-\nported into the police\
    \ is called as Cyber Crime (CC). CC is\nan unlawfull activity againsts making\
    \ subotage, disruption\nor harm pertaining to any digital device, network, data,\
    \ or\nany living being.\nA senior vice president, Corey Reed with Deere, admit-\n\
    ted that cybercriminals have been looking for farming infor-\nmation.\nDue to\
    \ the interconnectivity of IoTA devices with the\ninternet, there are the possibility\
    \ of various CACC. The at-\ntackers could drive Sprout into a ditch or a hedge\
    \ or prevent\nit from working. In [2] [74], cyber-attack taxonomy included\nvectors,\
    \ viruses, malware, worms, trojans, ransomware, ad-\nware, zero-day vulnerability,\
    \ Stuxnet, exploit toolkit, Bot-\nnet, Man In The Middle (MITM), phishing and\
    \ spooﬁng,\nside channel, DoS, DDoS, RFID based attacks. These cyber-\nattacks\
    \ have included case studies for IoT smart devices.\n[45] the authors covered\
    \ the simulation tools for the vulnera-\nbility assessment of holistic IoT devices,\
    \ i.e., Bevywise IoT\nSimulator, IoTIFY, CupCarbon U-One, Simple IoT Simula-\n\
    tor, Mimic IoT Simulator, Cooja. The authors suggested se-\ncurity measures and\
    \ precautions for the user only. They had\nemphasized cyber-attacks and security\
    \ measures as well.\nIoT has been emphasized greatly since the 90s, when it\n\
    was proposed as an idea of interconnecting different elec-\ntronic devices through\
    \ various technologies. However, dur-\ning the past decade, IoT has rapidly developed\
    \ without con-\nsidering the profound security goals and challenges involved.\n\
    Consequently, the IoTA will face various emerging CACC.\nAccording to Statista,\
    \ by 2025 there will be 75 billion IoT-\nconnected devices [75]. Due to the rapid\
    \ development, it im-\nplies that checking for the security and vulnerability\
    \ assess-\nment is impossible. The absence of a complete trust zone can\nbe detected\
    \ in the microcontrollers used for IoTA devices.\n[76], ForeScout IoT Enterprise\
    \ Risk Report clearly sug-\ngests that by 2018, two-thirds of enterprises will\
    \ experience\nIoT security breaches. It has captured a broader spectrum of\nthe\
    \ security vulnerabilities and attacks in IoT systems. Their\nclassiﬁcation is\
    \ unique compared to the other classiﬁcations\nas it divides the different attacks\
    \ into four distinct classes;\nPhysical, Network, Software, and Encryption attacks.\
    \ The\nsame statement is true for an IoTA system, where the IoTA\ndevices can\
    \ be attacked physically or at its network or to the\napplications. Similarly,\
    \ the attacks can be tried on encryp-\ntion schemes, as IoTA is implemented using\
    \ various existing\nnetwork technologies.\n8\nTable 2: IoTA Solutions and Techniques\n\

    \ emerging Cyber Attacks (CA) in\nIoTA based on each IoTA layer. The CA on the\
    \ physical\nlayer was autonomous system hijacking/disruption, irregular\nmeasurement,\
    \ node capturing and sleep deprivation. Edge\nlayer based attacks were forged\
    \ for control actuator, boot-\ning, ﬂooding and signature wrapping attack. The\
    \ network\nlayer attacks were DoS, DDoS, data transit attacks, routing\nattacks,\
    \ signal disruption, Radiofrequency (RF) Jamming at-\ntacks, side-channel attacks,\
    \ malware injection, and Botnet\nattacks. An application layer based CA were phishing,\
    \ ma-\nlicious scripts, DoS, or DDoS. Cloud computing attacks and\ncyber terrorism\
    \ are other types of attacks have been dis-\ncussed.\n[78], covered network layer\
    \ based CA in IoTA. These\nattacks are replay attacks on Zigbee protocol that\
    \ can create\ndiﬁculties to implemnting other protocols. The smart farm,\nwhich\
    \ uses IEEE 802.11 protocol, can face attacks like pass-\nword cracking and evil\
    \ twin access point, which allows at-\ntackers to get credentials by creating\
    \ a rogue access point.\nKey reinstallation attack, which exploits 4-way handshake\n\
    in WPA2, which was responsible for securing modern wiﬁ.\nARP spooﬁng attack where\
    \ an attacker fakes the MAC ad-\ndress of the gateway and convinces the victims\
    \ to send frames\nto the fake address except the destination address. DNS spoof-\n\
    ing attacks where the trafﬁc is directed to the fake website\ncause altered DNS\
    \ records.\n[79],discussed UAV oriented CA and its consequences.\nUAV is an automated\
    \ aerial vehicle IoTA system used for\ncrop monitoring, pesticides or chemical\
    \ sprinkling, etc. The\nCA is integrity exploitation of UAV or IoTA devices. The\n\
    consequences of this attack can vandalize the whole stand-\ning crop in the ﬁeld,\
    \ ﬂood the crop, and sprinkle the pesti-\ncides in excess quantity. If such attacks\
    \ are widely coordi-\nnated, they can take the place of agro-terrorism. The authors\n\
    discussed other UAV based CA, such as radio frequency\njamming, malicious code\
    \ injection, MITM, DoS/DDOS, ran-\nsomware attacks, etc. These attacks can tamper/modify\
    \ the\ncommunication devices.\n[80], [81], [82] [49] discussed emerging CA aspects\
    \ in\nIoTA system on the different levels such as physical secu-\nrity of devices\
    \ due to the harsh nature of climate and nat-\nural disaster in IoTA, emerging\
    \ cyber threats like endpoint\nattacks, phishing, third party attack, supply chain\
    \ attacks,\nransomware, state-sponsored IoT attacks, threats in smart\ndevices.\
    \ They speciﬁed risks or dangers in terms of data\nbreaches, data integrity, privacy\
    \ breaches in business secrets,\nrisk of crypto-jacking, cyber-physical attacks,\
    \ state-sponsored\nattacks, highjacking, or threats to autonomous drones or trac-\n\
    tors.\n[83] described the several issues in IoTA caused by the\nInternet connectivity\
    \ for data processing and covered param-\neters based on CA in IoTA. In the IoTA\
    \ system, at the phys-\nical layer, the emerging CA such as unintentional physical\n\
    modiﬁcation in hardwired, temporary or permanent damage,\nautonomous system hijacking,\
    \ autonomous system disrup-\ntion, optical deformation, rough treatment, power\
    \ depletion\nof battery, sensor weakening as per the sensor aging, node\ncapturing,\
    \ adding a malicious node and sleep deprivation.\nIn sleep deprivation attack\
    \ there is draining the battery of\nthe smart devices. Network layer-based emerging\
    \ CA dis-\ncussed as DoS/DDoS, data transit attack, and routing attack.\nThe emerging\
    \ CA at the edge layer can be forged controls\nfor actuators, gateway-cloud request\
    \ forgery, forged mea-\nsure injection, booting, unauthorized access, MITM, signa-\n\
    ture wrapping, and ﬂooding. In the sequence, the concern-\ning CA in the application\
    \ layer is phishing, malicious script,\nDoS, and DDoS attacks. The author emphasized\
    \ the current\nstate of security in smart agriculture as the researcher and\n\
    developer leave default security features for the MQTT and\nCoAP since the researchers’\
    \ probability keeps it disabled.\nMoreover, IoT device manufacturers use IoTs\
    \ to keep them\ninvisible to the security feature, validation processes, col-\n\
    lecting, transferring, or storing phases or failure checks. This\npaper further\
    \ illustrates these invisible parameters for the in-\nvisible security features.\
    \ The authors also suggested a future\nenhancement in the perspective of better\
    \ security in smart\nagriculture and farming applications.\n[84] presented a literature\
    \ survey on CA pertaining to\ndistinct components of IoTA. They have discussed\
    \ attacks\nbased on hardwares like sensors, controllers, RFID tags. Few\nattacks\
    \ based on protocol such as RFID, NFC,bluetooth, wiﬁ,\nZigbee, 6loWPAN, and protocols\
    \ on application layer.\n[85], authors classiﬁed CA in IoTA based on the phys-\n\
    ical layer, network layer, middleware layer, and application\nlayer. The CA on\
    \ the physical layer is such a RF jamming,\nside-channel attack, which aims to\
    \ gather unauthorized in-\nformation regarding the implementation description\
    \ of the\nIoTA system using monitoring parameters of hardware like\nan electric\
    \ current or voltage [86]. Attacks on the network\nlayer are DoS, MITM, and cloud\
    \ computing attacks. At-\ntacks regarding data are data leakage, ransomware, cloud\n\
    data leakage, and misconﬁguration. Application layer based\nattacks are software\
    \ update based attacks such as malware\ninjection, buffer overﬂow and SQL injection.\
    \ Other attacks\nthey have covered are cyber terrorism and invalidation, which\n\
    refers to false data fabrication.\n[87], authors are concerned that exposure of\
    \ personnel’s\nprivate information, social engineering, cyber espionage, and\n\
    agroterrorism to any CA is a potentially severe threat that\nshould be seriously\
    \ and carefully considered.The possibil-\nity of cyber terrorism in the agriculture\
    \ sector is known as\nagroterrorism.\n[88], authors warn the cyber threat risk\
    \ in IoTA, for internet-\nbased automatic functional devices, like smart crop\
    \ sprayers,\ndrones, UAV in agriculture can be hacked.\n10\nCybercriminals are\
    \ looking to ruin the particular revenue\nbusiness, where agriculture plays a\
    \ very important role in\nrevenue generation for the individual and the country.\n\
    [89] homeland security of U.S. department mention the\nconcern potential cyber\
    \ threats and vulnerabilities in IoTA.\nTheir released report disscussed different\
    \ technologies in\nIoTA sucha as on farm device, location or remote sensing\n\
    technologies and machine learning. This report highlights\nhypothetical scenarios\
    \ pertaining to CACC. Likewise IoTA\nbased sensors could be the signaﬁcant cause\
    \ for CACC is-\nsues. A warning from the UK government and FBI states\nthat Cyber\
    \ criminals could exploit ﬂaws present in the IoTA\nhardware which were used to\
    \ plant and harvest crops, such\nas automatic crop sprayers, drones and robotic\
    \ harvesters\nto disrupt the GDP growth, food production of the country\n[90].\
    \ According to an FBI report, CA in IoTA has slowed\ndown the agriculture processing\
    \ system and also interrupted\nthe email communication and website-based administration.\n\
    A cyber crime by disrupting process dairy facilities can quickly\nspoil the result.\
    \ FBI has released a list of cybercrime in agri-\nculture. Where the means of\
    \ cybercrime was a ransomware\nattack, where data was stolen and encrypted, and\
    \ criminals\ndemanded ransom, cyber actors may perceive cooperatives\nas lucrative\
    \ targets with a willingness to pay due to the time-\nsensitive role in agricultural\
    \ production. The goal could be\nto disrupt the seed and fertilizer supplies.\n\
    Various IoT based CACC has been already observed and\nsevere consequences had\
    \ faced by users. [91], the Mirai bot-\nnet in 2016 is an example of DDoS attack\
    \ which was launched\non IoT devices in smart home on a large scale. Similar CA\n\
    are possible in the context of IOTA. The consequences of\nsuch attack can disrupt\
    \ normal functionality of distinct mod-\nules of an individual IoTA farm and leverage\
    \ for interrupt-\ning legitimate cyber services in other areas. [92], the IoTA\n\
    system can be compromised and controlled by utilising cen-\ntral malicious system\
    \ know as Botnet of Things. [93], a CA\nnamed as Night Dragon could steal big\
    \ amount of informa-\ntion from various petrochemical companies. [94], an another\n\
    incidence of devastation using phishing attack attemped on\nGerman steel mill\
    \ for gaining access on network plant pro-\nduction system of the mill ofﬁce.\n\
    The increase in CACC in IoT based devices has become\nthe concern in smart agriculture\
    \ where these CACC can bring\ndevastation to IoTA, crop demage, animal production\
    \ loss\nand vast ecconomical loss.\nIn 2020, JBS, one of the world’s biggest meat\
    \ processing\ncompanies, paid $11 million as a ransome to resolve a CA;\nmalware\
    \ attack that shut down Australian and New Zealand\nwool sales [95]. The US agriculture\
    \ ﬁrm AGCO was af-\nfected production by a ransomware attack. President Greg\n\
    Gatzke of ZAG Technical Services Inc observed losses be-\ntween $40,000 to $200,000\
    \ caused by cyber-criminals [96].\nIn the US, Jan 2021, faced the business lost\
    \ $9 million as cy-\nber criminals inﬁltrated a farm’s internal network via com-\n\
    promised administrative credentials. The total loss derives\nfrom the temporary\
    \ shutdown of operations.\nCo-founder of agricultural ﬁrm Muddy Machines, Chris\n\
    Chavasse, states that the IoTA based devices can be attacked\nand hacked. Their\
    \ study says that IoTA sector is at risk.\nIn industrial espionage, revenge-minded\
    \ employees can\ndamage farmers having a treaty in contract farming with that\n\
    particular company. In the case of IoTA, the farmer/contractor\nmay face severe\
    \ loss due to linked cyber security breaches or\nattacks on the contract provider\
    \ company. Subsequently, se-\nvere data loss/breaches or sabotage might be found\
    \ in IoTA.\nVarious emerging CACC, its consequences on IoTA and un-\nfavourable\
    \ affects on the farming are summarised in Table\n3.\nAgribusiness is suspected\
    \ of attacking and disturbing,\ndisrupting, or destroying its existing functional\
    \ system due\nto its fragility in nature, as IoTA is a hackable and crack-\nable\
    \ system. Consequently, various unsolved cases could be\nfound in the court of\
    \ law. Thus various challenges are being\nfaced in evidence collection and DF\
    \ investigation regarding\nIoTA. The various challenges are discussed in the next\
    \ sec-\ntion.\n7 Digital Forensics Challenges in IoTA\nDF is a superset of cyber\
    \ forensics, which includes forensics\nof all digital devices like computers,\
    \ mobile phones, PDAs,\npalmtops, storage devices, obscure devices like gaming\
    \ de-\nvices, recording devices, digital cameras, IoTs and many\nmore. DF consists\
    \ of the systematic propelled and scientif-\nically proven approach for preservation,\
    \ collection, valida-\ntion, identiﬁcation, analysis, interpretation, documentation\n\
    and presentation of digital evidence [100]. DF is a conven-\ntional technique\
    \ as the law enforcement acknowledges that\nmodern day life includes a distinct\
    \ of devices where IoT is at\nthe top of the list of digital devices. The IoT\
    \ can be exploited\nby criminal activity [101].\nThe IoTA is a subset of IoT.\
    \ It includes a sensor, gate-\nway, network, Internet and the cloud. Thus IoTA\
    \ also in-\nherits properties of DF challenges belong IoT. We have in-\ncluded\
    \ a few articles to discuss various DF challenges and\nissues in IoTA. According\
    \ to the principle of exchange given\nin 1934 by Dr. Edmond Locard (1877-1966),\
    \ \"Every action\nleaves a trace.\" Any action of a crime commiter cannot occur\n\
    without leaving a trace. The Locard’s principle was also de-\nﬁned in the perspective\
    \ of conventional crime that is proved\nin the digital world. The same rule is\
    \ equally applicable in\nthe IoTA.\n11\nTable 3: Emerging CACC and Its Consequences\

    \ into six categories: identiﬁcation, collection, preserva-\ntion, analysis, correlation,\
    \ attack attribution and presenta-\ntion. These challenges are further divided\
    \ into its subclasses.\nThe authors discussed DF challenges for various IoT appli-\n\
    cations except for IoTA.\nThe following section discusses the work done in the\n\
    area of IoT/IoTA forensics. In this article We have classi-\nﬁed related articles\
    \ into different categories, some of which\nare discussed below.\n7.1 Jurisdictions\n\
    [103] identiﬁed the challenge presented as the devices cross\nthe borderline of\
    \ jurisdictions. Likely, data in transit between\nIoTA devices and globally distributed\
    \ cloud computing plat-\nforms cross these borderlines more frequently. It is\
    \ unclear\nunder which law the case should be prosecuted i.e., the de-\nvice jurisdiction,\
    \ the attacker jurisdiction, or the data storage\njurisdiction. For this reason,\
    \ it is necessary to create an in-\nternational commission that updates the current\
    \ legislation\nand can deﬁne uniform procedures in IoT DF [102] [104].\nThe same\
    \ jurisdiction challenge stands for IoTA too.\nAccording to [105], DF is an interdisciplinary\
    \ process of\ninvestigation where cooperation and coordination between\nnations\
    \ is indeed required for transnational law enforcement.\nThe Council of Europe’s\
    \ Convention on Cybercrime formed\na committee, \"Council of Europe, 2001,\" for\
    \ harmonizing\nprocedural and substantive laws related to digital crime and\n\
    evidence among its signatories. The treaty commissions states\nto create standard\
    \ systems of substantive and procedural laws\nprohibiting cyber-criminal conduct\
    \ and investigating crimi-\nnal conduct with computer devices with respective\
    \ to each\ncountry. This treaty includes the number of signatories coun-\ntries\
    \ was 63; the few of 63 counties are USA, Canada, Ger-\nmany, France, Great Britain,\
    \ Italy, Hungary, Israel, Japan.\nThe other high technology nations have not signed\
    \ the treaty\nat the convention. That countries are like the Russian Feder-\n\
    ation, Peoples Republic of China, India, the Islamic Repub-\nlic of Iran, Mexico,\
    \ Pakistan and South Africa) [103].\n7.2 Search and Seizure\nSearch and seizure\
    \ is an essential step in any DF examina-\ntion. However, detecting the presence\
    \ of IoT evidences is\nquite challenging as the IoT devices are designed to work\n\
    passively and autonomously. In most cases, when an IoT de-\nvice is identiﬁed,\
    \ there is no documented method or reliable\ntool to collect residual pieces of\
    \ evidence from the device in\na forensically sound manner [106].\n[107] concerned\
    \ that the standards by which the evi-\ndence is in DF investigations could have\
    \ been altered to ac-\ncommodate the changing nature of the cloud computing en-\n\
    vironment. We believe that the alalogical statement holds for\nIoTA DF investigations\
    \ too. Beyond technical challenges,\nprivacy is a signiﬁcant issue to consider\
    \ when analyzing and\ncorrelating collected data, primarily as most IoT sensors\
    \ col-\nlect innate personal information [106].\n[108] authors reviewed various\
    \ DF limitations and chal-\nlenges in IoT. Those limitations include impracticability\
    \ of\ncloning of all data by a service provider, requirement of ex-\ncess time\
    \ in data acquisition and other challenges.\n7.3 Identiﬁcation\nIn the term of\
    \ IoT based DF investigation, the question arises\nof whether to investigate devices\
    \ or data in the case of cloud\nor else the devices may be viewed as a metadata\
    \ aspect of\nthe data or if the reverse is true, the cloud computing ar-\nchitectures\
    \ (PaaS, SaaS, IaaS) allow data fragmentation and\ndistribution among different\
    \ countries and continents [109].\nAs IoTA is one of the applications, IoT may\
    \ face the same\nchallenge in the identiﬁcation phase of the investigation.\n\
    7.4 Preservation\nIn evidence, the acquisition is to maintain the integrity of\n\
    the evidence collected. The most frequently used technique\nfor computers and\
    \ phones is calculating a hash to assure\nintegrity. The question arises about\
    \ calculating hash at the\ntime of creating an image. The problem here is the\
    \ lack of\navailable tools that can prevent accidental changes in the IoT\nbased\
    \ evidence [103].\n7.5 Challenge in imaging\nThe challenge of the acquisition\
    \ is to decide whether to cre-\nate an image of an endpoint or to acquire it physically.\
    \ In the\ncase of computer crimes, the standard practice is to create a\nworking\
    \ copy/image of the storage media and seal the actual\nmedia to avoid accidental\
    \ alteration in the actual evidence.\nSince the endpoints in IoT crime scenes,\
    \ excluding comput-\ners and smartphones, may store minimal or sometimes no\n\
    information, creating an image of those IoT nodes is com-\nplicated. If a component\
    \ stores some information, then it\nshould be technically possible to create an\
    \ image of that de-\nvice. The suggested way is to create images from available\n\
    sources [106].\n7.6 Analysis and correlation\nThe huge amount of data collected\
    \ in diverse type of IoT\ndevices makes it nearly impossible to provide an end\
    \ to end\n15\nanalysis of residual evidence. IoTA is a frequently evolv-\ning\
    \ technologies. Hence different Operating Systems (OS),\nvarious ﬁle formats and\
    \ distinct cryptographic methods. The\nExisting digital forensics tools or methodologies\
    \ do not sup-\nport for data extraction from emerging IoTA devices [102].\n7.7\
    \ Absence of Standard IoTA Architecture\nThe different standards for IoTA architecture\
    \ are followed\nby manufacturers, the lack of cooperation, and the many pe-\n\
    culiarities are the terrible thing about the IoT working within\nthe same area\
    \ of application. Due to the lack of standardiza-\ntion of IoTA architecture,\
    \ the smart irrigation system facil-\nitated by one manufacturer and the smart\
    \ crop monitoring\nsystem by another manufacturer can have problems in coor-\n\
    dination. The absence of a standard IoTA architecture chal-\nlenges the design\
    \ of the standard DF framework.\n7.8 Malware\nIn [97], the authors discussed various\
    \ research challenges in\nIoT forensics. The challenges are the complexity and\
    \ versa-\ntility of IoT devices, lack of standard IoT architecture, ev-\nidence\
    \ contamination due to overwriting data, and use of\nconventional tools forensics\
    \ tools.\n8 Discussion\nIoTA is the highest trending technology in human life\
    \ to\nmake life much easier, faster and more comfortable. Accord-\ning to Cisco\
    \ Internet Business Solution Group (IBSG), IoT\nwas born between 2008 - 2009,\
    \ with an average of 1.84 IoTs\nper person; the propositional logic can be derived\
    \ from this\nIBSG statistics that people will possess 10 IoTs per person\non an\
    \ average, in the coming age. Thus this ﬁeld requires\nthe most potential to research\
    \ in the IoTA domain to better\nits characteristics and work on its challenges.\n\
    This literature review is focused on IoTA. The rationale\nof this study is helpful\
    \ to understand IoTA architecture and\nits working environment from the physical\
    \ layer to the ap-\nplication layer from different authors’ perspectives. We have\n\
    included IoTA architecture, emerging CA, cyber crimes and\nDF investigation challenges\
    \ about IoT based Agriculture (IoTA).\nWe have done a comprehensive study about\
    \ the DF chal-\nlenges and issues that can have obstacles in this growing era\n\
    of IoTA and possible crime and related that scenario pre-\ncisely with IoTA. Many\
    \ challenges are discussed in previous\npapers. Those challenges include Jurisdiction\
    \ at IoT crime\nscenes, lack of available tools and documentation methods,\npreservation,\
    \ imaging, evidence analysis and correlation. There\ncan be future work on these\
    \ challenges, so the data must\nbe presentable in a court of law. In this review\
    \ work, we\nleft out elaborative discussion about all the IoTA based ap-\nplications,\
    \ deﬁnitions for IoT sensors, protocols, communi-\ncation technology, vulnerabilities,\
    \ cyber-attack, cybercrime,\ncybersecurity and DF, which can be added in the subsequent\n\
    study.\nThe concerning point of a literature review is that the\nauthors’ statement\
    \ was based on assumptions. The articles\nwere not found assured about CACC issues\
    \ in IoTA solu-\ntions. These weaknesses of the IoT system could be tested\nfor\
    \ being assured CACC. Consequently, the manufacturer\nand security experts would\
    \ have saved their time in ﬁnding\ncyber threats for each IoTA device with all\
    \ aspects through\nproactive measures.\nAs a part of the study, there has been\
    \ found a scarcity of\narticles on IoTA based cyber crime and DF discussion. Thus\n\
    the researchers can further explore emerging CACC and DF\ninvestigation based\
    \ on IoTA in this article to have survey\nbased insights. There must be readiness\
    \ for IoTA based CC\nand DF investigation process for running an agriculture busi-\n\
    ness (agribusiness) and to justice for the victim. The fail-\nure to prove the\
    \ suspect will cause the encourage CACC\nin IoTA. Those CACC will be responsible\
    \ for disturbing,\ndisrupting, or even destroying the IoTA system in agribusi-\n\
    ness. It will directly demotivate agribusiness persons to con-\ntribute to crop\
    \ and food production. Subsequently, individ-\nual agribusiness people, consumers,\
    \ laymen, countries and\nthe nation’s GDP could be affected. Thus there is an\
    \ urgent\nneed to have readiness towards CACC and DF in IoTA. It is\nalso observed\
    \ that most experiments were not conducted in\na practice environment and seemed\
    \ just an assumption. To\nsolve more real-time problems, researchers should also\
    \ ex-\nperiment with these techniques on real-world solutions for\nIoTA.\n9 Conclusion\n\
    It is a concerning point in SDG 2030; goal 2 is to promote\nsustainable agriculture\
    \ to achieve zero hunger. To smart agri-\nculture and farming the practice effectively,\
    \ IoTA is applied\nin almost all ﬁelds of agriculture, such as farm monitor-\n\
    ing, irrigation, pest monitoring, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, smart\
    \ poultry farm and so on. Existing smart\nfarming techniques are classiﬁed and\
    \ reviewed; from this\nstudy, it is understood that researchers should concentrate\n\
    more on readiness for emerging CACC for IoTA applica-\ntions or tools. The readiness\
    \ will provide non-interruptable\nservices. There is a need to be readiness for\
    \ DF investiga-\ntion for IoTA speciﬁcally which will make a robust judicial\n\
    system and strengthen the judicial system by catching the\nnatural suspected person.\n\

    \ With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources\
    \ of data generation have increased\nexponentially. The use and processing of\
    \ this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The\
    \ concept\nof a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making\
    \ in the various aspects of daily life and also\nimprovement in the traditional\
    \ systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include\
    \ devices used for\ndata collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis,\
    \ and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital\n\
    role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many\
    \ challenges when dealing with such voluminous\nand high-speed generated data,\
    \ such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time\
    \ responses, and so on.\nProbabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved\
    \ as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this\n\
    tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used in\
    \ many smart city domains, including healthcare,\ntransportation, the environment,\
    \ energy, and industry. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review\
    \ of PDS and its\napplications in the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain\
    \ of the smart city has been explored in detail; origin, current\nresearch status,\
    \ challenges, and existing application of PDS along with research gaps and future\
    \ directions. The foremost aim of\nthis paper is to provide a detailed survey\
    \ of PDS in smart cities; for readers and researchers who want to explore this\
    \ ﬁeld; along\nwith the research opportunities in the domains.\nKeywords: Smart\

    \ in the ﬁeld of computing and data was the new term. There was\nan evolution\
    \ of relational databases between the 1980s and 1990s. The internet and IoT are\
    \ clusters of unstructured,\nsemi-structured, and structured data. In the 1990s,\
    \ there was slow or no internet in most cities. These were ordinary\ncities. Generally,\
    \ ordinary cities are deﬁned as human settlements without the use of the latest\
    \ technology at all.\nThe need for processing, storage, and analysis is required\
    \ beyond the human and technical infrastructure. This huge\nvolume and variety\
    \ of unstructured data and untapped information is spread across the networks.\
    \ The core part of\nApache Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),\
    \ consisting of the storage part, and the MapReduce\n*Corresponding author. E-mails:\

    \ [4]. As the data is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwell-structured manner, the government and public sector require technologies\
    \ and expertise to convert urban cities\nto smart cities. The research interest\
    \ in smart cities has continuously increased in the current and coming years and\n\
    it is economically justiﬁed by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21].\
    \ New inventions like the internet, the\ncloud, and IoT have increased data generation\
    \ speed as well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts\ntowns\
    \ and cities around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of\
    \ new technologies. But in the\ncurrent context, rapid population growth is creating\
    \ challenges for the government and its services. So, smart cities\nare the most\
    \ acceptable solution to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions\
    \ [146]. The emergence of\na smart city has the potential to manage all these\
    \ issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious urbanization also quickly presents\na major\
    \ challenge worldwide. Though movement from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable,\
    \ that’s why cities\npersist in facing many challenges like transport, healthiness,\
    \ air quality, agriculture, and many more [87]. Smart\ncities face many issues\
    \ like pollution, health assistance, overburden on both public and private sectors,\
    \ trafﬁc, etc.\ndue to the rapid growth in population in metropolitan cities [126].\
    \ In this connection, the problems associated with\nthese issues in cities require\
    \ ingenious solutions. They include human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration\
    \ with\ndifferent stakeholders [117].\nIn a recent survey, the United Nations\
    \ estimated that the world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to\n2050 and\
    \ that the population will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers\
    \ also stated that by\n2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in\
    \ cities, with the southeast United States experiencing the\ngreatest growth [74,275].\
    \ The extensive and rapid growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\
    has provided possible solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan\
    \ areas [13] this approach can\nbe used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness\
    \ of the city system. In this regard, the thinking or mentality of\nhumans is\
    \ required to be changed, like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for\
    \ sustainability in the smart\ncity. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management\
    \ systems are being used to improve energy efﬁciency in smart\ncities [316].\n\
    Since the advent of the coronavirus and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic,\
    \ all public and private sectors have\nbeen affected. This virus has affected\
    \ daily routines and activities like education, communication, daily movement,\n\
    labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors have worked with 50% manpower\
    \ on alternative days. Many\nsectors, like IT companies, schools, etc. have run\
    \ Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n231\ndiagnosed online.\
    \ The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life can be solved\
    \ through the smart\ncity. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to help society\
    \ and expand the resources available to individuals in areas\nsuch as healthcare,\
    \ communication, transportation, education, and many others.\nThe Government of\
    \ India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI deﬁnes smart cities\
    \ as a mission\nto conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by\
    \ allowing the development of regional zones and\nutilizing technology that directs\
    \ to smart results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings\n\
    from the Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities\
    \ plan their smart city journeys. Creating\na smart city incorporates lessons\
    \ from the smart city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works.\n\
    Consolidated at the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake\
    \ 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018\ncrores in 5 years from their selected dates.\
    \ New ﬁnancial innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution\nis\
    \ estimated to be from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs.\
    \ 185,905 Cr are tendered, 5845\nprojects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order\
    \ stages and 3145 projects worth Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The\ncities like\
    \ Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna, Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar,\
    \ and Ahmedabad are\ncovered under various smart city projects [183].\n1.1. Role\
    \ of big data in smart city\nBig Data basically stands for velocity, volume, and\
    \ variety of information, which includes complexity in terms\nof speed of data\
    \ generation, the structure of data (variety), and the amount of data to be generated.\
    \ Big data has\na number of deﬁnitions and’V’ principles to make big data processing\
    \ clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond\nthe human and traditional infrastructure\
    \ and techniques required to store, process, and analyze big data provides\nthe\
    \ solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, ICT, sensors,\
    \ and so on, big data systems are\nbecoming more efﬁcient in sophisticated data\
    \ infrastructures [170].\nThe role of big data in smart cities is heavily inﬂuenced,\
    \ particularly in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and\nprocessing data collected\
    \ from various IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart\
    \ city. These\ncities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree\
    \ and basic lifestyle. To extract important information\nfrom such huge data sets,\
    \ big data analysis is the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors\
    \ and devices in\na smart city’s various gates installed in the city is used for\
    \ better decisions. This growth in data requires efﬁcient\nstorage and handling,\
    \ which is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different\
    \ effects in\ndifferent parts of the city.\nThe protection of the general public:\
    \ The security and privacy of citizens is the main concern in smart cities.\n\
    To protect their citizens from anything mishappening within the city, various\
    \ analyses of geographical data can be\ndone. This can all be recorded through\
    \ Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and sensors installed on street lights or\n\
    trafﬁc lights. An enormous amount of data is developed and signiﬁcant expansion\
    \ is required when the desired data\ntransforms the city into a considerably safer\
    \ location.\nUrbanism: Cities are investing heavily in transforming to become\
    \ smart cities. The current needs of the city\ncan be identiﬁed through the effective\
    \ use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require development and\n\
    improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in areas where they\
    \ are needed.\nFig. 2. Inﬂuence of big data in smart cities.\n232\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nTransportation: After\
    \ Covid-19 both public and private transportation are affected after COVID-19.\
    \ Most people\nrely on their own reasoning to get to work and so on. The congestion\
    \ on the roads is increasing, so the risk of\naccidents or anything else going\
    \ wrong has also increased. To handle or manage trafﬁc on roads, the system requires\n\
    big data and well-structured data. Large data sets will also help reduce risks.\n\
    Sustainable Growth: This is also the main part of a smart city. For sustainable\
    \ growth, a huge amount of past and\npresent data is required. Likewise, storing\
    \ this data is one of the challenges for the smart city. This data is updated\n\
    on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in determining the impact of improvement\
    \ in the city.\nInfrastructure: To maintain sustainability, smart city infrastructure\
    \ needs to improve consistently. Obviously, for\nthis data, a smart city is required\
    \ and used in a good manner to improve or maintain the infrastructure.\nSo, the\
    \ role of big data in smart cities is signiﬁcant for efﬁcient and quick results.\
    \ Big data is the brain of the\nsmart city. The main challenge is the lack of\
    \ awareness of using this data to create smart solutions to fulﬁll the\nrequirements\
    \ of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of smart cities. So, to improve\
    \ the standard of living,\nthe developer needs new data processing tools and techniques.\
    \ There is computational, time, and space complexity\nby using the deterministic\
    \ data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one of the key solutions for\
    \ smart storage\nand searching of data in real-time scenarios.\nThe traditional\
    \ methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off\
    \ in space and time,\nwhich is not acceptable due to the massive amount of data.\
    \ Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional\ndata structure is\
    \ shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,\
    \ which may be\nor may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.\
    \ Since PDSs have some probabilistic compo-\nnents, they are efﬁcient in reducing\
    \ the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,\n\
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate\
    \ predictions. Hash functions are used\nto represent these data structures [246].\
    \ The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\ntesting,\
    \ and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are\
    \ two distinct features of\nPDS [136].\nThe extensive review of this paper has\
    \ found the key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart\ncities.\
    \ In this regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to\
    \ these challenges and also found new\npossibilities. In this paper, the importance\
    \ of big data in smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4),\n\
    and the detailed application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart\
    \ city projects (Section 5) and\ncommonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed.\
    \ During the survey, it was found that big data has a high\ninﬂuence on smart\
    \ cities. PDS has evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart\
    \ cities to complete\nthis tedious task of handling big data with real-time response.\
    \ PDS has been used in many smart city domains,\nincluding healthcare, transportation,\
    \ the environment, energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated\n\
    the prominent domain of smart cities, including the origin, current research status,\
    \ and existing applications of PDS,\nas well as research gaps and challenges (Section\
    \ 10).\n2. Generations of smart cities\nTo improve the standard of living there\
    \ is a need to change from rural to urban. Governments and citizens are\nincreasing\
    \ their attention in terms of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The\
    \ concept of a smart city for\nurban transformation has radically changed over\
    \ the years. The generation of smart cities has been concise (Table 1).\nBased\
    \ on analysis and study, several researchers have divided the technical advancement\
    \ in smart cities into different\ngenerations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]:\n\
    Generations 1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own\
    \ solutions in cities, it was deﬁned\nas the ﬁrst technology-driven smart city.\
    \ Due to the inﬂuential role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they\nare\
    \ criticized for their technology concerns. To improve the efﬁciency of public\
    \ and private services, the creators of\ntechnology development are encouraged\
    \ to use their own solutions in cities.\nGenerations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned\
    \ with citizens, issues like healthcare, transport, air quality, and water qual-\n\
    ity are arising. The technology and tools were developed to address such issues\
    \ in generation 2.0. The participation\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    \ in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life and local administration\
    \ was mea-\nsured by modern technology. For this, cities presented agendas and\
    \ schemes that support the execution of trendy\ntechnology.\nGenerations 3.0:\
    \ – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates\
    \ ICT into a\nsmart city. The modern city building programs were organized and\
    \ the local public participated. It was the time\nwhen the government acted as\
    \ a facility providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent\
    \ to represent\ntheir thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban\
    \ space is designed for users and their engagement.\nGenerations 4.0: – By adopting\
    \ 4.0 industrial transformation, the beneﬁts of smart cities are valued to outweigh\n\
    city costs through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates\
    \ the most useful parts of the\npast; for example, technology generation 1.0,\

    \ is over the use\nof existing resources and infrastructure.\nGenerations 5.0:\
    \ – In this generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for\
    \ developing cities.\nIt is purely based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Systems\
    \ are self-learned from past and present knowledge that\nreﬂects changes in real-time\
    \ like interest, barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled\
    \ by an\nindependent agent, which gives fast and efﬁcient results. Generations\
    \ 5.0 is the main focus on decision-making for\nurban development by using behavioral\
    \ analysis and AI [264].\n3. Ranking of smart city\nWorldwide, there are different\
    \ ranking systems based on distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular\
    \ are,\n“Liveable City Index (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable\
    \ cities” [28], “global cities” and “competi-\ntiveness cities” [266].\nThe center\
    \ smart city index is used for ranking by researchers’ organizations such as Smart\
    \ City Observatory, in\ncollaboration with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities like transportation, trafﬁc,\nstreet light\
    \ etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al.\
    \ [266] tries to identify\nthe preferences of people living with different city\
    \ ranking systems, and the top ﬁve cities in the last three years are\ngiven in\
    \ Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper Research, an analyst ﬁrm based\
    \ in the UK, has ranked the\ncities as smart cities on various factors like transportation,\
    \ energy, healthcare, connectivity between urban areas, etc.\nShanghai, Seoul,\
    \ Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among the top ﬁve global cities considered.\
    \ These cities\nmainly work on real-time data, which helps in managing the assets\
    \ and future-prooﬁng them. They also cover the\ndowntown to provide 5G and 99%\
    \ of ﬁber coverage across the city. To fully ﬁll, the needs of residents, these\
    \ smart\ncities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”, which uses ambient technologies\
    \ like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data,\nwhich come under Smart City Generation\
    \ 5.0 [20].\n4. Architecture of smart city\nSmart city development includes the\
    \ integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential\n\
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application\
    \ management. The number of smart\ncity architectures proposed over time [226].\
    \ In Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four\nlayers.\
    \ All these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive\
    \ data.\nSensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents\
    \ the sensing layer or data collection layer.\nIoT devices are used to build this\
    \ layer. This layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity,\
    \ temperature, pressure, etc. Data\ncollection on mobile devices is a huge burden\
    \ on the sensor layer, which resides under the structure. This layer\ncaptures\
    \ real-time data from sensors [26,192].\nTransmission layer: – With a variety\
    \ of communication technologies, the transfer layer carries data to higher\nlevels.\
    \ This layer acts as the spine of any smart city architecture. In this layer,\
    \ the various communication networks\nlike 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite\
    \ also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication\nis embedded\
    \ in the base station for transferring huge wireless trafﬁc [100].\nData management\
    \ layer: – This layer resides between the transmission and application layers\
    \ and is the brain of\na smart city. The functions of this layer are deception,\
    \ editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n235\nFig. 4. Layered architecture\
    \ of a generic smart city [243].\nstored information in this layer is used to\
    \ provide services to various applications in the top layer. The primary role\n\
    of this layer is to preserve data integrity, data puriﬁcation, expansion, and\
    \ optimization [285]. As the ﬁnal function\nof the data management layer, the\
    \ conclusions obtained are transferred to the application layer for proper use.\n\
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management\
    \ layer with urban residents.\nThis is the topmost layer of this architecture.\
    \ This layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications\nthat\
    \ use IoT, for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather\
    \ forecasting, etc., and intelligent\nhealth [317]. As this layer is directly\
    \ connected to the end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the\n\
    improvement of services provided.\n5. Projects contributions related to smart\
    \ city\nThe research on smart city buildings has been accomplished worldwide.\
    \ Hence, the concept of smart cities was\nintroduced. The research was conducted\
    \ by various international organizations, universities, and businesses. Various\n\
    countries, like the US and China, have also accomplished research in intelligent\
    \ urban design [156]. The smart city\nencourages the planning of metropolitan,\
    \ oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation method proposed\nby\
    \ IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards. So far, the\
    \ various initiatives, contributions,\nachievements, and projects in smart cities\
    \ are listed in Table 3 [106].\n6. Probabilistic data structure\nThe exponential\
    \ increase in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due\
    \ to the emergence\nof ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce\
    \ accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off in\nspace and time,\
    \ which is not acceptable for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless\
    \ evolution, the\ntraditional data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and\
    \ storage. PDS has given an approximation solution, which\nmay be or may not be\
    \ the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction. Since PDSs have some\
    \ probabilistic\ncomponents, they are efﬁcient in reducing the time or space trade-offs.\
    \ PDS also plays a key role in big data\nprocessing, storing nonstructural data,\
    \ helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate predictions. In general,\n\

    \ are widely\nused by various researchers in their design and development. These\
    \ are very useful for handling and storing large\namounts of data in an appropriate\
    \ and efﬁcient manner. Hash functions are used to represent these data structures\n\
    [246]. The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\
    \ testing, and cardinal counting. Low\nmemory requirements and good processing\
    \ speed are two distinct features of PDS [136].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n237\nFig. 5. Overview of PDS [246].\n6.1. Bloom\
    \ ﬁlter\nIn 1970, the concept of Bloom Filter (BF) was introduced by Burton H.\
    \ Bloom [36]. The BF is a probabilistic\nmodel, a highly efﬁcient random data\
    \ structure. It is used to reduce space problems and is an effective way to query\n\
    the membership of any item in an extensive set. The BF consists of an array with\
    \ m-bits which is initialized to 0 and\nk hash functions. The hash function k\
    \ is used to query an element. To ﬁnd the position of elements in the array, put\n\
    them into the k hash functions.\nFor insertion into BF, the ﬁrst element has been\
    \ added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,\nhash functions\
    \ are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index. In the query\
    \ process, an element is\nchecked to see whether it is a member of the set or\
    \ not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the\nbits are\
    \ set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then\
    \ the answer is “deﬁnitely not”.\nProperties of BF:\n– It is impossible to false\
    \ negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is\
    \ possible (in\nstandard BF).\n– To process an element, the query time is O (k),\
    \ where k is the hash function.\n– The size of the union and intersection of BF\
    \ is the same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise\nOR and\
    \ AND are used.\nFig. 6. Insertion in bloom ﬁlter [246].\n6.2. Count min sketch\n\
    Count-min sketch (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003\
    \ [64]. It is a streaming algo-\nrithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244].\
    \ Its functionality is also hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different\nfrom\
    \ BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional array to handle a given data set, while\
    \ BF uses a 1-dimensional array\nfor representing hashed data.\n238\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 7. Count min\
    \ sketch [246].\nThe basic data structure of CMS consists of a 2-D array (d *\
    \ w) where w is used for storing the counts and it\ndepends on the maximum outputs\
    \ given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1 . . . d) and it is pairwise\n\
    independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions with the d-hash\
    \ functions. The values determined\nby the hash function are used to get the actual\
    \ occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined\nvalues by\
    \ the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The space used\
    \ by CMS is equal to the count\nof (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate\
    \ values of d and w, we get efﬁcient results with very few errors.\nUse more hash\
    \ functions for more accurate results.\nProperties of Count-Min sketch:\n– It\
    \ supports union operations on cells.\n– The query time to process is O (k), where\
    \ k is a hash function.\n– The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple\
    \ times, with a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters.\n– CMS also has various\
    \ applications like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking,\
    \ etc.\n6.3. Locality sensitive hashing\nIn 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced\
    \ the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle\nof using\
    \ low-dimensional space for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected\
    \ very carefully, which\nhas more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The\
    \ LSH has three phases. These are: the ﬁrst phase is the\npreprocessing phase\
    \ where different measures are used for mapping data, in the second phase, hash\
    \ tables are\ncreated, and in the ﬁnal phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing\
    \ identical items (Fig. 8). The similar items\nare located in the same bucket,\
    \ so the whole data is located in buckets [104].\nFig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing\
    \ framework [246].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n239\nA LSH family lshF() is deﬁned with probabilities P1 and P2, an approximation\
    \ factor c ⩾ 1, a threshold R ⩾ 0,\nand for a metric space M = (M, d). This function\
    \ lshF() maps the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions\nh: M →\
    \ S [287]. The following conditions must be satisﬁed for p, qϵM and hash function\
    \ h chosen uniformly at\nrandom from F :\n– if d(p, q) ⩽ R, then h(p) = h(q) (i.e.,\
    \ p and q collide) with probability at least P1,\n– if d(p, q) ⩾ cR, then h(p)\
    \ = h(q) with probability at most P2.\nA family is interesting when P1 ⩾ P2. Such\
    \ a family lshF() is called (R, cR, P1, P2)-sensitive.\nProperties of Locality\
    \ Sensitive Hashing:\n– The same items are hashed to the same buckets as different\
    \ items, so LSH hashes the items a number of times.\n– Cosine, similarity, and\
    \ hammering distances are examples of item LSH functions.\n– The functions of\
    \ LSH are not limited to the same standard measures commonly used for data retrieval,\
    \ overlap,\nand dice coefﬁcient [54].\n6.4. Quotient ﬁlter\nMichael Bender et\
    \ al. proposed a quotient ﬁlter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It uses less memory to sample\
    \ an element that\nis a member or not of the set. Basically, it has performed\
    \ four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member\non the set. QF uses\
    \ the single hash function for ﬁngerprint generation with a size of p (in bits).\
    \ For insertion of\nelement in QF, remainder fr ← (fp(x) mod 2r) and quotient\
    \ fp ← (⌊fp(x)2r⌋) are calculated, where fp is the\nindex of bucket and fr is\
    \ value inserted in fp bucket. QF gives the speciﬁc result to the query that is\
    \ either probably\nyes or deﬁnitely not the element of the set. There is some\
    \ probability after querying that the element is in the set, but\nactually, it\
    \ is not present (Fig. 9). The storage size is decreased with the increase of\
    \ ﬁlter size, so there is a trade-off\nbetween storage and false-positive [82].\n\
    Properties of Quotient Filter:\n– An Approximate Member Query (AMQ) ﬁlter is used\
    \ to speed up the answers in the storage system.\n– Insertion, deletion, and updating\
    \ are allowed in QF, resulting in the large usage of proxy databases.\n– There\
    \ is no need to re-hash the original key for merging and re-sizing of QF.\nPDSs\
    \ are used in many real-time applications like preserving patient data in healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc control, energy-\nsaving, and also for SEM and SAM, and many more. In\
    \ the next section, the PDS and their applications in smart\ncities and big data\
    \ will be explored in a more detailed manner.\nFig. 9. Quotient ﬁlter [89].\n\

    \ city application\nThe smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, street lights. Intelligent technologies\nlike ICT, IoT, sensors etc.\
    \ and analysis of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard\
    \ of life.\nThe important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare,\
    \ smart trafﬁc management system, smart\nemergency system, smart street light,\
    \ a virtual power plant in smart grid etc.\nPeoples have a number of reasons like\
    \ job opportunities, education, and many more to move from one city to\nanother\
    \ even in an epidemic like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed\
    \ through IoT devices like\nsensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data\
    \ is used to improve social services, infrastructure, and decision-\nmaking. This\
    \ information plays an essential role in real-time application and services in\
    \ urban areas [202].\nFig. 10. Applications of smart city.\n7.1. Smart healthcare\n\
    Healthcare is an important service to the growth and development of any smart\
    \ city. In recent years, smart health-\ncare has emerged with the growth of ICT.\
    \ It is a process of managing one’s health by a couple of doctors themselves\n\
    or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system needs to be transformed into\
    \ smart healthcare in order to become\nmore efﬁcient and convenient for patients.\
    \ With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT, AI etc. the healthcare\nindustry\
    \ have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction between doctor-patient\
    \ to new i.e. remote health mon-\nitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky, NY, USA) came up\
    \ with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some\nchallenges\
    \ while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems, equipment\
    \ are under enormous\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in\
    \ smart city\n241\npressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially, inform\
    \ decision-making process with detailed information, ad-\nditional wisdom for\
    \ nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients\
    \ run from\none department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision\
    \ diagnostics, and right measurements. With the\nincrease of population, these\
    \ challenges are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance\
    \ of\nindustrialized nations is facing vital difﬁculties regarding the quality\
    \ and cost of numerous healthcare and wellbeing\nservices [3]. Due to limited\
    \ resources, some cities are deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of\
    \ this, there is\na need for new systems, smart healthcare. In the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ healthcare, devices, the internet, and IoT can connect\npeople with each other,\
    \ as well as manage healthcare activities and resources. Smart healthcare is one\
    \ of the highest\nlevels of knowledge building in the medical ﬁeld [108]. To collect\
    \ information dynamically, liking between insti-\ntutions and healthcare, smart\
    \ healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced technologies, devices like\
    \ wearable,\nmobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare can reduce workload\
    \ at the information desk, and also Help patients\nand their wards.\n7.1.1. Evolution\
    \ of healthcare\nVarious authors and researchers in their studies are categories\
    \ the healthcare system in different generations\n(Fig. 11) (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare\
    \ 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare system are discussed\n\
    as:\nHealthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the ﬁrst evolution ‘Healthcare\
    \ 1.0’ was introduced. Due to\nlimited digital resources, it was restricted to\
    \ paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the efﬁciency\nof health\
    \ services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed the home remedy\
    \ system and the\nuntrained physicians who provide paternal care into a more sophisticated,\
    \ intelligent, and data-driven system that\ncan be called the “medical complex”.\
    \ In the 1830s the British government start piping the water to homes, when\n\
    the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171]. Shortly thereafter,\
    \ the scientiﬁc vaccine theory\nwas established [48]. In the 19th century, a better\
    \ environment for healthy living integrated measures for sanitation,\ninfection\
    \ control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been created.\nHealthcare\
    \ 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0 was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to\
    \ combine with digital\ntechnology. Industrial machinery kept working and changing.\
    \ In the 20th century to increase the productivity of\ncheap products, the automobile\
    \ industry introduces the concept of mass production [120]. The healthcare system\n\
    also follows the same. At the end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical\
    \ companies were formed [214]. A few\nyears later various antibiotics were introduced,\
    \ with the advent of mass-industrial manufacturing technology [299].\nAlso at\
    \ that time in medical education importance was given to both clinical training\
    \ and basic science education\n[93]. Hospitals are expanding, being provided by\
    \ more specialists, and doctors are being trained to deal with more\npatients\
    \ with complex conditions. The main focus is on building a part of healthcare\
    \ 2.0 [58]. The second version of\nhealthcare is aimed at improving productivity\
    \ and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited to\nwithin\
    \ the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The new version\
    \ is entrenched in response\nto the symptoms, illness, and needs of the individual.\
    \ Information was shared with other organizations with privacy\nand security.\
    \ It was electrical energy-oriented.\nHealthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare\
    \ 3.0 was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs)\
    \ were introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud\
    \ gateway. It was a step\ntowards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication\
    \ and information communication technology\n(TICT), which provides database enhancement\
    \ and additional data efﬁciency to prevent medical-related problems\n[1]. The\
    \ advent of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small\
    \ computers and fast-tracking\nenvironments, as well as large data storage [127,255].\
    \ With advanced computer technology, tomography jumped\nfrom single images to\
    \ redesigned images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and\
    \ diagnose\ndiseases earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after\
    \ diagnosis disease [85]. They have additional\ninformation gathered from e-libraries\
    \ using fast computer technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emer-\n\
    gency care and was able to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness\
    \ or symptoms of the disease. Internet\nchanges learning because much medical\
    \ literature is available at e-libraries. In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to\n\
    use technologies like BDA and IoT-based wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical\
    \ record databases.\nHealthcare 4.0: – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric healthcare\nservices with the advent\
    \ of new technologies and IoT devices [261]. This healthcare evolution is inspired\
    \ by ‘In-\n242\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\nFig. 11. Health generation.\ndustry 4.0’ by establishing personalized\
    \ healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on\n\
    smart devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL,\
    \ AI, and IoT for the detection of\ndiseases, [151]. It is the successive approach\
    \ of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their\n\
    websites and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient\
    \ records are shared with healthcare\nprofessionals via an e-Health record over\
    \ the cloud or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers\ncan be\
    \ connected. It helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also\
    \ communicate with fellow doc-\ntors for better treatment. However, data sharing\
    \ has introduced new challenges such as authentication, security, and\nauthority,\
    \ and so on, [280]. New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories,\
    \ wearable devices,\nand 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efﬁciently;\
    \ illnesses can be quickly diagnosed using a drop of\nblood; custom-designed surgery\
    \ of body joints can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D\n\
    printing [280]. Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery,\
    \ CC, CPS, information security, and\nmany more.\nHealthcare 5.0: – The era of\
    \ healthcare 5.0 began in 2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features\n\
    such as a robot nurse, a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With\
    \ latency (10–100 ms) and reliability\n(99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high\
    \ accuracy for remote connections [314], 6G communication addresses\nreliability\
    \ and latency issues in smart cities. Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall\
    \ short of meeting future\ndemands for big data connections such as holographic\
    \ communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing), games, and\ntelesurgery. This\
    \ evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine\
    \ commu-\nnication. The human-machine cooperation and participation improve the\
    \ diagnosis system and fast results. This\nsystem is more secure than its predecessors.\
    \ A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications that auto-\nmatically\
    \ collects data and removes unreliable systems from external companies. The system\
    \ is not dependent on a\nsingle-point failure due to a decentralized network [150].\n\
    The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in Table 4.\nM.\

    \ in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,\npatients, and doctors.\
    \ Smart healthcare has many beneﬁts, like disease prevention and monitoring, diagnosis\
    \ and\ntreatment, hospital management, health decision-making, and medical research.\
    \ ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data,\nand modern biotechnology are the foundations\
    \ of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors use\nLaboratory\
    \ Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for managing health\
    \ data [207].\n7.1.2. Challenges in smart healthcare\nTrusted Communication: –\
    \ Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when\
    \ real-\ntime data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections\
    \ on mobile devices such as wearable devices\nwhile moving anywhere a patient\
    \ walks, crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching\n\
    the network to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation.\
    \ The different amounts of data are\ngenerated while switching to the network,\
    \ which is dependent on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider\nand\
    \ the location of the feed. As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity,\
    \ we should also adjust the\nnetwork type and location to the value, speed, audio,\
    \ and video required by our device.\nCyber security: – Cyber security is one of\
    \ the challenges when we talk about smart healthcare. As it requires\ninternet\
    \ access and IoT devices, the data may be stolen or attackers may attack data\
    \ or modify the data. So the ﬁrst\npriority of the healthcare system is to ensure\
    \ the privacy of patients and their data. There are some private IoT-based\nnetworks\
    \ (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol) that are available, which create private\
    \ areas only accessible by\nauthorized users or devices.\nScalable Platforms:\
    \ – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare system, a scalable platform is\
    \ required. For\nthe effectiveness of a smart healthcare system to be enhanced,\
    \ it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with\npatients and their big\
    \ data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients use the devices\
    \ and system\neasily for monitoring remotely.\nCost: – Meet, the requirements\
    \ of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may\
    \ take\nless time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require\
    \ new tools and techniques for efﬁcient\nstorage and retrieval.\n244\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nData Availability:\
    \ – The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and\
    \ device identiﬁ-\ncation. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent\
    \ data. So it requires identifying the resources\nand storage management with\
    \ new technologies in healthcare systems.\nData Security: – While accessing the\
    \ data, it is mandatory that only the authorized user can access the concerned\n\
    data. It still needs to be improved.\nUnique Identiﬁcation: – In the healthcare\
    \ system, it is required to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and\nvice\
    \ versa. This is required for providing or getting the best and correct treatment.\n\
    Privacy Issue: – This is one of the major issues while we are talking about big\
    \ data and IoT devices in a smart\ncity. Many kinds of research provide many tools\
    \ and techniques. But still, it needs to be improved.\nDevice Communication: –\
    \ Machine to machine, a device to machine, and human to machine communication\
    \ is\nchallenging. Patients need a quick response to their records, medical tests,\
    \ and medical reports. A 5G/6G network\nis required for the smooth transformation\
    \ of data communication. It is cost-effective, and also required some tools\n\
    and algorithms for privacy and data exchanges.\nData Integrity: – Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of healthcare data is also challenging because it is important for\
    \ providers\nto use it in making decisions about patient care. It is also required\
    \ for information exchange between doctors and\npatients.\n7.1.3. Application\
    \ of PDS in smart healthcare\nDue to the rapid growth in the population and an\
    \ epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and overcrowded. Patients\nare struggling\
    \ to ﬁnd the doctor’s ofﬁce and pre-body check-up center. Patients and their guardians\
    \ also face the\nissue of understanding medical terms, and they need someone’s\
    \ help to get the proper information. For that, a\nproper healthcare system is\
    \ required with the use of new technologies like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one\
    \ hand, the\nIoT has beneﬁted patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance\
    \ companies. On the other hand, challenges\nhave increased. Because sensors and\
    \ IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle this data, the following\n\
    is the application of PDS which may be used in smart healthcare systems:\nData\
    \ Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous or heterogeneous,\
    \ semi-structured or unstruc-\ntured, which will result in the trafﬁc load on\
    \ switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the perfor-\nmance\
    \ of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based\
    \ Secure rule-space\nmanagement’ is proposed for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\
    \ [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash\nfunctions for security checks\
    \ and also manages the network resources to handle the trafﬁc in data. Smart healthcare\n\
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.\
    \ The security of this data is in dan-\nger. The data security features are improved\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems.\nBF is\
    \ also useful in data transmission elimination [300].\nData Sharing: – The Garbled\
    \ Bloom ﬁlter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing\
    \ for\nmultiple users [260] in the Veriﬁable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).\
    \ This scheme supports single-\nkeyword search. The author also compares his programme\
    \ with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This\nscheme helps in\
    \ doctor-patient data sharing. The multi-keyword search veriﬁcation mechanism\
    \ is introduced based\non pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare\
    \ data systems [283]. The mechanism also takes care\nof authentication and advanced\
    \ encryption with advanced privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional\n\
    calculation protocol, to compare a unit of characters and record [277].\nData\
    \ Security and Privacy-Preserving System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays\
    \ a big role in smart healthcare.\nA huge amount of data is exchanged between\
    \ machines, humans, and devices. This big data can be encrypted and\nthen stored\
    \ on a cloud so that only authenticated users can access it. There are also privacy\
    \ issues. A scheme for\nefﬁciently sharing data is proposed to address this issue.\
    \ The author uses attribute-based encryption with attribute BF\nto control access.\
    \ While transforming data or sharing sensitive information, a lot of privacy concerns\
    \ may arise. Xu\net al. propose a scheme using BF, which is privacy-preserving\
    \ for patient health information for sharing information\n[293]. The author uses\
    \ an encrypted search method that allows numerical search for encrypted data.\
    \ The BF and\nmessage veriﬁcation code are used to ﬁlter patient data and check\
    \ the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design\ncooperative privacy preservation\
    \ for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for controlling\
    \ data\naccess in the context of space and time information [162]. In space-aware,\
    \ they use MinHash-based authentication,\nand in time-aware, attribute-based encryption\
    \ is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n245\nFig. 12. Status\
    \ ledger’s block size with and without using BF. [11].\ndata in storage without\
    \ exposing secret information, and for secure data interaction, positive and negative\
    \ ﬁlters\nare used. Seham A., et al. [11] introduce a system for infection control\
    \ with the use of Blockchain for privacy-\npreserving. In this system, one leader\
    \ elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected users and the other\n\
    for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and suspected users, which\
    \ reduces the storage space. The\nblock size of the COVID-19 status ledger with\
    \ and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12).\nFast Response and Congestion\
    \ control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like trafﬁc lights,\n\
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource\
    \ sharing and effective communication,\nall devices with different conﬁgurations\
    \ have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of\nthese\
    \ devices, the trafﬁc in the network also increases, causing difﬁculty in predicting\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. G. S. Aujla\net al. propose an approach to handle these issues.\
    \ “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Deﬁned Network (SDN)\nin Smart City Applications”\
    \ is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette ﬁrmware can be integrated into a single\
    \ network\nusing the SDN controller [22].\nIn “Software-deﬁned Content Dissemination\
    \ Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Sce-\nnarios”, [111]\
    \ introduces a new way to ﬁnd the right online distribution channel described\
    \ in the healthcare ecosys-\ntem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV)\
    \ is an emerging concept that depends on smart transport, includ-\ning ambulances\
    \ and additional healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect\
    \ to the internet, espe-\ncially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately\
    \ and contact tracing, this IoHV is helpful and is deployed\nacross a smart city\
    \ setup. All healthcare vehicles are connected to each other through different\
    \ types of links: vehicle-\nto-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure\
    \ (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),\nand cellular links [147]. To overcome\
    \ congestion and improve response, the global information of devices is stored\n\
    in the deletable BF in the proposed framework. While implementing in the real\
    \ world, there are many ambient\nintelligence challenges. Some of them related\
    \ to healthcare are listed below:\nAdopting Advance healthcare technology: Almost\
    \ all medical devices are connected to IoT devices. The man-\nagement systems\
    \ like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information, etc. are\
    \ now handled by ML and\nAI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network\
    \ of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software\ndevelopment companies.\
    \ which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.\n\
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated\
    \ while using medical devices\nand AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare\
    \ companies lack data management systems and new architec-\nture.\nRising Healthcare\
    \ cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes\
    \ the manufac-\nturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing\
    \ processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab\ntests and do regular follow-ups.\n\
    246\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nPayment\
    \ Veriﬁcation: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number of transactions\
    \ is done digitally\nand payment veriﬁcation is required. In this lieu, Pratim\
    \ et al. a lightweight payment veriﬁcation based on the\nblockchain using BF is\
    \ proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for the full\
    \ location of\na small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy\
    \ leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It\nmay allow the full site\
    \ to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insigniﬁcant liaison service for\
    \ funds available\nfrom BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the\
    \ great difﬁculty in its ability to make a computer\nwhile crashing its system.\n\
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic\
    \ Health Records (EHR)\ncollection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching\
    \ targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference,\nYuan et al. [259]\
    \ propose a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in\
    \ the cloud. They\nimprove the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To\
    \ improve search efﬁciency, the Cuckoo ﬁlter is used\nand gives a facility to\
    \ data owners for modiﬁcation (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud.\n\
    7.2. Smart transportation\nFor moving from one place to another, horses and camels\
    \ were used for a long time in society. The world has\nentered the next phase\
    \ of the movement, namely smart transport, with the advent of new technologies\
    \ and smart\ntransportation systems [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future –\
    \ it is already our present”, says Lisa Jerram, senior\nanalyst at Pike Research,\
    \ simply to make sure the easy journey is acceptable as cities become more populous\
    \ and\nface potential budget crises by building new infrastructure, as is the\
    \ case in Europe, North America and Japan, [38].\nAccording to [274], the population\
    \ of the world’s urban areas increased from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008,\n\
    and it is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.\n7.2.1. Application of smart transportation\n\
    To meet the increased demand of citizens, the easy option is to provide then better\
    \ transport services. With this\nthe growth in supply of automobile is increases,\
    \ due to that the trafﬁc congestion is also increases. The attraction to\nthe\
    \ development of smart transport system took a lot of attention to addressing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and rapid urban\ngrowth [71]. It is identiﬁed that the implementation\
    \ of smart technologies is the key factor in gaining intelligence\nand stability\
    \ [107,233]. Also several researchers shown that how this sustainability achieving\
    \ the environmental and\neconomic efﬁciency [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation\
    \ is very important in today’s society. There are\nvarious application under smart\
    \ transportation are discussed as follows:\nSmart Street Light: – Smart city should\
    \ also needs to upgrade Road street light to smart street light. It helps in\n\
    reducing the energy consumption by dimming the lights. This saved energy are then\
    \ used for other services like\npollution monitoring, update about whether, GPS\
    \ etc. and also help in signing available parking in nearby area.\nBut smart street\
    \ lights are depending on its feature and requirements, and involve a combination\
    \ of cameras and\nsensors. Sensors and Cameras are collecting the data can either\
    \ process locally if street light have computing device\nor propagate through\
    \ network. These devices can detect the movement which enable dynamic lighting\
    \ and dimming\n[102]. Chen et al. present a system which used for controlling\
    \ the street lights using TX2 device and also help in\nupdating the parking status\
    \ to users (Fig. 13).\nIntelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art\
    \ transport system is heavily inﬂuenced by\nMachine Learning (ML) and Dynamic\
    \ Range Learning (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles,\ndispatch\
    \ passengers in a safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the\
    \ various advance technologies\nlike senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302].\
    \ The huge amount of data is being generated by these IoT devices\nand sensors\
    \ which contributes to the concept of intelligent cities and the future of ITS\
    \ [312]. The techniques like\nAI, ML, and especially DRL play an important role\
    \ as an integral part of sustainable in precisely monitoring and\nmeasuring real-time\
    \ data trafﬁc ﬂow in an urban area [301,305].\nThe various applications of ITS\
    \ are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent highway in Britain, which reduces\n\
    the trafﬁc and accident rate, The CRITER system in Lyon, France, offers transportation\
    \ workers a schematic plan\nlike a map and also predicts the bottleneck points.\
    \ In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC) measure the physical\ncharacteristics\
    \ of vehicles and check and deduct charges automatically if they are in ETC. It\
    \ is useful to avoid\nillegal entry into the city. Include IoT in ITS to build\
    \ a system where communication between road facilities,\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n247\nFig. 13. Smart street light\
    \ scenario [59].\nvehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers.\
    \ The Global Positioning System (GPS) is replaced by\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) in the IoT to become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author\n\
    also discusses the services for passengers on public transport, like service range,\
    \ charging, security control, and\nadministration.\nAvailability of Parking: –\
    \ With the rapid growth of vehicles in the city, it is a trick for drivers to\
    \ ﬁnd available\nparking. This dilemma is seen as an opportunity to increase the\
    \ efﬁciency of parking facilities, thereby decreasing\nroad accidents and taking\
    \ less time to ﬁnd free space in a smart city. The troubles related to parking\
    \ and trafﬁc\ncongestion could be solved if drivers were aware in advance of the\
    \ availability of parking in the area and surround-\ning areas [39]. A smart and\
    \ automated system that can detect empty parking spaces can reduce search time,\
    \ by\nﬁnding out where parking is available and bypassing lawful information to\
    \ drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image\nprocessing system that takes video\
    \ as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block [176]. These\n\
    frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems may be improved\
    \ if the availability of data and\nthe techniques to manage this data were improved\
    \ or changed with new technologies.\nStreet lights can also play an important\
    \ role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional\nparking\
    \ (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by [59].\
    \ They use Jetson TX2, an\nNVIDIA’s Computer Uniﬁed Device Architecture embedded\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence supercomputer, which has high\npower efﬁciency. This\
    \ system works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control\
    \ system. Parking\nspace is detected by marker-based image processing using the\
    \ onboard camera of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) [67].\nTrafﬁc Control: –\
    \ The authorities are facing chaos trying to manage the trafﬁc with an increase\
    \ of vehicles on the\nroads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities\
    \ are moving toward smart trafﬁc control to manage the city’s\ntrafﬁc. To reduce\
    \ congestion in the context of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of\
    \ smart robots is to give\ninformation to avoid ideal roads and manage trafﬁc\
    \ congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal trafﬁc behaviour or\ntrafﬁc violations,\
    \ the system uses street cameras [66]. But it is not possible to install street\
    \ cameras everywhere in\nthe city. Modern cars with video storage cameras have\
    \ been introduced to control trafﬁc violations in the city. These\ncars capture\
    \ the videos in the city and report any violations that happen to the authorities.\
    \ Rathore et al. propose a\nsystem to detect the front car and road line using\
    \ the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough transform\nfor self-driving.\
    \ A violation detection algorithm is designed for the fog device smart to identify\
    \ driving violations,\nU-turns, and driving central dividers [222]. Steve Mazur\
    \ has also presented a trafﬁc control system (Fig. 14) in\n[180].\nAutomated Toll\
    \ Collection: – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use\
    \ of the cream road\nis required. The government and road contractors are working\
    \ on making the new highways and ﬂyovers in the\ncities, and contractors are installing\
    \ their toll on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters\n\
    are spending their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax.\
    \ Due to this, the parking problem, trafﬁc\n248\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nFig. 14. Smart trafﬁc control [180].\ncongestion,\
    \ and pollution are increasing near the toll plaza. Commuters are also facing\
    \ delays, which increases\nthe travel time for their journey [34]. Automatic toll\
    \ collection is on the rise nowadays, both by governments and\nresearchers. The\
    \ main concern with this automated toll collection system, the RIFD tag, is that\
    \ it is installed on\nthe windshield of vehicles. To collect the required amount,\
    \ the vehicles pass through the sensor system before the\ntollgate [134]. Regular\
    \ user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards. So that the trafﬁc at tollgates\
    \ can be\navoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an alert message based toll collection\
    \ system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU)\n[34]. This system also helps in stopping\
    \ the payment violation by send the alert message if the any vehicle violate\n\
    the toll payment. This system is totally man free and barricade free, which also\
    \ help in rush hours to handle the\ntrafﬁc [34]. As the use RIFD tags not only\
    \ the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in toll plazas [8].\nSmart\
    \ Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in smart transportation\
    \ as it is consistent with the\ndevelopment of a sustainable world [101]. In particular,\
    \ either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or a complete\nfailure [31].\
    \ Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using new technologies like\
    \ IoT, ICT etc. Some\ntourists use apps to plan their journey, but they get limited\
    \ information and priorities for travel recommendations\n[205]. Smart mobility\
    \ is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity of a smart\
    \ city. Smart\nmobility also helps in improving the trafﬁc control system by giving\
    \ access to other routes in emergencies or trafﬁc\njams. Intelligent navigators\
    \ facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances\
    \ and\ngovernment. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming\
    \ year, smart mobility transform into mobility\nas a service paradigm, like car-sharing\
    \ [205].\n7.2.2. Beneﬁts of smart transportation\nFigure 15 explores a picture\
    \ of smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many beneﬁts,\
    \ some of\nthem are discussed as.\nSmart Transportation is safer: – In smart transport\
    \ the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing trafﬁc\nand road accidents.\
    \ In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices help in monitoring the\
    \ trafﬁc situation\nand intimate the same to users for improving road safety.\n\
    Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates the\
    \ public administration by allowing\nto monitor the performance of road safety\
    \ and trafﬁc. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and\n\
    tracks where maintenance is required.\nSmart Transport is very effective: – With\
    \ better management of resources in smart transport gives more efﬁcient\nresults.\
    \ If we are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement\
    \ is required. It also provides\nbetter-quality ﬁlling rates.\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n249\nFig. 15. Smart transportation\
    \ [180].\nSmart Transportation is more cost-effective: – Smart transportation\
    \ also helps in reducing the cost by providing\nthe best shortest routes, giving\
    \ information regarding facilities available with approx distance and price, and\
    \ many\nmore. Commuters also take beneﬁt if they get affordable public transport\
    \ as compared to hiring a private CAB.\nSmart Parking Management: – In smart parking\
    \ the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of ﬁnding the avail-\nable space\
    \ for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time data\
    \ from connected devices\nand sensors.\nSmart Trafﬁc Management: – With the smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system users can get information about conges-\ntion on road.\
    \ So that they can plan their journey accordingly.\nSmart Transportation provides\
    \ instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information in-\n\
    stantly regarding the issue in the city, trafﬁc congestion, and problem areas\
    \ using trafﬁc management centers. They\nalso ensure public safety and provide\
    \ information on affordable insurance plans.\nIntegrated Ticket Systems: – It\
    \ will also provide diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent\
    \ ticket\nsystem in some local services.\n7.2.3. Challenges in smart transportation\n\
    A large number of vehicles in major cities around the world has posed major transportation\
    \ and stability chal-\nlenges, like air pollution, trafﬁc congestion and energy\
    \ problems [284]. Following are some challenges to smart\ntransportation.\nSecurity:\
    \ – Vulnerable to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers.\
    \ Cyber attacks are\nmore common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the\
    \ internet increases. The data ﬂow during the smart\ntransport management system\
    \ are may be hacked or used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication.\n\
    The security of data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During\
    \ ﬁnding the available parking space user\nshare their location, this also may\
    \ create problems in user security.\nData Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved\
    \ without their knowledge. The user’s personal identity must not be\nidentiﬁed\
    \ or traced. Data privacy in smart transport is the main concern. Under the new\
    \ law, data processing must\nhave legitimate.\nSupply Chain: – Due to epidemics\
    \ like Covid-19 the global supply chain is affected. While transportation may\n\
    face various problems during this epidemic. Due to that many businesses are affected.\
    \ When the drivers may ill and\nmove from one region to another it may cause public\
    \ health.\nEnvironmental Problem: – With the rapid growth in the automobile industry\
    \ the trafﬁc on roads also increases.\nThis may affect the air quality and water\
    \ pollution in nearby residential areas. The environmental problems caused\nby\
    \ the IoT devices are currently serious and need to be addressed urgently [180].\n\
    Health Concern: – Health concern is also one of the challenges to smart transportation.\
    \ If the transport system is\nnot connected to hospitals, then it may cause major\
    \ problems or may loss their lives in road accidents. The system\nneeds to improve\
    \ its service on road, and proper intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police\
    \ stations).\n250\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n7.2.4. Applications of PDS in smart transport\nThe trafﬁc on roads in\
    \ both rural and urban areas is increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage\
    \ the trafﬁc\nand distribute the trafﬁc load by making the transport system to\
    \ be smart. It includes smart parking, smart street\nlights, violation check on\
    \ the roads, trafﬁc control system etc.\nData Dissemination: – It means the statistical\
    \ data is transmitted or distributed to end-users. In Pursuing a\nPub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT)\
    \ project use BF to store the path information in source routing. The main scenario\n\
    of this project is general data dissemination [16].\nPrivacy Preserving: – The\
    \ IoT devices and sensors are used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data,\
    \ to\nimprove the transport system. As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive\
    \ information (like vehicle registration\nnumber, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.)\
    \ was released to the cloud. The most accurate way to protect data\nprivacy is\
    \ to encrypt data before extracting it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly\
    \ over encrypted data is a\ndesirable way to make the best use of encrypted data.\
    \ Wang et al. has proposed a brand new idea for acquiring\nmultiple keywords (compound\
    \ keywords) in random search [282]. Unlike most existing keyword search programs,\n\
    the program eliminates the requirement of a predeﬁned keyword dictionary.\n7.3.\
    \ Smart environment\nMany developed cities suffer from poor air quality as population\
    \ and industry growth rapidly. Increasing accep-\ntance of smart transport data\
    \ in smart cities around the world has provided unprecedented opportunities to\
    \ improve\nair quality management in transportation [284]. Government agencies\
    \ and residents are increasingly concerned with\nair grade, which contributes\
    \ to a wide range of human environments and human development. The most common\n\
    methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level simulations.\
    \ These standards produce disappointing\neffects that have led to aspects inﬂuencing\
    \ the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of the\nbuilding.\
    \ Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is time-consuming.\
    \ Modeling incorporated\ntesting is a new expansion to measure air pollution and\
    \ conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally,\nmaximum houses\
    \ in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140]. Liu\
    \ et al. suggested a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment\
    \ in smart cities, which predict air quality\nthat assists Staked Auto-Encoder\
    \ (SAE) [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities.\
    \ The\ninternal components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing\
    \ SAE. The total error rate is 0.46 and\nthe class accuracy of 91.22% is shown\
    \ by this model, it still needs to be improved.\nJovanovska et al. proposed and\
    \ air quality system based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and\n\
    control air pollution using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3),\
    \ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and most\nimportant PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators\
    \ of contamination that cause health risks like heart and lung\ndiseases. So,\
    \ improving the quality of air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and\
    \ health of every citizen.\n7.3.1. Challenges in smart environment\nThe major\
    \ challenges for the environment are water pollution, air quality, and radiation.\
    \ To achieve sustainable\ngrowth by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance\
    \ is needed in the world. With the development of IoT and\nsmart sensors, Smart\
    \ Environmental Monitoring (SEM) is the system for environmental monitoring, in\
    \ the latest\nyears [273]. Figure 16 shows various issues of environment like\
    \ temperature, radiation, dust, humidity, ultraviolet\nsignal etc. For establishing\
    \ the system Silvia et al. used the WSN which provides an interface between smart\
    \ sensors\nand IoT Devices [273].\nAir quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid\
    \ increase in trafﬁc and industries, air pollution is one of the primary\nconcerns\
    \ of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions\
    \ of harmful gases like CO,\nNO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted\
    \ because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality\nneeds to be checked,\
    \ and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze\
    \ the data\nto predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry\
    \ Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor\nthe local air quality [175]. Dhingra\
    \ et al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to\n\
    monitor and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based\
    \ application has various features\nlike air quality, daily forecasts, health-related\
    \ tips, and risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with\nbig\
    \ data generated from sensors, then this application has faced some computational\
    \ complexity problems. For that\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\n251\nFig. 16. Challenges in smart environment.\nDhingra et al.\
    \ have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing. The IoT is a\
    \ global system of “smart\ndevices” which can detect and communicate with the\
    \ environment and interact with users and other applications.\nQian et al. found\
    \ that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system does\
    \ not work well and\nit also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is highly\
    \ correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where\nthese systems are\
    \ leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate\
    \ data neglect Qian\net al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution\
    \ Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method\nis used to compile and integrate\
    \ air pollution data.\nWater quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality\
    \ is important in determining water safety and related pub-\nlic health [256].\
    \ Water quality parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.\nBacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion,\
    \ free chlorine, and pH are the typical parameters\nof water quality [215,219].\
    \ The various research papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water\
    \ pollution\ncontrol systems using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of\
    \ water in the lake can be predicted using an\nML-based neural network for machine-reading\
    \ which analyzes the sensed image [160]. The water is classiﬁed as\npure or polluted,\
    \ and we studied the separation of water pollution with the use of ML methods\
    \ and IoT devices [61].\nThe prediction of water quality parameters using AI and\
    \ neural networks and the amounts of sulfate or chloride\npresent in water were\
    \ studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants in water using SVM, the analysis\
    \ of big data\nand problems faced during the separation of water pollution were\
    \ discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classiﬁcation system\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ and technology used for testing and its separation from non-drinking water [41,128].\n\
    Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution was investigated, which\
    \ used IoT video surveillance and\nML tools to separate dirty and clean water\
    \ [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use, another\nfunction\
    \ which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the water suggested\
    \ [311]. Different ML models\nwere used to test the concentration of chlorophyll-A\
    \ in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water\nmanagement system\
    \ [163].\nAgriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust\
    \ agricultural production methods has ac-\ncelerated to ensure the quality and\
    \ quantity of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”,\n\
    Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the\
    \ relevant growth factor for any\nnation [210]. It also helps in product development\
    \ and sustainable growth to handle major challenges in the agricul-\nture sector\
    \ [196,239]. Ullo et al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where\
    \ the SEM system is a smart\nagricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture\
    \ sector, various factors are very important for achieving\nsustainable production,\
    \ like water level, water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc.\
    \ These features are\nincluded in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which\
    \ is monitored and controlled using IoT devices, smart\nsensors for agriculture\
    \ data capturing, and WSN to transmit data into the cloud [273].\n252\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 17. Smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system using IoT devices and sensors.\nIn the new agricultural era,\
    \ there is a growing market for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The\
    \ various\nstudies and research on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM)\
    \ are discussed, which include fertilizer con-\ntrol, crop monitoring measures,\
    \ pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system for plant growth monitoring\
    \ i.e.\n‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use a 3rd-degree regression\
    \ model and provide a prediction with a\nhigh computational complexity of 98%\
    \ accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality test to monitor\n\
    the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data [242]. In the\
    \ rice quality test, SVMs were used\nwith limited sample size and back distribution\
    \ features. The land and its size play an important role in checking the\ngrowth\
    \ level of different crop species that are either satisfactory or not. To measure\
    \ the leaf index Hosseini et al.\npropose a system with a Gaussian process model\
    \ [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a lim-\nited sample size\
    \ [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water quantity\
    \ used for plant irrigation, an\nexpert system using AI was developed [78] using\
    \ the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data\ntaken from agriculture.\
    \ UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and soil health\
    \ for phenological\ndata of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest monitoring\
    \ [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in\nthe various uses of SEM systems.\
    \ Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth of plants. Ullu\
    \ et\nal. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil, moisture,\
    \ air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the\ncontext of SEM using IoT devices,\
    \ AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while smart agricul-\n\
    ture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making, and storage management\
    \ [249]. The data is moving\nwhile performing the techniques to achieve smart\
    \ agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers and\nresearchers.\
    \ Some of them are addressed below.\n7.3.2. Challenges in smart agriculture\n\
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production\
    \ will increase 70% by the year\n2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture\
    \ have been discussed (Fig. 18) as.\nIrrigation management: – One of the objectives\
    \ of an irrigation system is to calculate the water requirement for\ncrops based\
    \ on collected data and water ﬂow without interference from humans. Irrigation\
    \ systems use dispersed\nsensors to monitor the different soils, water bodies,\
    \ vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the\nmost important\
    \ variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer can adjust\
    \ his irrigation system in\na variety of ways according to soil and weather conditions\
    \ [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n253\nFig. 18. Challenges in smart\
    \ agriculture.\nweather from almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the\
    \ new infrastructure for irrigation in a very exciting\nway. Smart IoT-operated\
    \ irrigation systems use embedded sensors in the ﬁeld to monitor soil structures,\
    \ climate,\nand agricultural irrigation conditions.\nSoil management: – Soil monitoring\
    \ is one of the most challenging agricultural activities for both businesses and\n\
    farmers. Various soil parameters like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil\
    \ management and IoT sensors can be\nused to calculate these parameters. Soil\
    \ management helps in ﬁnding the right kind of plants and helps to identify\n\
    fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop production can be affected by soil testing\
    \ due to a number of environmental\nconcerns. The process and patterns of farming\
    \ can easily be understood, if these types of problems are well deﬁned.\nCrop\
    \ production may improve and fertilization practices can be promoted based on\
    \ ﬁndings of a soil survey study for\nfarmers [37]. The moisture and humidity\
    \ sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology identiﬁes\n\
    the contaminated soil and shields the ﬁeld from over-fertilization and damage\
    \ to crops. Agricultural productivity\nand quality may increase, pollution can\
    \ be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management.\nClimate\
    \ management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use\
    \ of an IoT-enabled weather\nforecast system, farmers can determine the best time\
    \ to plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors\nattached\
    \ to the ﬁeld, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air temperature.\nOn the basis of historical results, to maximize\
    \ the yield, farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and\nirrigation\
    \ season. By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate\
    \ steps to ensure a safe\ncrop yield. Many of the right things are put together\
    \ to maintain and establish a good plant environment while living\nunder stringent\
    \ limits like airﬂow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, where for\nadvanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent\
    \ sensors and devices, this can be achieved [288].\nAccurate farming: – The traditional\
    \ method of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on phys-\n\
    ical examination. If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error\
    \ after being involved in a serious\n254\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nincident on the farm. Farmers will face various\
    \ different types of challenges while farming, like less water, ﬂoods,\nlack of\
    \ suitable planting space, and cost control. Productivity can be improved with\
    \ the use of IoT in agriculture.\nWith the use of gathered information, farmers\
    \ can organize their farming activities, including what seeds they should\nsow,\
    \ what crop yields should be expected, the time to harvest, and how much fertilizer\
    \ to use. Example: The natural\nsoil diversity of a ﬁeld is an accurate agricultural\
    \ practice. The plants can be planted thicker and the irrigation can\nbe used\
    \ sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more water. Alternatively, if\
    \ the site is used for grazing, we can\ntake more cattle than an equivalent area\
    \ with a lower level of the soil.\nNutritional management: – As the human body\
    \ needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require\naccurate nutrition.\
    \ Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the right prices and\
    \ at the right times.\nToo much and too limited nutrients for plants will affect\
    \ the environment. For example, too much phosphorus,\nammonia, or nitrogen may\
    \ reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop cycle\
    \ allows\nfor balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation\
    \ and economic costs, achieving sustainable\nagriculture, nutrition, and technology\
    \ are essential [6].\nGarbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds\
    \ is common during farming. This needs to be\ncontrolled, but in an intelligent\
    \ manner. For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which\n\
    can smartly sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network\
    \ disposal is used to read, store and\ntransmit with the help of these smart trash\
    \ cans. Garbage management can be done with the help of some smart and\nsystematic\
    \ algorithms [10].\nLivestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role\
    \ in agriculture, so they need intention, proper care,\ntimely feeding, etc. It\
    \ is a growing worldwide issue to provide enough food to the world’s people with\
    \ the grow-\ning agricultural production. As a result, the importance of livestock\
    \ management on farms is crucial to survival.\nTo improve the quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products, new technology like IoT advances is important. It\n\
    also improves the quality of livestock by allowing farmers to make decisions based\
    \ on data-driven. To monitor the\nlivestock’s welfare remotely and identify their\
    \ habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power communica-\ntion sensors\
    \ [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory rate, digestion, blood\
    \ pressure, heart rate, and\nother day and night vital signs can be checked by\
    \ farmers using connected sensors. But the data ﬂow between these\nsensors and\
    \ smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure and well\
    \ managed to get efﬁcient\nresults.\nFarm Management System (FMS): – Smart farming\
    \ promotes productivity while minimizing environmental in-\nﬂuences, but this\
    \ smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With\
    \ the help of WSN\nand GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture\
    \ the data with a small controller [199]. With the\nuse of sensors and smart devices\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the identiﬁer is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,\
    \ fertility,\nand weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,\
    \ and analysis of the farm operations can\nbe automated using an IoT-based farm\
    \ management system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and\nbusiness\
    \ operations. The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals\
    \ and pests. But also automatic\nirrigation systems can increase the water consumption\
    \ [105,137].\nTracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures\
    \ to remotely track soil structure and\nits status in accordance with the needs\
    \ of plant culture. The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked\n\
    using GPS devices and wireless network connections. The real-time data processing\
    \ is tracked and approved by\nconnecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like\
    \ the Central Monitoring Station (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The\nGPS also enables\
    \ the farmer to take actions based on notiﬁcations sent to the farm manager through\
    \ SMS or MMS.\nIt is often used in agriculture to detect precise location and\
    \ control capacity, despite it having high operating and\nmaintenance costs.\n\
    Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s crop is most important in farming.\
    \ Farmers use good seeds,\norganic fertilizers, proper watering etc. for best\
    \ results. For farmers to protect themselves from them, they use\nchemical medicines\
    \ and fertilizers, which may later affect the human body. So, it required an intelligent\
    \ system that\nprotects the crop from insects and does not affect the human body.\
    \ This can be done by plant management, which\ninvolves monitoring and recording\
    \ the welfare of the crop. The plant and its diseases can be detected using RFID\n\
    chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can process the data remotely and take necessary\
    \ steps like keeping the insects\nfrom plants. The production of rice for a speciﬁc\
    \ country with a Chinese monitoring station using SVM [152].\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n255\nFarmers can also prevent\
    \ the risk and plan their farming practices by demonstrating an effective calculation\
    \ strategy\nfor coffee fruit [68].\nWater Management: – The major challenge in\
    \ greenhouses is to determine how much water is required i.e. wa-\nter management\
    \ [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed to control the waste of water and operate\
    \ them by using a\nvariety of IoT techniques. Automated drip irrigation is used\
    \ to control the soil moisture in irrigation and storage of\nwater in greenhouses.\
    \ The farmers are checking the water levels in a water tank with their Android\
    \ phones. With\nthe use of IoT devices and sensors, the whole water management\
    \ is done like the motor is automatically started and\nstopped by checking the\
    \ level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional irrigation systems,\
    \ up to 50% of\nwater is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS) provides a\
    \ system to overcome this issue. This system helps the\nfarmers to avoid water\
    \ wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation. SIS\
    \ also transmits\nthe knowledge of the ﬁeld to the farmer using temperature and\
    \ soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their\nirrigation according to\
    \ the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture\
    \ WD-\nSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,\
    \ various consensus mechanisms\nare used, and results show a trade-off is required\
    \ between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19. Water distribution\
    \ systems chain architecture [172].\nBlockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve\
    \ agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed\na secure\
    \ data storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,\
    \ agricultural contracts, and\ninformation about farm conditions from a reliable\
    \ source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers\nand consumers\
    \ and establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps\
    \ in tracking the food\nfor timely payments to stakeholders [191].\nTo monitor\
    \ the farm and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used.\
    \ To adopt the current\ncondition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices\
    \ as they use smartphones anywhere in the world. New\ntechnologies like IoT have\
    \ the potential to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production.\
    \ To\nface the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured\
    \ by providing different IoT-based tools\nand techniques. A massive amount of\
    \ unstructured data has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to\n\
    solve issues like handling big data with real-time response.\n7.3.3. Applications\
    \ of PDS in smart environment\nEnergy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness: – To improve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness. Yousef et al.\npropose a scheme in underwater\
    \ WSN for water pollution monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step\
    \ to\nreduce the number of transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious\
    \ energy. This type of project is mainly\nused in deep water like the sea and\
    \ ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for customer’s identity and privacy-preserving\n\
    of transferred data in WDS [173]. They also suggest the optimal parameters of\
    \ BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000\n256\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nnumbers of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain,\
    \ BF is used to match the authentication of network nodes in\nproof-of-authentication(PoAuth).\n\
    High-performance communication networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers,\
    \ actuators, and base sta-\ntions that need communications between them and send\
    \ millions of data that need to deliver with high-performance\ncommunication networks.\
    \ IoT devices that may have limited power resources or limited integration areas\
    \ have an\nimportant research challenge. To increase the performance of IoT communication\
    \ networks alassery et al. propose\nan efﬁcient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF\
    \ is used to store the routing information after aggregating packets to\nsend\
    \ receiving packets to upstream routers.\nQuery Optimization: – Under the big\
    \ data domain has been developed an air monitoring system, which poses\nmajor\
    \ challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a scheme for query optimization\
    \ of air quality big data using\nBF index [211]. The efﬁciency of data collected\
    \ in the air quality monitoring system is improved. They create a\nHive data repository\
    \ in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) ﬁle format and the Row Group Index (RGI).\
    \ For basic\ndata types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash function is used and Murmur3\
    \ 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary\ntype by BF in ORC.\nPrivacy-preserving\
    \ Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation algorithm is proposed using\
    \ BF for\nprivacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing system [212].\n7.4. Smart\
    \ industry\nIn world development, industrial growth plays an important role. When\
    \ the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then\nmost people probably think that it\
    \ is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased by 18th century.\n\
    Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces various challenges\
    \ like production, distribution,\nsupply chain management etc [279]. By the year\
    \ 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy\n[80]. The industries\
    \ are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary\
    \ [24].\nPrimary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general people,\
    \ means to sell and supply the products.\nThis sector is place dependent because\
    \ the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector for\n\
    economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The example\
    \ of these sectors are farming,\nmining, and ﬁshing and they extract the raw material\
    \ like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries\nunder the primary\
    \ sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry.\nSecondary industry:\
    \ – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary industries\
    \ used this\nmaterial for construction and manufacturing the products. These industries\
    \ are used to make products like steel for\nautomobiles, textiles for cloths,\
    \ wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery is\
    \ used\nin the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.\
    \ The example of these sectors\nare consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,\
    \ manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this\nsector: Heavy\
    \ industry and Light industry.\nTertiary industry: – The product is manufactured\
    \ from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use\nby consumers.\
    \ Tertiary industries generally they are not making any products but only provide\
    \ services to consumers\nand local industries & markets. The main feature of this\
    \ sector is discussion, experiences, access, etc. The ﬁnancial\nand education\
    \ sectors are two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (ﬁnancial) and\
    \ the other (education)\nis non-proﬁtable. Examples of these sectors are banking,\
    \ educators, administrative, medical, ﬁnancial, insurance,\ntransportation retail,\
    \ wholesale, real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information\
    \ technology and\nso on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary\
    \ sector: Telecommunication, Professional, and Franchises.\nThese industries help\
    \ in growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of the country.\n7.4.1. Industry\
    \ evolution\nThe farming and handicraft economizing processes changed to be monopolized\
    \ by industry and manufacturing\nmachines in the Industry Revolution. These changes\
    \ transformed society fundamentally in terms of living and\nworking styles. In\
    \ the 18th century Britain began this process and spread all over the world. The\
    \ production of\nmanufactured goods and the use of natural resources have increased\
    \ after these technological changes [294]. The\nindustrial evolution has been\
    \ categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as given in Table 5.\nIndustry 1.0: – In\
    \ the years 1760–1850, the ﬁrst revolution was introduced with the mechanical\
    \ theme [225].\nIt used steam, coal, and water mechanization for the manufacturing\
    \ process. Production through machines had\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n257\nFig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0.\nincreased, so\
    \ the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods\
    \ [270]. It also increased the\nstandard of life by creating various goods in\
    \ massive amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam\npower\
    \ [83]. Machines, stream power, and water power played an important role in the\
    \ ﬁrst industrial revolution’s\ngrowth. If we talk about the developing sectors\
    \ in this revolution, textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines,\ncement,\
    \ iron industry, gaslighting, transportation, agriculture, railways, and many\
    \ more are existing there [291].\nIndustry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution\
    \ was introduced with industrialization [131]. With the adop-\ntion of new technologies\
    \ like telephone, electric power, sewage, internal combustion engine, etc. this\
    \ revolution\nmanufactured mass production. The sectors that are developed in\
    \ Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper\nmaking, petroleum, automobile,\
    \ fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electriﬁcation, machine tools, telecommunica-\n\
    tions, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs in America, Britain, and Germany\
    \ [193].\nIndustry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013, the industrial revolution ‘Industry\
    \ 3.0’ was started. In this industry the\nproduction was automatically done without\
    \ human interference so, the production sector grew in the engineering\nﬁeld.\
    \ The automation was fully computerized, which increases the efﬁciency and reliability\
    \ of the industrial system.\nBut automation also affects employment. With the\
    \ growth in technology, many industries start using robots and\nreducing manpower.\
    \ Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated circuits and give\
    \ accurate and efﬁ-\ncient results. Robots can do painting, welding, testing,\
    \ labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of\nRobotics\
    \ there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51].\nIndustry 4.0:\
    \ – In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was ﬁrst proposed by the\
    \ German government. In\nthis revolutionary trend, computerization is used in\
    \ manufacturing [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed\nand all systems\
    \ are communicated using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278].\
    \ These IoT\ndevices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.\
    \ This industry transform information\nthrough Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The\
    \ key components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big\nData, Cyber\
    \ Security, Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry\
    \ 4.0 as “smart manufac-\nturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged\
    \ with the aim of achieving mass production and increasing\nproductivity using\
    \ innovative technologies i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213].\nIndustry\
    \ 5.0: – This revolution in the industry is declared by the European Commission,\
    \ after discussions with\nvarious funding agencies, and organizations in Research\
    \ and Innovation workshops in January 2021. To provide\nservices to humanity this\
    \ industry focuses on and highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain\
    \ concept\nto integrate the generated data from different industries. To achieve\
    \ social goals like employment, the standard of\nliving and development this industry\
    \ plays a key role [43].\nIndustry 5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version\
    \ of industry 4.0. With growing technology, artiﬁcial\nintelligence uses in industries\
    \ also improved. The capability of humans, interaction with computers, and robot\n\
    workers gives efﬁcient and effective results [279]. This industry proposed the\
    \ 3D techniques (like 3D printing or\nadditive manufacturing is used for creating\
    \ 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80].\n258\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the smart industry a huge\
    \ amount of data is moving\nbetween IoT devices. The security of data is also\
    \ a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and\nsafe from unauthorized\
    \ access is also a challenge to the industry.\nData Management: – This is also\
    \ the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over the network\n\
    and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good manner to access\
    \ and get efﬁcient results.\nStorage: – Storage of industrial big data is very\
    \ tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various\nresources\
    \ IoT devices are scattered and not ﬁltered. The storage of that type of data\
    \ is not easy.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n259\n7.4.3. Applications of PDS in smart industry\nRemove ambiguity: –\
    \ The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed\
    \ a technique\n“Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is\
    \ time and space-efﬁcient. They use BF in this tech-\nnique in each node, for\
    \ reducing data duplication. For efﬁcient detect and remove duplicate data [57]\
    \ proposed a\nnew data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’.\n\
    Validation: – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption\
    \ and bypass the unneces-\nsary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This\
    \ process is space-efﬁcient.\n7.5. Smart energy\nSmart energy plays an important\
    \ role in solving the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare,\n\
    agriculture, the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The\
    \ energy-saving systems have al-\nready been developed in various cities and buildings,\
    \ in the last few years. A lot of studies for efﬁcient energy have\nalready been\
    \ done [142]. Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to\
    \ use the terms “Smart\nEnergy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\
    \ Smart energy.\nThe energy system is also facing various challenges like stability,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, cost control, operational\nefﬁciency, environmental issue,\
    \ service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart energy management big data\
    \ an-\nalytics provide new opportunities to deal with these challenges [18]. The\
    \ innovative storage solution and distributed\nresources for efﬁcient power transmission,\
    \ clean power generation, dynamic power distribution, and rational elec-\ntricity\
    \ consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves the energy transmission\
    \ and data collection at\nthe same time by integrating energy and information\
    \ ﬂow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity\n260\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nsectors like cooling,\
    \ heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building etc. It also provides\
    \ affordable, achievable\nsolutions for sustainable and renewable energy [168].\
    \ In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry,\nenergy consumption\
    \ has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence of\
    \ ICT, the energy\nsystems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated\
    \ data from energy-related sources needs to be\nwell structured for efﬁcient and\
    \ fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption\n\
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its\
    \ developing stage and has brought\nchallenges like energy security and the adoption\
    \ of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third\nof the\
    \ total electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and\
    \ mining. So in order to gather\nvaluable information, they have collected a big\
    \ database. This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231].\nThe\
    \ variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of electricity,\
    \ and interaction with the user, is\nbeing collected by the smart grid. To process\
    \ this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],\nclustering\
    \ [232], classiﬁcation [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied. So, the accurate\
    \ prediction of electricity\ndemand and consumption, the operation and generation\
    \ of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively\ndevelop the pricing\
    \ mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives more control\
    \ over the use\nof energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable energy,\
    \ responds quickly to the demand for electricity,\nand also quickly restores and\
    \ detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking\
    \ decision\nfor customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid\
    \ [308]. Energy management uses emerging\ntechnologies like ICT (Fig. 22).\nFig.\
    \ 22. Energy management (energy cloud) [197].\nThe pattern of consumption and\
    \ production of energy is changed due to involving of big data. The energy big\n\
    data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value, velocity, volume,\
    \ and variety [308].\n7.5.1. Challenges in smart energy\nThere are various opportunities\
    \ and some challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here:\n\
    Effectively collection of energy big data: It is very difﬁcult to collect data\
    \ from energy resources for giving\nefﬁcient and effective decision-making and\
    \ quick responses.\nManagement storage of energy big data: This is also one of\
    \ the major challenges for energy big data to provide\nbetter services to customers.\n\
    M. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n261\nMining\
    \ and analyzing of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data\
    \ and analysis is a very\ntough job.\nLack of effective and efﬁcient decision\
    \ making: The decision making is one of the impotent key points of a smart\nenergy\
    \ system, it also needs to be improved by joining efﬁcient techniques like PDS.\n\
    Privacy preserving of energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving\
    \ security to energy big data.\nWith the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of\
    \ data is ﬂowing without any security measures.\nTo achieve the above-discussed\
    \ challenges efﬁcient and effective tools and techniques like PDS are required.\n\
    7.5.2. Applications of PDS in smart energy\nPrivacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed\
    \ a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and\nLossy Networks)\
    \ to defend from Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole\
    \ attack. Cuckoo-\nRPL is also useful to defend from other attacks like version\
    \ number and gray hole attack [303].\nNetwork trafﬁc management: Chaudhary et\
    \ al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based secure communi-\ncation protocol”\
    \ in the Smart Grid environment for their entity communication. They use a cuckoo\
    \ ﬁlter for fast\nforwarding of data [56].\nLoad Balancing: Debnath et al. present\
    \ a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for ﬂash storage device. This scheme also\nachieved\
    \ the load balancing of elements across the BF component. This scheme proves that\
    \ the BF is useful in load\nbalancing techniques [72].\n7.6. Smart governance\n\
    Smart governance means accessing the government services free and in a better\
    \ manner using various free data\nprojects. With the emergence of ICT in smart\
    \ cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by the\ncities [159].\
    \ Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies can play an important\
    \ role in providing a\ncollaborative platform. A smart economy also emphasizes\
    \ economic competitiveness in the development of the city,\non the competitive\
    \ edge economic and human activity [143].\nSmart Economy: – Smart economy that\
    \ is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-\nefﬁcient,\
    \ is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality\
    \ of life by adopting new inno-\nvative ideas and building new entrepreneurs,\
    \ and start-ups, which increase competitiveness and productivity [263].\nThis\
    \ whole system is based on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic\
    \ advancement. For social\nbeneﬁts smart economy is also expected to deliver more\
    \ products and services without compromising energy and\npollution [144].\nSmart\
    \ Government: – Smart government is the timely demand of the 21st century and\
    \ smart governance is its\nkey tool. The key pillar of smart governance is to\
    \ use technology. The public administration is required to update\nitself with\
    \ the emergence of technology. No one can oppose adopting smart governance as\
    \ it is the new face of\npublic administration, governance, and political process\
    \ [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in\nthe administration\
    \ system and political system and it is the starting face of smart government.\
    \ There is a trend of\nusing modern technologies in public administration for\
    \ smart governance systems by developed countries and their\nresearchers, academicians,\
    \ politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented\
    \ in Fig. 23.\nAn intelligent network is created in the sector of governance and\
    \ it is directly related to the internet where people\ncan connect with each other\
    \ for communication even in remote areas. Better communication with real-time\
    \ objects in\nthe intelligent network is done through the distributed network\
    \ [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so\nit is not artiﬁcial intelligence.\
    \ It only connects to the people for gathering information and making the decision\
    \ and\nuse it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and digital\
    \ applications, a lot of data is produced. The\nsource of big data is social networking\
    \ websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various private and\ngovernment\
    \ websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.\nBig data plays\
    \ an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart governance.\
    \ Researchers,\nacademicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation\
    \ of traditional public administration to modern and\nsmart administration in\
    \ point of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector\
    \ a large\namount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models\
    \ [238]. Big data also help in effective decisions,\nfast and efﬁcient results,\
    \ and expert users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also\
    \ helps in solving\n262\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\nFig. 23. Role of smart government.\ncomplex tools for reforming\
    \ the government but some researchers have doubts about future technologies. Many\n\
    countries have adopted big data for smart governance, but some public administrations\
    \ are still not ready to adopt\nbig data as full ﬂedge. It happens because, for\
    \ implementation of these technologies, data collection, production and\nprocessing\
    \ require a big investment. And those public administrations who implement impulsive\
    \ faces threats and\nchallenges like reducing the productivity, efﬁciency, and\
    \ capacity in governing system [248].\nThe solutions to these challenges, problems,\
    \ and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The\ngovernment\
    \ agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,\
    \ with the help of\nproper use of big data. The government is generating and managing\
    \ the knowledge with their major responsibility\n[5].\n7.6.1. Challenges in smart\
    \ governance\nAdopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already\
    \ adopting big data technologies in smart\ngovernance. But many are facing problems,\
    \ due to their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-\neffectiveness,\
    \ and data available being either unstructured or semi-structured.\nData Privacy:\
    \ Much conﬁdential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration.\
    \ So, it needs to be\nprotected from malicious users.\nApplications of PDS in\
    \ Smart Governance: As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart\
    \ gover-\nnance. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS\
    \ is an efﬁcient data structure for managing\ndata storage and is also compatible\
    \ with new technologies. PDS also helps in protecting data.\n7.7. Smart society\n\
    A smart society means to promote the satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and\
    \ the well-being of metropolitan\nresidents. In this reference, a smart society\
    \ includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure, education,\nliving;\
    \ water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society 4.0 faces the\
    \ challenge with information\nsharing and related knowledge, while in society\
    \ 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due\nto the\
    \ massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.\
    \ The major challenge\nwith big data is to take real-time decisions [94].\nM.\
    \ Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n263\nFig.\
    \ 24. Society evolution 1.0–5.0 [95].\n7.7.1. Society evolution\nSociety is coexistence\
    \ with nature, and according to ethnographers, society 1.0 had begun with the\
    \ birth of humans\nknown as the hunting society (Society 1.0). In 13,000 BC the\
    \ settlements had been ﬁrmly established and irrigation\ntechniques had been developed\
    \ known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the end of the 18th century,\
    \ the steam\nlocomotives were invented and mass production had started, it was\
    \ the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter\n20th century computers\
    \ were invented and the distribution of information was started, this is the information\
    \ society\n(Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century, “super-smart society”\
    \ has introduced and known as (Society\n5.0). The social evolution has categorized\
    \ and concise as given below (Fig. 24).\nSociety 1.0: – This society’s evolution\
    \ begins with the birth of humans. This society is also called a hunting\nsociety.\
    \ People used simple tools for full ﬁll their daily needs including food. People\
    \ have changed their habits on\nthe availability of resources [138].\nSociety\
    \ 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social evolution was introduced with new developing\
    \ agriculture techniques\nand it is also known as an agrarian society. With the\
    \ advancement of technology and demographical changes, this\nrevolution is transformed\
    \ from the earlier society revolution [29]. In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery\
    \ and the\ncultivation of barley and wheat were found at early stages [14].\n\
    Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin at the end of the 18th century,\
    \ when modern physics, gravity law, and\nthe invention of the steam engine had\
    \ discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society changes the face\n\
    of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions are one of the\
    \ growing ﬁelds in terms of economy\nas well as academia [254]. This also builds\
    \ the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and many\nmore.\n\
    Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in 1972 in Japan.\
    \ This society aims for a new\nera after the post-industrial revolution in the\
    \ year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human\ncreativity,\
    \ and the transition, and development of society.\nSociety 5.0: – At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-\n\
    smart society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through\
    \ technologies because it is human-\ncentered. This also improves the quality\
    \ of life, the use of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly\n[14].\n\
    7.7.2. Applications of smart society\nThe smart society is directly concerned\
    \ with citizens and daily lives. The main applications are discussed below\n(Fig.\
    \ 25).\nSmart Home/Houses: – To increase the quality of life and independence,\
    \ the homes are equipped with technolo-\ngies called “smart home” [73]. Smart\
    \ homes include home appliances like television, air conditioners, smart fans\n\
    264\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 25. Applications of smart society.\nand lights, etc. are connected with IoT\
    \ devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing\n\
    the services efﬁciently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent\
    \ role to make decisions [181].\nReducing environmental emissions, energy management,\
    \ and increasing home automation is the primary objective\nof smart home [229].\n\
    Smart Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase\
    \ their standard of living. It\nneeds to follow an inclusive strategic approach\
    \ across all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions\nthat are\
    \ controllable, productive, sustainable, economical, and efﬁcient. Smart living\
    \ is changing people’s lives\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al.\
    \ propose an architecture that controls home lighting using a\nBluetooth-based\
    \ Android smartphone [295]. Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to\
    \ face any problem, they\ncall independently also the objective of smart living\
    \ [153].\nSmart Buildings: – Smart building is deﬁned as it is efﬁcient energy\
    \ management, a convenient and comfort-\nable environment with reasonable investment,\
    \ and is designed to provide service and management [169]. A smart\nbuilding also\
    \ includes automated processes like security, heating, lighting, air conditioning,\
    \ ventilation, and many\nmore [221]. To develop the smart building the things\
    \ required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team, and robust\nwireless infrastructure.\
    \ The basic components of smart building for security includes CCTV system, access\
    \ control,\nintrusion system, gate automation etc [184].\nSmart Education: – With\
    \ the advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented\
    \ with\nAI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs\
    \ attention from both researchers and\nacademics [135]. Various smart education\
    \ projects [121] have already been performed in recent years, in which the\nﬁrst\
    \ smart education project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education\
    \ [62] faces certain issues like\naccessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral\
    \ patterns of a student, data integration, data mining, detecting\neffective and\
    \ emotional state of the student, and many more [60].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh /\
    \ Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n265\n7.7.3. Challenges in smart\
    \ society\nEfﬁciency: – All resource uses in a smart society have their limits\
    \ like battery power, memory storage, and\nbandwidth required for communication.\
    \ They directly affect efﬁciency, which also increases with the rapid growth\n\
    in data.\nHeterogeneous data: – The data generated in the super-smart city is\
    \ heterogeneous, which leads to challenges in\nprocessing, analyzing, and mining\
    \ data. Getting adequate information from big data in heterogeneous information\n\
    networks is also a big challenge.\nPrivacy preserving: – On increasing of smart\
    \ technologies in a smart society the issue of security, and privacy is\nthe main\
    \ concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control, authentication, policy\
    \ enforcement etc.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Society: As such we have not\
    \ found any existing use of PDS in the smart society.\nSo here the scope of use\
    \ of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges, there are many\
    \ studies\nand researches available that PDS and its variants give an efﬁcient\
    \ result with memory management, and storage,\nalso to handle heterogeneous data.\
    \ PDSs also provide security to the data.\n7.8. Smart sustainability\nThe idea\
    \ of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability deﬁne that the to meet\
    \ today’s needs without\nsacriﬁcing the future ability to fulﬁll their requirements\
    \ like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging\ntechnologies and digital\
    \ governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance\
    \ between\nthe technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The\
    \ main pillars of sustainability are environ-\nmental, economic, and social. Smart\
    \ sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].\n\
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable\
    \ development’s planning and\nimplementation, the stakeholder and policymakers\
    \ lack practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technolo-\ngies like\
    \ ICT, IoT and cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity\
    \ are being focused\non the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability\
    \ cities depending on the data-driven identiﬁcation\nof the dynamic changes in\
    \ the broadcast relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability\
    \ the data\ncame from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured.\
    \ The IoT technologies measures in smart\nsustainable cities are air and water\
    \ quality, green urban areas, tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation,\
    \ le-\ngality, and security (Fig. 26). Sustainable economic advancement includes\
    \ all the factors that are included in a smart\ncity. These factors are green\
    \ building, smart education, social responsibility, water management, sustainable\
    \ energy,\nsmart health, smart governance, natural resource management, sustainable\
    \ transportation, and waste management\n(Fig. 27).\nFig. 26. Smart sustainable.\n\
    7.8.1. Challenges in smart sustainability\nCollection of data: – For developing\
    \ sustainability a huge amount of big data is required at a place.\nStorage management:\
    \ – The management of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge.\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: – Security and privacy of this data is also the main concern.\n\
    266\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 27. Smart sustainable city.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Sustainability: As\
    \ such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city\nsustainability.\
    \ So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS and its variant\
    \ are very much\neffective in data collection with less time and efﬁcient storage\
    \ management. It also provides security to the data\nmovement in smart sustainability.\n\
    8. Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city\nIn the smart city, the data, and\
    \ information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive beneﬁts. Today,\n\
    billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of data via the internet,\
    \ and social networks. This\ngrowth in data required efﬁcient storage and handling\
    \ of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96].\nTo improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly or annual data\
    \ production from various\ncompanies, hospitals, institutions, and forests is\
    \ at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are\nimportant\
    \ for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized\
    \ data structure given by Burton\nBloom, for efﬁciently storing information of\
    \ static sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely\nused\
    \ in many networking and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing\
    \ uses of PDS in smart cities, it is\nfound that many researchers have used BF\
    \ in healthcare for efﬁcient storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc.\n\
    in various applications Some of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city\
    \ are recapitulated in below (Table 6).\n9. Generational data management\nA massive\
    \ amount of data is ﬂowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs to be managed\
    \ for their well-being\nto be used for both personal and civic data services.\
    \ The use of WEB 3.0 for data management is also important.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\

    \ – May be applicable in smart city applications.\nIslam et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ mechanism using bloom ﬁlter which provides protection from cyber threats\nin\
    \ the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ distributed data storage\nscheme with enabled edge computing. The counting bloom\
    \ ﬁlter is used when the storage checking fails to locate\nthe error data and\
    \ to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al. propose a secure and privacy-preserving\n\
    blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. For secure proﬁle matching, the ‘Key-policy\
    \ attribute-based encryption’\nalgorithm is used, and to verify the authenticity\
    \ of ciphertext, a bloom ﬁlter with hash functions is designed [200].\nA secure\
    \ framework in a sustainable city environment is proposed by Singh et al. for\
    \ smart parking that is energy\nefﬁcient and blockchain-enabled. For secure communication\
    \ of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n(ECC) algorithm is used\
    \ at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data [247].\n10. Research\
    \ opportunities and challenges in smart city\nAs discussed in Section 1.1, big\
    \ data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance from the\n\
    perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured\
    \ data, especially when responses\nare required in real-time, remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the\nidentiﬁed\
    \ research areas are:\nFiltering and processing of sensor data: – The data generated\
    \ by various sensors and wearable devices have\nsome limitations like security,\
    \ privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns. Also,\
    \ have\nincompatibility issues between data and information. The information collected\
    \ by these devices may contain some\nnoise. This sensor data may be also corrupted\
    \ by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue\
    \ needs to be addressed.\nDifﬁcult to monitoring user’s social networking data:\
    \ – It is difﬁcult to monitor users’ data on social network-\ning sites. In smart\
    \ healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system\
    \ for detecting the\npsychological disturbance in patients is presented named\
    \ emotional healthcare. Some techniques used to detect de-\npressive and stressful\
    \ content are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\
    \ and\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation\
    \ systems for patients to get a\ntext-based on the results while they had been\
    \ monitored.\nLack of efﬁcient computational models and data structures: – The\
    \ expansion of massive data has generated\nlarge and complicated data sets. Traditional\
    \ methods used for storage and retrieval of data, increase the computation\noverhead\
    \ in big processing and hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users.\
    \ For big data handling some\nadvanced data, models are required which produce\
    \ results in minimum time with minimum computation overhead.\nOne of the basic\
    \ problems of massive data is to style efﬁcient computational models and data\
    \ structures for solving\nthese problems in big data.\nThe need for energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data processing: – The rise of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for\
    \ a\nsmart city. Energy management has become a major issue resource as IoT devices\
    \ are constantly consuming huge\namounts of energy. These concerns must be considered\
    \ in order to establish an effective mechanism. The efﬁcient use\n272\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nof power aims to\
    \ promise a sustainable city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount\
    \ of data which is needed\nfor optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge\
    \ in securing smart cities is the sharing of data and access control.\nData storage\
    \ and processing: – Smart Cities take hold of the relative advantage of being\
    \ robust for storing\ndata and processing it in the information world. The applications\
    \ of smart cities have generated a continuous huge\namount of data from different\
    \ sources. The existing traditional methods are insufﬁcient to manage this volume\n\
    of data and they have restricted processing speed and effective storage expansion\
    \ costs. To overcome this issue,\nefﬁcient computational models and data structures\
    \ are required.\nVolume data: – Although it is difﬁcult to quantify this challenge\
    \ because data sets are typically very big like hun-\ndreds of terabytes or more.\
    \ The traditional storage system like Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\
    and new big data technologies like Hadoop are developed to efﬁciently count the\
    \ data that must be kept and pro-\ncessed. The new data structures are also required\
    \ to handle and produce results at run time.\nReal time response: – The Response\
    \ Time (RT) in the smart city is very important in term of service, results, data\n\
    transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact that the data transmission and business\
    \ data infrastructure at elevated cost\nand should be considered with fewer delays.\
    \ In this case, various techniques have been used which are depending\non the\
    \ situation and difﬁculty of analysis. In smart cities where responses need to\
    \ be given after processing huge\ndata or by handling streaming data, then traditional\
    \ techniques and approaches are not efﬁcient. So some new data\nhandling techniques/data\
    \ structures are required to provide results in real-time.\nVariety of Data: –\
    \ In the smart city the source of a variety of data is also a major issue. The\
    \ smart city data\nis available in different data sets for different applications\
    \ of smart city and with different format styles like audio,\nvideo, images, text\
    \ etc. The data collected from a variety of sources are ambiguous, unstructured,\
    \ or semi-structured.\nThis data needs to be in a well-structured manner for effective\
    \ and efﬁcient results. The traditional methods are not\nsufﬁcient or even do\
    \ not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data management,\
    \ a new data\nstructure like PDS is required.\nSearching and Retrieving for a\
    \ data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efﬁciently searching\n\
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,\
    \ in a variety of formats, is a major\nchallenge. In some applications when deadlines\
    \ are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious.\nStream Processing(Data\
    \ Collection and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart\
    \ cities is a\nbig challenge. There is a huge amount of data is ﬂow in the smart\
    \ city. The processing and analysis of this set of\ndata are required. When raw\
    \ data is combined like vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media,\
    \ weather\ndata, then the streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long\
    \ time in result, access problem etc. Also\nsome problems in development like\
    \ it is still dependent. Various decisions and predictions are based on this type\
    \ of\ndata like trafﬁc, future power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems\
    \ are proposed but with various limitations.\nA new mechanism is required to design\
    \ for efﬁcient and effective results.\nIntegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources\
    \ (Diversity Consolidation): – The data coming from different sources\nis not\
    \ in proper sequence, maybe in a different format, or ambiguous. The operation\
    \ on these data sets is difﬁcult to\napply like validation, authentication, updating,\
    \ alteration etc. This data is need to be well structured and organized.\nNatural\
    \ Text Analysis and Communication(social media analysis): – The analysis of natural\
    \ text from social\nnetworks is available through mobile devices like smartphones\
    \ is also challenging. This data is used for monitoring\nthe behavior and emotions\
    \ of citizens in real life. The information on location from various social networking\
    \ sites is\nnot in a proper format. The data include the comments and statements\
    \ about the user’s feelings, thoughts, interests,\nrelations etc. are integrated\
    \ with sensor data. The reliability of this data is also a big challenge.\nAmbient\
    \ Intelligence issues/challenges (speciﬁc to the current generation of smart city\
    \ domains): – The ex-\npeditious growth of conversion from rural to urban areas\
    \ and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly. It also\nincreases the usage\
    \ and deployment of smart technologies in everything and everywhere in the city.\
    \ So, smart cities\nmay also face some ambient intelligence issues. The main concern\
    \ in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine\nwith automation and autonomous\
    \ system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs like:\nHuman control\
    \ vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or fooled by scam stickers\
    \ on road by\nautonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving (Uber) had met a\
    \ deadly accident with a woman walking at night\n[185]. Hard Behavior is also\
    \ one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations\
    \ of\ncustomers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without\
    \ the involvement of humans. In AI-based\nbehavior, there are missing traceability,\
    \ transparency, and incomprehensible decisions.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n273\nPrivacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off\
    \ between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data\nshould be\
    \ provided to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.\n\
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used\
    \ for analyzing and gathering in-\nformation. These sensors generally collect\
    \ the data like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these\n\
    types of sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224].\n\
    Hackers vs Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses\
    \ of sensors and IoT technology\nhave expanded.\nBeing Socially Inclusive: The\
    \ programs like ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for\
    \ real-time\nupdates. This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart\
    \ cities can’t afford to take transit, all elderly\ngrowing people do use smart\
    \ mobile devices or apps, and how it is possible to use and reach technology to\
    \ these\ngroups of people?\n11. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper, we have\
    \ discussed the role of big data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance\
    \ of big\ndata in smart cities. In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have\
    \ been discussed. There are various architectures\nthat have been discussed by\
    \ many researchers, but the most appropriate architecture for the smart city is\
    \ elaborated\nin Section 4. Los Angeles took the ﬁrst action or made the ﬁrst\
    \ contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They\nanalyze the urban big data.\
    \ In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also future plans regarding\
    \ smart cities.\nThe role of big data in smart cities is crucial in a smart city.\
    \ Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed\n(Section 6) as a key\
    \ solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes the\
    \ various applications\nof smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,\
    \ smart environment, agriculture, smart governance\nand economy, smart society,\
    \ people, education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found,\
    \ after going\nthrough various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities;\
    \ that there is an inﬂuence of big data in a smart\ncity. Generated data is inconsistent,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured, lack of efﬁciency in retrieval and storage\n\
    management of data, privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city,\
    \ the collection of data itself is a big\nchallenge. The data collected using\
    \ IoT devices, records (medical history), social media, and web pages are too\
    \ large.\nObviously, this data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring\
    \ systems in smart cities also have issues in the\nanalysis and representation\
    \ of this big data with low dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere\
    \ endeavors\ninto extracting information from a huge amount of knowledge databases.\
    \ The main challenge in this effort is that\nthere is no standard approach to\
    \ efﬁciently map and keep the big data on consistent data structures. The existing\n\
    tool and techniques cannot work efﬁciently and satisfactorily in data management.\
    \ To store and processing of data\nfor optimal recovery and exploring procedures,\
    \ data structures like PDS is one of the adequate standards to use. In\nthe conclusion\
    \ of this paper after reviewing related work, we have listed the exiting and scope\
    \ of PDS in various\napplications of smart cities in Table 7.\nTable 7\nDomain\

    \ is essential for food security and economic stability. Unmanned\naerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV) imagery and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are valuable tools for it. The\
    \ purpose\nof this review is to gather several methods used by our peers recently,\
    \ hoping to provide some\nknowledge and assistance for researchers and farmers\
    \ so that they can employ these technologies\nmore advantageously. The studies\
    \ reviewed in this paper focused on Scab detection in Rosaceae\nfamily fruits.\
    \ Feature extraction, segmentation, and classiﬁcation methods for processing the\
    \ UAV-\nobtained images and detecting the diseases are discussed brieﬂy. The advantages\
    \ and limitations\nof diverse kinds of UAVs and imaging sensors are also explained.\
    \ The widely applied methods for\nimage analysis are machine learning (ML)-based\
    \ models, and the extensively used UAV platforms\nare rotary-wing UAVs. Recent\
    \ technologies that cope with challenges related to disease detection\nusing UAV\
    \ imagery are also detailed in this paper. Some challenging issues such as higher\
    \ costs,\nlimited batteries and ﬂying time, huge and complex data, low resolution,\
    \ and noisy images, etc.,\nstill require future consideration. The prime signiﬁcance\
    \ of this paper is to promote automation and\nuser-friendly technologies in Scab\
    \ detection.\nKeywords: Scab; Rosaceae fruits; disease detection; UAVs; artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI); machine\nlearning (ML)\n1. Introduction\nRosaceae fruits\
    \ are grown extensively and cultivated globally. Among Rosaceae family\nmembers,\
    \ apples, peaches, cherries, strawberries, avocadoes, and almonds, are produced\n\
    on a larger scale due to their higher nutritional values. The production of these\
    \ fruits is\nhighly inﬂuenced by pests and different diseases. Among these diseases,\
    \ the Scab is the\nmost acute fungal disease that infects the leaves as well as\
    \ the fruits. It is a threat that\nresults in inadequate quality and heavy wastage\
    \ of Rosaceae fruits. Serious considerations\nand accurate detection systems are\
    \ essential to detect this disease at the initial stages [1,2].\nRosaceae fruits\
    \ have abundant leaves that are observed to detect diseases and sustain\nproduction.\
    \ This observation requires automation through advanced technologies such\nas\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-driven unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can\
    \ capture\nmultiple and enormous quantities of data, store images, reduce timely\
    \ processes, allow\nspraying on the required infected areas only, and so on. Similarly,\
    \ by using subdomains\nof AI, deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) algorithms,\
    \ healthy and infected\nleaves can be identiﬁed and classiﬁed with greater accuracy.\
    \ The studies reported in [3,4]\nemployed these technologies and detected Scab\
    \ disease with greater accuracies, resulting\nin sustainable production.\nBackground:\
    \ Earlier experts were hired for manual tree monitoring, foliage exami-\nnation,\
    \ and disease detection [5]. They were skilled in their domains and had complete\n\
    Drones 2023, 7, 97. https://doi.org/10.3390/drones7020097\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/drones\n\
    Drones 2023, 7, 97\n2 of 32\nawareness of the diseases and their treatments. However,\
    \ this manual diagnosis was\ntroublesome, error-subjective, less accurate, expensive,\
    \ time-consuming, labor-intensive,\nand required expertise. In the early 1960s,\
    \ mechanical laboratories, livestock variables, and\nfertilizer usage expanded\
    \ the scale of agricultural production. To improve detection efﬁ-\nciency, automatic\
    \ detection technology emerged as the times required. Automatic detection\nsystems\
    \ explored by AI techniques replaced manual work with mechanical work and gave\n\
    highly accurate disease detection in less time [6,7].\nRelated Work: Many studies\
    \ have employed AI techniques for Scab detection in\nRosaceae fruits. The outcomes\
    \ of their research show the signiﬁcance of applying DL\nand ML approaches for\
    \ feature extraction, image segmentation and classiﬁcation, and\nthe use of UAV\
    \ imagery. The analysis in [8] provides reviews on various remote sensing\ntechniques,\
    \ features, models, and algorithms to monitor pests, Scab, and other diseases\
    \ in\napples, peaches, and other plants. One study [9] suggests remote sensing\
    \ using UAVs for\ndetecting diseases and weeds, estimating the quality and production\
    \ of fruits, classifying\ntrees, etc. It concludes that UAVs serve as powerful\
    \ tools not only for site management but\nalso for individual tree management.\
    \ Analysis in [10] reviews current applications of UAV\nimaging for mapping and\
    \ detection of diseases, pests, and weeds. Research in [11] lists\nvarious Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices such as UAVs, sensors, and harvesting drones for\nagricultural\
    \ tasks. It describes the beneﬁts of these devices that dominate the barriers\
    \ to\ndisease detection and other agricultural tasks.\nThe study in [12] reviews\
    \ the previous work of numerous authors who describe\nthe use of hyperspectral\
    \ imaging to detect Scab and other diseases. The ﬁndings show\nthat using UAVs,\
    \ preprocessing of hyperspectral images, vegetation index, ML, and DL\nmethods\
    \ provide efﬁcient results for disease detection. Extensive literature on image\n\
    processing and ML techniques is given in [13]. The best results for Scab and various\n\
    disease detection, classiﬁcation, and other applications related to the Rosaceae\
    \ family and\nother fruits were obtained by using DL approaches. In [14], the\
    \ researchers applied a DL\nalgorithm and three classical ML algorithms to detect\
    \ Scab and other diseases in apples,\npeaches, cherries, and various fruits. The\
    \ results prove the dominance of the DL algorithm\nover ML algorithms in terms\
    \ of accuracy and simplicity. The study in [15] details challenges\nand trends\
    \ for Scab and other disease detection while applying DL techniques. It also\n\
    exhibits the signiﬁcance of using different sample sizes and hyperspectral imaging\
    \ for\ndetecting diseases at preliminary stages.\nMotivation and Contribution:\
    \ Agricultural researchers are adopting these advanced\ntechnologies and systems\
    \ for Scab detection. The motivation for this paper is to update\nthem concerning\
    \ these trending technologies, identify gaps in methodologies, and provide\ncomprehensive\
    \ knowledge on approaches for overseeing the gaps. We not only discuss\nrecent\
    \ challenges in using UAVs for disease detection, but also compare and gather\
    \ into\na single platform the novel AI approach employed by previous researchers.\
    \ Relevant\narticles from 2017 to 2022 are summarized for assisting farmers and\
    \ researchers. We used\nGoogle Scholar along with other scientiﬁc repositories:\
    \ ScienceDirect, SAGE Journals,\nSpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, and Wiley Online Library\

    Figure 1. Structure of the paper.\n2. State-of-the-Art in the Research Field\n\
    Automation and digitalization were increasingly adopted for monitoring purposes\
    \ in\nvarious sectors during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\
    \ The automatic\ntechnologies obtained by combining AI techniques with UAVs resulted\
    \ in enhancing\nagricultural production [16]. This high-tech innovation is becoming\
    \ an integral part of\nnumerous research activities and is broadly enhancing the\
    \ agriculture sector. UAVs use\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology\
    \ for autonomous driving [17].\nBeing equipped with a camera or other sensors,\
    \ it identiﬁes obstacles, recognizes its position,\nand avoids collision with\
    \ other UAVs. These are boosted with improved communication\nand data-processing\
    \ speed. The widely applied categories of UAVs are ﬁxed-wing and\nrotary-wing.\
    \ Rotary-wing UAVs are further categorized into helicopters, quadcopters,\nhexacopters,\
    \ and octocopters [18]. These are becoming more efﬁcient, dependable, and\nrobust\
    \ tools in detecting diseases at their initial stages and for spraying fungicides.\
    \ Being\nequipped with sensors, UAVs are highly effective in disease assessment\
    \ [19]. These detect\ndiseases, allow correct decision-making, and apply appropriate\
    \ control measures. UAVs\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n4 of 32\noffer high-resolution imagery\
    \ for efﬁcient disease detection and analysis. These collect\ndata with a higher\
    \ resolution even in challenging weather conditions, thus providing\naccurate\
    \ fruit health assessment and decision-making. Spraying fungicides using UAVs\
    \ is\na current means of disease control [20]. Researchers are optimizing different\
    \ parameters\nsuch as speed, altitude, duration of the ﬂight, tank capacities,\
    \ etc., for efﬁcacy. Operating at\nlower heights reduces mass spraying whereas\
    \ operating at higher heights allows disease\nmanagement in mountainous areas\
    \ as well [21]. Their rotors generate downward airﬂow\nthat makes droplets penetration\
    \ easier. These are considered safer for mapping larger or\nuneven areas.\nAll\
    \ the beneﬁts are enhancing the application of UAVs in the agriculture sector.\
    \ The\nUnited States (US), Australia, India, South Africa, Japan, China, Europe,\
    \ Canada, and other\ncountries are using swarm technology on a wider scale [22].\
    \ Additionally, these countries\nare employing controller systems, propulsion\
    \ systems, navigation systems, camera sys-\ntems, frames, batteries, and other\
    \ devices for numerous agricultural purposes [23]. Major\npurposes are ﬁeld mapping,\
    \ disease detection, crop spraying, livestock monitoring, smart\ngreenhouse, and\
    \ others. In the US, the agriculture drone market is growing rapidly due\nto numerous\
    \ applications of UAVs in agriculture [24]. In Australia, growers in Queens-\n\
    land are using this technology for improving on-farm tasks. Currently, Pakistan\
    \ is also\nemploying UAVs equipped with sensors and other IoT devices for disease\
    \ detection, pest\nmonitoring, temporal and geospatial sampling, mapping, fertilization,\
    \ and others [25]. In\nIndia, the agriculture department of Rajasthan is employing\
    \ UAVs for multiple purposes\nwhile improving parameters and ensuring safety features.\
    \ They have used this technol-\nogy for ﬁghting locust attacks. South Africa is\
    \ adopting smart agriculture not only to\nexpand production but also to contribute\
    \ to the environment by cutting costs and saving\nresources [12]. Researchers\
    \ in China and Japan are employing UAVs, satellites, and AI\ntechniques to formulate\
    \ such strategies that will diagnose the disease before it becomes\nvisible [26].\
    \ They are applying robotics with deep learning to propel the harvesting task.\n\
    Soft grippers are making harvesting tasks possible for UAVs. However, this requires\
    \ further\nimprovement of technology and tools for perfection. Moreover, researchers\
    \ are working on\nmultirobot technologies for agriculture [27]. In the coming\
    \ years, they will use UAVs and\nUGVs (unmanned ground vehicles) for performing\
    \ combined tasks. Table 1, summarize\nthe recent technologies that is used for\

    \ produces lesions or dark blotches on the fruits, leaves,\nand young twigs of\
    \ Rosaceae fruits. The symptoms of Scab are not identical at all stages\nand depend\
    \ upon when the infection took place [28]. At ﬁrst, chlorotic or yellow spots\n\
    appear on leaves, and as the disease progresses olive or dark-colored spots appear\
    \ not only\non leaves but also on fruits. When the disease becomes severe, velvety\
    \ spots appear on\nthe leaves’ undersurface. Leaves turn yellow and start falling.\
    \ Then, these spots formed\non stems force the ﬂower to drop. The fruits affected\
    \ by these spots, which ﬁrst appear\nas olive-green spots, later become black\
    \ or brown lesions. The fruits can become cracked\nand malformed and dropped by\
    \ the plant prematurely [29]. Sometimes Scab appears as\nblack spots on Rosaceae\
    \ fruits. Scabs cause severe surface blemishing that results in high\ncrop losses.\n\
    3.1. Causes of Scab Disease\nFoothill and coastal areas have moist and cool early\
    \ summer and spring weather.\nThese are favorable areas and conditions for pathogen\
    \ development. In addition to these\nfactors, heavy rain is also a major factor\
    \ that causes Scab [30]. Scab is caused by the\npathogen fungus Venturia inaequalis.\
    \ This pathogen found in all the regions where Rosaceae\nfruits are grown. It\
    \ can infect the trees at any time, especially in spring. It affects the leaves\n\
    and then produces and releases spores into the air. These spores are carried by\
    \ rain, wind,\nirrigation, or developing fruit. If the spores are dropped on the\
    \ surface, these spores remain\nstuck to the surface, break through the cuticle,\
    \ germinate, and develop a new secondary\ninfection. This secondary infection\
    \ occurs in speciﬁc periods, within 9–17 days, and may\nrepeat its cycle several\
    \ times during the growing season [31]. This fungal disease is a\nmain issue in\
    \ the production of commercial Rosaceae fruits. It affects the quality of the\n\
    fruits and reduces production. If it is not treated properly, it weakens the trees\
    \ and ﬂower\nbud formations, which leads to an increase in economic loss. This\
    \ disease has no proper\ntreatment; therefore, prevention and early detection\
    \ are important for its control.\n3.2. Ways of Prevention\nThe best way to prevent\
    \ Scab is to select disease-resistant varieties, which have a wide\nrange from\
    \ moderately resistant to very resistant. Another preventive measure is to plant\n\
    trees with sufﬁcient spaces and in open canopies where sunlight is available.\
    \ Planting trees\nwith spaces allows trees to mature properly and sunlight will\
    \ dry the leaves quickly. This\nreduces the chances for spore germination [19].\
    \ The other important measure is pruning.\nRemoving fallen leaves is required\
    \ not only in autumn but also during the entire growing\nseason. Leaves diagnosed\
    \ with Scab must not be thrown in the compost; however, they\nmust be disposed\
    \ of properly. The application of urea after harvest is also beneﬁcial. Proper\n\
    sanitation is also a prime prevention measure. Changing the schedule to water\
    \ trees and\ncovering the soil with compost also prevents the spread of Scab.\
    \ If a tree loses most of its\nleaves, then the application of fungicide is the\
    \ only option. The fungicide does not have any\neffect on the infected trees,\
    \ but it breaks the disease cycle by creating a protective coating\nDrones 2023,\
    \ 7, 97\n6 of 32\nthat keeps the spores inactive. For effective disease management,\
    \ the timing of fungicide\napplication is quite important [3].\n3.3. Early Detection\
    \ Methods\nNumerous ways can be adopted to perceive the pathology of Rosaceae\
    \ fruits. Some-\ntimes the symptoms appear randomly, therefore these are mostly\
    \ ignored. Similarly, over-\ncrowded trees and leaves hinder symptoms and when\
    \ these symptoms become noticeable\nit becomes difﬁcult to take any precautions\
    \ or to treat Scab. These reasons pose challenges\nin Scab identiﬁcation and treatment;\
    \ therefore, early Scab diagnosis is essential through\nprecise and automatic\
    \ disease identiﬁcation [32]. The agriculture industry is adopting\nsensors, advanced\
    \ AI tools, and information perception systems for achieving images and\ninformation\
    \ to make precise decisions for the prevention, identiﬁcation, and classiﬁcation\n\
    of diseases. In [33], three imaging devices: a thermal camera, a multispectral\
    \ camera, and a\n3D sensor, were used for early Scab detection in apples. The\
    \ study reported in [34] applied\na modiﬁed MobileNet CNN model for diagnosing\
    \ Scab and other diseases at the initial\nstages in avocados. In [35], a promising\
    \ PeachNet structure comprising VGG-19, mask\nR-CNN, and a regional proposal network\
    \ (RPN) was used for the early detection of Scab\nin peaches.\n4. Recent Challenges\
    \ in Scab Detection\nAutomatic operations for Scab detection require no direct\
    \ human interactions. The\nmost appropriate solution for this is the use of UAVs\
    \ equipped with imaging sensors\nand advanced AI algorithms [19]. This combined\
    \ technology has beneﬁts in agricultural\noperations; however, owing to challenges,\
    \ their usage is still unpopular and restricted in\nmany countries. Figure 2 highlights\
    \ these challenges that limit UAV application for Scab\ndetection, which are described\

    \ fruits using UAVs.\n4.1. Anomalies of Symptoms and Lab Analysis for Scab Detection\n\
    Diseases are ﬁrst detected by analyzing the symptoms. In some cases, symptoms\
    \ of\nScab disease are quite like other diseases because of ﬁne-grained multiscale\
    \ distribution, the\nsame color texture between background and disease, and the\
    \ growth of multiple diseases on\na leaf [36]. Owing to this symptom relevancy,\
    \ appropriate Scab detection becomes difﬁcult.\nHowever, sometimes Scab shows\
    \ variation in symptoms. This occurs due to several\nreasons such as environmental\
    \ factors, disease developmental stages, presence of other\ndiseases. Environmental\
    \ factors such as humidity, sunlight, temperature, wind, etc., affect\nthe symptoms\
    \ of Scab disease in various parts of trees, whereas Scab also exhibits different\n\
    Drones 2023, 7, 97\n7 of 32\nsymptoms at different developmental stages. In [37],\
    \ many images were obtained during\nfour months under different environmental\
    \ conditions and developmental stages on old\nand young leaves of apples. The\
    \ dataset of Scab images showed the variation in symptoms,\nand many other images\
    \ contained several similar-appearing symptoms that required\nfurther expert conﬁrmation.\
    \ Moreover, molecular techniques and laboratory analysis\nfor Scab detection for\
    \ every fruit are not possible in forests or larger ﬁelds. Additionally,\ntransmission\
    \ charges are also incurred to send the images to distant laboratories for analysis.\n\
    Therefore, such methodologies are required that will overcome all of these challenges.\n\
    4.2. Capacity Limitations of UAV Components That Restrict Flying\nWe discussed\
    \ limitations of UAVs in previous papers that include challenges of control,\n\
    path planning, obstacle detection and avoidance, navigation and guidance, and\
    \ others [38].\nIn this paper, various restricted capacity issues are discussed\
    \ that hinder the performance\nof UAVs in larger ﬁelds of Rosaceae fruits. These\
    \ issues are limited capacities of payload,\nbattery, and in-built data storage.\
    \ Most UAVs have limited payload capacity that constrains\nthe battery size and\
    \ sensor. The limited battery demands shorter ﬂying time and requires\na quick\
    \ interchange of batteries for covering larger agricultural areas of apple orchards.\n\
    Only ﬂying at higher altitudes can cover these areas, but this results in lower\
    \ resolution\nimages [39]. UAVs have less in-built storage capacity, so the captured\
    \ data must be sent\nto other platforms. To cope with these challenges, secure\
    \ and cost-effective devices along\nwith strong Internet connections or IoT devices\
    \ are also core requirements [40].\n4.3. Effects of Forest Attributes on UAVs\
    \ and Images\nFarms and forests have different-sized trees, uneven areas, and\
    \ uncertain climatic\nconditions. Owing to variations in the heights and thickness\
    \ of trees, UAVs require proper\nobstacle-avoidance and path planning. While ﬂying\
    \ above different-sized Rosaceae fruit\ntrees, the complex motion of UAVs must\
    \ manage to allow accurate maneuvers. UAVs\nmust be capable of entering or exit\
    \ any tree row and navigate to the other rows easily [41].\nUneven areas have\
    \ varying altitudes owing to which different elevation angles are formed\nbetween\
    \ the farmland and UAVs. Both issues result in path loss and inﬂuence the coverage\n\
    radius and network services, which lead to crashes. Especially ﬁxed-wing UAVs\
    \ in such\nrough places are usually subject to crashes. Climate plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ part in obtaining\nplant images through UAVs. The speed of UAVs is inﬂuenced\
    \ by high winds and rain [42].\nThis causes angular movement leading to overlapping\
    \ and distortions among images.\nMoreover, high wind changes the position of leaves\
    \ and affects visibility. This leads to\ninconsistencies in images and improper\
    \ disease detection [43]. Therefore, the effects in\nimages resulting from all\
    \ these issues need further analysis and interpretation. It is also\nessential\
    \ to gather knowledge regarding the attributes of forests and larger ﬁelds before\n\
    deploying UAVs.\n4.4. Limitations of Sensors and Factors Causing Visibility Issues\
    \ in Images\nThe interaction process between the Scab pathogen and Rosaceae fruits\
    \ can be de-\ntermined by biochemical and physiological parameters but are restricted\
    \ to be reﬂected\nin speciﬁc reﬂectance wavelength. Sensors provide higher spatial,\
    \ spectral, radiometric,\nand temporal resolution images. While obtaining images\
    \ of Rosaceae fruits via UAVs,\nsensors play an important role but have different\
    \ impacts on different dimensions of reso-\nlution [44]. The altitude of the sensor\
    \ above the ground governs the spatial resolution. If\nthe sensor is closer to\
    \ the Rosaceae fruit, then the coverage is smaller, however, the spatial\nresolution\
    \ is greater. Red, green–blue (RGB) sensors capture higher spatial resolution\n\
    images as compared to multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. RGB sensors provide\n\
    ﬁner details about Scab, but they are restricted to measuring only three electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum bands; therefore, they give less accuracy in Scab detection in terms\
    \ of spectral\nresolution. Multispectral sensors can capture high spatial resolution\
    \ and determine re-\nﬂectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands. They assist in\
    \ early Scab detection but are the\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n8 of 32\nleast affordable\
    \ sensors. Similarly, hyperspectral sensors are also expensive but may deliver\n\
    images with low spatial resolution. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors yield\
    \ higher\nspectral resolution than RGB sensors. Hyperspectral sensors collect\
    \ a large amount of\nspectral data, which causes difﬁculties in acquiring relevant\
    \ details about Scab disease.\nThey yield continuous and high spectral ranges\
    \ that help in differentiating Scab from other\ndiseases, even in the presence\
    \ of minor differences and early detection of Scab. Thermal\nsensors provide the\
    \ temperature of the surrounding objects in the images. Therefore, they\nprovide\
    \ low dimensions of resolution in images for Scab detection.\nDifferent ﬁeld-based\
    \ platforms for Scab detection are vehicles, tripods, UAVs, satellites,\nhelicopters,\
    \ etc. These platforms retain high spatial resolution and reﬁne the measure-\n\
    ment throughput to a certain extent. The satellite platform provides free images\
    \ while\ncovering large areas. These images complement UAV imagery but are restricted\
    \ to low\nresolution [20]. Therefore, it is not suitable for Scab detection. Satellites\
    \ give the low-\nest spatial resolution whereas UAV platforms offer high spatial\
    \ and temporal resolution\nalong with high throughput; therefore, they are best\
    \ for Scab detection. However, ﬂight\nparameters and stability inﬂuence the sensors,\
    \ dimensions of the resolution, and spectral\ndiscrimination. For example, changes\
    \ in UAV speed and altitude also restrict the sensor to\ncapture clear images.\
    \ Another factor is the noise of these sensors that inﬂuence the visibility\n\
    of images. All these factors result in overlapping, uneven resolution, and distortion\
    \ in\nimages. Considering different sensors and platforms, none can yield high\
    \ resolution in\nall dimensions. Researchers are still exploring sensors that\
    \ can provide high-resolution\ntemporal, spatial, spectral, and radiometric data,\
    \ which remain uninﬂuenced by all these\nfactors. Moreover, high-resolution spectral\
    \ and spatial images are necessary for accurate\nScab detection in Rosaceae fruits,\
    \ so that features can be distinguished properly [44,45].\nMoreover, UAV platforms\
    \ also affect the sensors and dimensions of resolutions.\n4.5. Requisite of Segmentation\
    \ and Classiﬁcation\nThe UAV-captured data must have proper parameters such as\
    \ disease differentiation,\ndetection, and severity quantiﬁcation. Nevertheless,\
    \ these images possess huge and com-\nplex data. In most cases, mixed pixels of\
    \ soil or shadows are usually inevitable, which\nmakes the background disorganized\
    \ and noisy. Therefore, these images require multiple\noperations such as feature\
    \ extraction, segmentation, and classiﬁcation for accurate Scab\ndetection. The\
    \ segmentation is complicated if the target fruit, for example, green apple,\n\
    matches the color of the background [46]. If the part or features are not extracted\
    \ and\nsegmented properly, the classiﬁcation or Scab detection accuracy will decline,\
    \ which leads\nto incorrect disease identiﬁcation. Segmentation and classiﬁcation\
    \ are performed with\nDL models and algorithms. However, they cannot extract effective\
    \ features with too few\nconvolutional layers. To achieve satisfying outcomes,\
    \ CNN requires more convolutional\nlayers, which will exceed the computational\
    \ time and require a large training dataset and\nIoT system support [47].\n4.6.\
    \ Application Issues of UAVs\nFarmers and researchers have several concerns regarding\
    \ UAVs that give rise to user-\nacceptance issues [48]. Some reasons include handling\
    \ issues, privacy issues, security\nissues, permission issues, huge investments,\
    \ and other miscellaneous factors. Managing\nthe drones properly is not easy for\
    \ farmers; therefore, there is a risk of damage and injuries.\nIn [39], during\
    \ its ﬁrst ﬂight, the UAV became unresponsive due to mechanical failure.\nSimilarly,\
    \ they are concerned about the privacy of the captured data as well as cyber security\n\
    issues. The study reported in [49] emphasized the security analysis of drones.\
    \ It suggested\nthat security requirements vary according to the use case. Lightweight\
    \ hardware also was\nproposed in that it ensures the integrity and conﬁdentiality\
    \ of the data sent by the drone\nand the ground station. This hardware solution\
    \ proved to be a power-efﬁcient computation\nplatform; however, owing to extra\
    \ weight, its application was restricted. Additionally,\nthe high sensor dependency\
    \ and malware of drones along with the dynamic nature and\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n\
    9 of 32\ncomplexity of wireless communication networks were considered security\
    \ vulnerabilities\nfor the application of drones. In this study, global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) spooﬁng, data\ninterception, denial of service, malware infection,\
    \ the man-in-the-middle, wormholes, and\njammers were all detailed as possible\
    \ threats and attacks that jeopardize the security and\nreliability of drone communication.\n\
    Operating UAVs on farms requires special permission from regulating authorities.\n\
    Many authorities do not allow UAV integration due to several reasons [50]. For\
    \ example,\npermission was granted only after several days by Transport Canada\
    \ to deploy UAVs in\napple orchards [39]. Moreover, huge investments are essential\
    \ for advanced components\nand sensors for UAVs. Small-scale farmers are unable\
    \ to make such arrangements. Other\nmiscellaneous factors that negatively inﬂuence\
    \ its adoption include the location of farms,\ncompatibility of existing practices\
    \ with new and complex techniques, and others [51]. All\nthese challenges are\
    \ barriers to the application of UAVs for Scab identiﬁcation and other\nagricultural\
    \ purposes. More advanced and feasible solutions are essential to overcome\nthese\
    \ issues.\n5. Recent Methodologies to Overcome Challenges\nThis section describes\
    \ various trending methodologies that efﬁciently manage the\nhurdles of the abovementioned\
    \ challenges. All these evolving technologies are signiﬁcant\nfor accurate Scab\
    \ identiﬁcation even in the presence of symptom anomalies and for ex-\ntending\
    \ the capacities of UAV components along with ﬂight duration [52]. Additionally,\n\
    these approaches provide solutions to overcome the effects of forest attributes\
    \ on UAVs and\nimages, limitations of the sensors, and reduce the visibility issues\
    \ in images [53]. Moreover,\nsome developed algorithms and methods for better\
    \ segmentation and classiﬁcation of\ndatasets are evaluated in this section. Different\
    \ solutions that resolve the application issues\nof UAVs for agricultural purposes\
    \ are also detailed in this section.\n5.1. Advanced Approaches That Assist in\
    \ Scab Detection in the Presence of Symptom Anomalies\nand Laboratory Analysis\n\
    Diseases are ﬁrst identiﬁed based on symptoms which sometimes show relevancy or\n\
    sometimes show variances [44]. Therefore, detecting Scab disease in such cases\
    \ requires\nhigh-resolution images of fruits or leaves. In this context, the use\
    \ of UAVs with advanced\nsensors is a good option. These sensors not only capture\
    \ images with high spatial resolution,\nbut also give pure pixels of trees, parts\
    \ of trees, tissues, and pathogens. These mountable\nsensors, especially hyperspectral\
    \ ones, along with platform ﬂexibility have enabled UAVs\nto span leaf, plant,\
    \ and observation scales that beneﬁt the Scab detection process [54].\nConnected\
    \ and sensor-equipped smartphones are also advantageous in disease detection,\n\
    especially in the presence of symptom anomalies [55]. Different software in smartphones\n\
    performs the preprocessing of images. These smartphones can be deployed on UAVs\
    \ to\nassist not only in detecting anomalies but also to identify the location\
    \ of anomalies and\nreduce the transmission costs of sending the images to distant\
    \ laboratories for analysis. Fur-\nthermore, the recent DL techniques are capable\
    \ of identifying and differentiating a disease\ncorrectly with relevant or variable\
    \ symptoms. This advancement allows early detection of\nScab as well. Different\
    \ researchers applied hyperspectral or multispectral imaging with the\nDL techniques\
    \ to distinguish accurately the Scab diseases with anomalies of symptoms [56].\n\
    This combined approach analyzes and classiﬁes UAV-acquired images of fruits or\
    \ leaves\nwith higher accuracy. Moreover, this technique applies to both laboratory\
    \ analysis and\nUAV-based conditions. The severity of Scab disease can be measured\
    \ by determining the\ntotal diseased area of fruit or by calculating the amount\
    \ of disease penetration through\nquantiﬁcation methods.\n5.2. Evolving Techniques\
    \ That Extend the Capacity of UAV Components and Flight Duration\nWith progress\
    \ in technology, researchers are employing several methodologies to cope\nwith\
    \ payload or capacity issues of inbuilt components of UAVs [57]. The best solutions\
    \ are\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n10 of 32\nthe application of miniature sensors, ﬂying\
    \ at higher altitudes, usage of solar technology,\nsoftware-deﬁned storage, etc.\
    \ Sensor miniaturization solves the payload constraints. Flying\nat higher altitudes\
    \ or ﬂying in formation will not only limit the battery resource but also\nsaves\
    \ time. Replacing the usage of larger UAVs with solar energy-equipped UAVs enhances\n\
    the durability, power, and ﬂight time of UAVs to cover larger areas [55]. Moreover,\
    \ solar\npanels are lighter in weight, so they maintain the agility of UAVs by\
    \ ensuring that UAV is\nlightweight. Software-deﬁned storage such as cloud-based\
    \ data storage is a cost-effective\nsolution for in-built restricted capacity\
    \ with strong Internet signals [58]. Another option is\nvirtual storage, which\
    \ is also a low-cost solution for real-time applications. For example,\nBramor\
    \ UAVs utilize a high-speed Internet protocol (IP) link for transmitting and storing\n\
    data to its computing infrastructure, cloud computing, or ground control station\
    \ (GCS) [59].\nTo overcome the routing and strong Internet connections, researchers\
    \ are using wireless\nnetworking technologies such as the Fifth Generation (5G)\
    \ and smart Bluetooth [60]. All\nthese solutions excel in the performance and\
    \ ﬂying of UAVs.\n5.3. Recent Technologies That Handle Effects of Forest Attributes\n\
    Forests have different-sized trees, uneven terrain, and different climatic conditions\
    \ [61].\nAll these attributes affect the performance of UAVs and sensors. The\
    \ advances in UAVs and\nIoT devices have led to the development of an unmanned\
    \ aerial system (UAS) that is widely\napplied by numerous researchers. UASs provides\
    \ complete details regarding the features of\nindividual trees and analyzes the\
    \ surface topology and unevenness in forests [62]. Another\nsolution is the developed\
    \ architectures of UAVs with different regression models and\nartiﬁcial neural\
    \ network (ANN)-based models that forecast and update weather conditions.\nThis\
    \ real-time information enables UAVs to stay unaffected by all these factors.\
    \ Furthermore,\nit helps in operating UAVs safely without any damage or crashes.\
    \ With the evolving\ntechnology, various kinds of UAV platforms are progressing\
    \ that are signiﬁcant for larger\nﬁelds and forest deployments. For example, miniature\
    \ UAVs, which also called low-\naltitude platforms, are privileged to deploy in\
    \ forests because of their high mobility with\nless cost [63]. They can stay in\
    \ the air for a longer time, remaining unaffected by harsh\nclimatic conditions\
    \ and site conditions during takeoff. They easily retain the high spatial\nresolution\
    \ and reﬁne the measurement throughput. Another widely applied UAV platform\n\
    is a multirotor UAV that can ﬂy at different altitudes. It can ﬂy vertically as\
    \ well as\nhorizontally and needs a smaller space for landing and takeoff. An\
    \ optical sensor equipped\nwith it can easily capture clear three-dimensional\
    \ (3D) resolution images. The vertical\ntakeoff and landing (VTOL) system in UAVs\
    \ is a recent development that allows ease in\nmaneuvering [64]. VTOL UAVs also\
    \ remain unaffected by the attributes of forests and\nclimatic conditions. Moreover,\
    \ if image distortion is caused by platform tilt, position or\nvibration of UAVs,\
    \ uneven terrains or earth curvature, or other reasons, then geometric\ncorrection\
    \ can be applied to remove it.\n5.4. Advanced Sensors and Approaches That Reﬂect\
    \ Visibility in Images\nThe integration of sensors on a UAV depends upon their\
    \ application, size, and weight.\nThe widely applied advanced spectral sensors\
    \ are RGB, thermal, multispectral, hyperspec-\ntral, and light detection and ranging\
    \ (LiDAR) sensors [65]. Multispectral and RGB are\ncost-effective and provide\
    \ higher resolutions. Besides these optical sensors, researchers\nare using other\
    \ camera options as well that also show advantages. For example, the study\nreported\
    \ in [66] designed a cost-effective and ultralight UAV oblique photogrammetry\n\
    (OP) system using smartphones. Five digital cameras were removed from smartphones\n\
    and mounted on a UAV platform. This UAV OP system obtained images from different\n\
    angles and the results proved the accuracy and quality of the developed system.\
    \ Similarly,\nresearchers are focusing on using Meta optics for inexpensive and\
    \ small electro-optical\nsensors in miniature UAVs. Sometimes the UAV-obtained\
    \ images are not visible. As a\nsolution to this issue, ﬁxed-wing UAVs equipped\
    \ with fast shutter and speedy imaging\nsensors can be used [67]. This limits\
    \ the blurring issues while capturing images. Fur-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n11 of\
    \ 32\nthermore, advanced AI preprocessing methods can remove blur effects, visibility,\
    \ noise,\nand distortion issues in UAV-obtained images. These methods depend upon\
    \ the type and\nquality of an image. Some data preprocessing methods are spectral\
    \ calibration, atmospheric\ncalibration, and geometric correction [68]. These\
    \ approaches are signiﬁcant in removing\nerrors. Spectral calibration employs\
    \ complex techniques such as spectral interpolation,\nspectral normalization,\
    \ and radiation transfer models. Atmospheric calibration helps to\nreduce surface\
    \ reﬂectivity errors that are due to atmospheric absorption and scattering.\n\
    Geometric correction removes distortion in images, as discussed above. Moreover,\
    \ image\nenhancement, spectral smoothing, and data ﬁltering techniques can be\
    \ applied to remove\ndisorganized and noisy data by highlighting the targeted\
    \ characteristics [69]. Spectral\nsmoothing techniques include Savitzky–Golay\
    \ smoothing, minimum noise-fraction rota-\ntion, moving average smoothing, and\
    \ others. Data ﬁltering techniques include Gaussian\nﬁltering, linear ﬁltering,\
    \ etc. Image enhancement techniques include homomorphic ﬁltering,\nhistogram equalization,\
    \ and others.\n5.5. Recent Methodologies That Allow Effective Segmentation and\
    \ Accurate Classiﬁcation\nSegmentation and feature extraction processes are essential\
    \ for UAV-generated im-\nages [19]. These processes organize the data following\
    \ discriminative information. The\ncommonly applied techniques for segmentation\
    \ are thresholding, region-based, edge-based,\nclustering-based, and neural network\
    \ (NN)-based methods [70]. Gray-level co-occurrence\nmatrix (GLCM), principal\
    \ component analysis (PCA), discrete wavelet transforms (DWT),\nand NN-based models\
    \ used extensively for feature extraction [71]. All these approaches\nenable classiﬁcation\
    \ with accuracy. Technological advancements have developed many\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ algorithms and models that categorize diseases efﬁciently, accurately, and\n\
    rapidly. ML classiﬁers are widely applied for the classiﬁcation of diseases and\
    \ early detec-\ntion [72]. These classiﬁers are rooted in image segmentation and\
    \ feature extraction. The\nCNN models are the current approaches for solving the\
    \ data complexity and removing\nnoisy and disorganized backgrounds in images.\
    \ The deep convolutional neural network\n(DCNN) model achieves higher than 90%\
    \ accuracy and the multilayer convolutional neu-\nral network (MCNN) achieves\
    \ more than 95% accuracy in many kinds of research while\nclassifying healthy\
    \ and diseased leaves appropriately [73]. Moreover, these can identify\nmultiple\
    \ diseases. Current studies have employed semi supervised classiﬁcation methods\n\
    for creating more diverse images [74]. This reduces the discrepancy in dataset\
    \ accuracy.\nAn extensive description of recent techniques of segmentation, feature\
    \ extraction, and\nclassiﬁcation processes is provided in the next sections.\n\
    5.6. Solutions That Address the Application Issues of UAVs\nThe reasons that hinder\
    \ the application of UAVs are user-acceptance issues, handling\nissues, safety\
    \ issues, privacy issues, security issues, permission issues, the need for huge\n\
    investments, and other miscellaneous factors [4]. There are numerous solutions\
    \ to address\nthese application issues. As an example, developments of Android\
    \ applications provide\nease in operating UAVs and ensure safety for farmers [75].\
    \ These applications connect with\nthe farmers via a Bluetooth module, which is\
    \ embedded in the UAVs. Gyro, accelerome-\nter, and magnetometer help in managing\
    \ the balance, aerial stability, and orientation of\nUAVs [76]. Intel has developed\
    \ efﬁcient and low-cost Bluetooth-interfaced UAV structures\nthat avoid collisions\
    \ and ensure safety from equipment damage [77]. This framework\nprovides wireless\
    \ communications among all the UAVs and shares data about their current\nlocation,\
    \ direction, altitude, and speed. The Bluetooth technology adaptation is highly\n\
    beneﬁcial, gives higher efﬁciency, and is cost-effective. Similarly, smartphones\
    \ equipped\nwith cameras and GPS sensors are promising tools for farmers [78].\
    \ Smartphones, being\naffordable and easy to use, are a better option to overcome\
    \ the handling and security issues\nfor farmers. Another solution is the merger\
    \ of formal techniques with ML techniques\nthat develops dependable learning-enabled\
    \ systems. This merger provides excellent per-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n12 of 32\n\
    formance with the assurance of safety and security of systems through a speciﬁcation\n\
    language [79]. Moreover, formal methods verify the application of AI techniques\
    \ [80].\nAI manages all the data security issues, especially those that are evoked\
    \ in trans-\nferring data. ANN-based approaches, blockchain, mobile edge computing\
    \ (MEC), and\nphysically unclonable function (PUF) schemes are the security countermeasures\
    \ against\ncyberattacks [81]. These schemes protect the integrity and conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data. Another\nstudy [82] analyzed threats and attacks as the risks of cybersecurity\
    \ and proposes ML\ntechniques, blockchain, software-deﬁned networks (SDN), and\
    \ fog computing as coun-\ntermeasures. Additionally, a combination of the CNN\
    \ model and the Internet of drones\n(IoD) is advantageous [83]. This study uses\
    \ wireless communication technology that de-\nvelops a more optimized system security\
    \ for the model and suggests that the clustering\nalgorithm developed on node\
    \ energy gives the best performance. Another study [84] solves\nthe security and\
    \ communication issues by designing an authentication protocol over the\nFifth\
    \ Generation (5G) technology. This enhanced protocol provides better security\
    \ and\nresists privileged insider attacks, impersonation attacks, drone capture\
    \ attacks, mutual\nauthentication, user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, tempo-\nrary information disclosure attacks, and untrace ability. Furthermore,\
    \ nations are slowly\nmaking transitions from “banning” to “guiding” policies.\
    \ The management measures\nalso show development from various aspects. The recent\
    \ efforts of regulatory authorities\nand local governments serve a pioneering\
    \ role in composing management regulations for\nUAVs [85]. Smartphone applications\
    \ allow paperless work, and communication between\nfarmers, ofﬁcials, and researchers,\
    \ and provide the solution to farming issues [86]. This\nstudy presents an analysis\
    \ of the apps developed by Indian governmental institutes. Trend-\ning methodologies\
    \ are developing budget-friendly UAVs and related equipment. UAV\nimagery provides\
    \ automatic and rapid analysis of forests and farms that reduces project\ncosts.\
    \ Instead of employing labor, expensive surveying tools, and heavy machinery,\
    \ this\ntechnology produces data with higher accuracy and less expense. Moreover,\
    \ UAVs can\nfrequently survey farms for monitoring purposes that provide the current\
    \ growth and con-\ndition of trees and reduces the chances of Scab and other diseases.\
    \ This also prevents food\nand economic losses. UAVs are environmentally friendly.\
    \ Most of the UAVs have electric\nmotors so they use no fossil fuels while some\
    \ use fewer fossil fuels; in both cases, they\nproduce no or negligible greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions. Furthermore, UAV imagery improves\nthe environmental conditions\
    \ that hugely contribute to the sustainable development of\nagriculture. All these\
    \ solutions will lead to user-acceptance and extensive application of\nUAVs. Table\

    \ Extraction Techniques in Image Analysis of Rosaceae Fruits\nIn Scab disease\
    \ detection using UAVs, feature extraction is considered one of the\nprime pillars\
    \ [87]. Essential information and features are predetermined in this phase.\n\
    These isolated features are combined and optimized to form new feature vectors\
    \ and then\nforwarded for the classiﬁcation process. The extraction techniques\
    \ improve the accuracy of\nthe classiﬁcation and allow efﬁcient Scab detection.\
    \ Moreover, feature extraction secures the\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n14 of 32\nspectral\
    \ information and operates dimension reduction in hyperspectral data images [88].\n\
    The processing features are extracted according to the study. A study in [89]\
    \ used the\nsped-up robust feature (SURF) technique to extract desired regions\
    \ of interest from a\nsegmented image of an apple. Three widely focused visual\
    \ contents: shape, color, and\ntexture, were extracted by various techniques [87].\
    \ Binary image algorithms and horizontal\nand vertical segmentation were applied\
    \ for shape extraction. The histogram intersection\n(HI) method, Zernike chromaticity\
    \ distribution moments, and color histogram are color\nextraction methods. Similarly,\
    \ the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), edge detection,\nand texture–law\
    \ measures are some texture extraction approaches [90].\nCertain techniques are\
    \ used to extract a single feature while some techniques are\ncapable in extracting\
    \ multiple features [45]. The GLCM approach extracts grayscale global\nfeatures.\
    \ Similarly, for color edge detection, binary quaternion-moment-preserving (BQMP)\n\
    can be applied. BQMP uses a histogram to show regions of an image with certain\
    \ colors.\nFor size, distance, and location extraction, a spatial gray-level dependence\
    \ matrix can\nbe employed. Histogram of gradients (HOG) is a fast feature extraction\
    \ method. ML\ntechniques play a signiﬁcant role in extracting multiple and deep\
    \ features [44]. To obtain a\ndeep learning network, CNN architectures are optimal\
    \ solutions. These models comprise\ntwo signiﬁcant functions, namely convolution\
    \ and pooling, which detect pattern edges\nand reduce the image sizes. Classic\
    \ CNN, InceptionV3, AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG are\nthe commonly applied architectures\
    \ for visual feature extraction [91]. Table 3 provides an\nanalysis of different\
    \ studies that employed these techniques for Scab detection in Rosaceae\nfamily\

    After image acquisition, proper analysis of imagery data is essential and uses\
    \ image\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation techniques [45]. Image segmentation is\
    \ the process of split-\nting a digital image into components that give meaningful\
    \ data. It is a process of assigning\nan object class to every single pixel of\
    \ an image. It provides complete details of all the object\nclasses in an image.\
    \ Different approaches for segmentation are thresholding, edge-based,\nregion-based,\
    \ watershed, clustering-based, and neural networks-based methods [101].\n7.1.1.\
    \ Thresholding Segmentation\nThe segmentation technique that works on the histogram\
    \ features of an image and\nhelps to segment images containing bright objects\
    \ or patches is known as thresholding [102].\nThis technique transforms a colored\
    \ or grayscale image into a binary (black and white)\nimage that helps in further\
    \ processes and minimizes difﬁculties. The thresholding process\ncan be global,\
    \ local, and dynamic based on gray levels and neighborhood attributes [46]. In\n\
    disease detection, it proves to be the simplest and ideal for real-time segmentation\
    \ but can\nbe inﬂuenced by noise.\n7.1.2. Edge-Based Segmentation\nEdge-based\
    \ segmentation techniques are based on marking discontinuities of numer-\nous\
    \ factors such as colors, gray levels, and others [103]. These techniques blend\
    \ detected\nedges into edge chains for constructing borders or object boundaries.\
    \ Some operators for\nedge detection are Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Laplacian,\
    \ Marr–Hilclrath, and Canny [104].\nIn Scab detection, these approaches perform\
    \ segmentation on images that possess better\ncontrast among objects. However,\
    \ in some cases, these methods give false edges that reduce\nthe detection accuracy.\n\
    7.1.3. Region-Based Segmentation\nRegion-based segmentation techniques group together\
    \ pixels that possess identical\nfeatures for producing homogeneous regions in\
    \ an image [105]. Gray levels of pixels are\nthe widely used criteria for homogeneities.\
    \ These segmentations are further classiﬁed into\nregion mergers, region splits,\
    \ and splits and mergers [106]. The main advantage of these\nmethods is they can\
    \ easily deﬁne similarity criteria and remain unaffected due to noise.\n7.1.4.\
    \ Watershed Segmentation\nAnother widely applied region-based method for segmentation\
    \ is watershed segmen-\ntation [107]. The watersheds are the lines that decompose\
    \ an image by dividing water areas\ninto catchment basins. Moreover, watersheds\
    \ keep these basins apart and assign every\nsingle pixel to a watershed or a region\
    \ [108]. It gives faster and more accurate segmentation\nwith complete image division\
    \ but sometimes results in excessive segmentation and is\nsensitive to noise.\n\
    7.1.5. Clustering-Based Segmentation\nClustering-based segmentation uses unsupervised\
    \ cluster algorithms. Fuzzy C-means\nand K-means approaches are commonly applied.\
    \ Fuzzy C-means provide soft and K-means\nhard segmentation results. The main\
    \ goal of clustering is to use unlabeled training data\nfor creating decision\
    \ boundaries [89]. The prime advantages of clustering-based methods\nare their\
    \ easy application and disease detection, but they need to deﬁne the k-value of\
    \ the\ncluster and do not give the optimum answer in a few Scab detection studies.\n\
    7.1.6. Neural Networks for Segmentation\nNeural network (NN) is a supervised segmentation\
    \ method [109]. ANN algorithms\nare widely applied for segmentation purposes both\
    \ in unsupervised and supervised modes.\nANN-based models contain an enormous\
    \ number of processing elements that are intercon-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n16 of\
    \ 32\nnected and work together for solving speciﬁc issues. These models can learn\
    \ adaptively,\npossess self-organizing capabilities, and solve complex problems.\
    \ However, these models\nneed to train before segmentation application and require\
    \ more time for it.\n7.1.7. Analysis of Various Segmentation Approaches for Scab\
    \ Detection\nTable 4 represents an evaluation of image segmentation techniques\
    \ for detecting\nScab disease in Rosaceae fruits by various researchers. We collected\
    \ the segmentation\nmethods that have been used from 2019 to 2022. This literature\
    \ review comprises some\ntraditional segmentation methods and the widely used\
    \ NN-based methods in recent times.\nThe traditional methods effectively extract\
    \ the appropriate data and objects from the\nbackground, whereas NN-based models\
    \ perform binary and multiclass segmentation tasks\nsuccessfully, identify minor\
    \ spots effectively, predict disease with higher accuracy and\nprovide robust\
    \ results on validation datasets.\nTable 4. Analysis of different segmentation\

    The process to identify and mark vectors or pixel groups in an image following\
    \ distinct\ncriteria is called classiﬁcation [123]. Classiﬁcation law depends\
    \ upon the usage of single\nor multiple spectral bands features, for example,\
    \ color, shape, texture, etc. Figure 3 shows\nan evaluation for the segmentation\
    \ of interested regions and classiﬁcation of diseases in\npeaches using mask R-CNN\
    \ [35]. The categorization of classiﬁers is based on various rules\nsuch as parametric\
    \ and nonparametric, object-based, and pixel-based. Supervised and\nunsupervised\
    \ methods are the two broad assortments of these classiﬁers [124].\nDrones 2023,\
    \ 7, 97\n17 of 32\nDrones 2023, 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n18  of  34 \n \n \nFigure 3. Mask R‐CNN for classification. \n\
    7.2.1. Unsupervised Classification Method: \nUnsupervised classification is a fully automated approach that does not require train‐\n\
    ing samples by its user [123]. The user selects the algorithm for the software and desig‐\n\
    nates the number of output classes for image classification. The software groups the pixels \n\
    based on the feature similarity into classes in a systematic way. It employs pattern recog‐\n\
    nition or clustering. The commonly applied unsupervised classifiers are K‐means cluster‐\n\
    ing, iterative self‐organizing data analysis techniques (ISODATA), hierarchical clustering, \n\
    self‐organizing map (SOM), etc. \ni. \nK‐Means Clustering: K‐means clustering is one of the simple and widely applied clus‐\n\
    tering algorithms for classification [124]. In K‐means clustering, a dataset is split into \n\
    several clusters. Among all the clusters, a minimum of one component must possess \n\
    the image of the principal space of the diseased component [125]. The major drawback \n\
    is the users are restricted to defining the number of clusters for image classification of \n\
    diseased fruits. \nii. \nIterative Self‐Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA): ISODATA is another \n\
    category of unsupervised classifiers [126]. Two parameters strongly influence the clas‐\n\
    sification results. These parameters are the distance threshold that is required for clus‐\n\
    ter union and the typical deviation threshold that is required for cluster deviation. \n\
    ISODATA allows good classification in Scab detection and visual interpretation of \n\
    feature differences in images but shows rare missing point errors. \niii. \nHierarchical Clustering: Another simple unsupervised classifier like K‐means is hier‐\n\
    archical clustering. The only difference is that the number of clusters is not fixed and \n\
    changes in all the iterations. This is further categorized into agglomerative clustering \n\
    and divisive clustering [127]. The prime reasons for using this clustering in disease \n\
    detection are its easy implementation and no requirement for advanced specification \n\
    of the number of clusters. However, it experiences slow classification and does not \n\
    classify well in images having outliers and noise. \n7.2.2. Supervised Classification Method \n\
    Supervised classification allows the user to choose a set of sample pixels, represent‐\n\
    ing classes, in an image and instructs the software to utilize them as references for other \n\
    pixel classifications within that image [128]. The user designates which similar spectral \n\
    features are essential for grouping input data and assigns the number of classes for image \n\
    classification. The widely used supervised classifiers are k‐nearest neighbor (KNN), sup‐\n\
    port vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forest (RF), and deep \n\
    learning (DL) models [129]. All these classifiers achieve high accuracy. Some are discussed \n\
    below: \nFigure 3. Mask R-CNN for classiﬁcation.\n7.2.1. Unsupervised Classiﬁcation\
    \ Method:\nUnsupervised classiﬁcation is a fully automated approach that does\
    \ not require train-\ning samples by its user [125]. The user selects the algorithm\
    \ for the software and designates\nthe number of output classes for image classiﬁcation.\
    \ The software groups the pixels based\non the feature similarity into classes\
    \ in a systematic way. It employs pattern recognition or\nclustering. The commonly\
    \ applied unsupervised classiﬁers are K-means clustering, iterative\nself-organizing\
    \ data analysis techniques (ISODATA), hierarchical clustering, self-organizing\n\
    map (SOM), etc.\ni.\nK-Means Clustering: K-means clustering is one of the simple\
    \ and widely applied\nclustering algorithms for classiﬁcation [126]. In K-means\
    \ clustering, a dataset is\nsplit into several clusters. Among all the clusters,\
    \ a minimum of one component\nmust possess the image of the principal space of\
    \ the diseased component [127]. The\nmajor drawback is the users are restricted\
    \ to deﬁning the number of clusters for\nimage classiﬁcation of diseased fruits.\n\
    ii.\nIterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA): ISODATA is\
    \ an-\nother category of unsupervised classiﬁers [128]. Two parameters strongly\
    \ inﬂuence\nthe classiﬁcation results. These parameters are the distance threshold\
    \ that is re-\nquired for cluster union and the typical deviation threshold that\
    \ is required for\ncluster deviation. ISODATA allows good classiﬁcation in Scab\
    \ detection and visual\ninterpretation of feature differences in images but shows\
    \ rare missing point errors.\niii.\nHierarchical Clustering: Another simple unsupervised\
    \ classiﬁer like K-means is\nhierarchical clustering. The only difference is that\
    \ the number of clusters is not ﬁxed\nand changes in all the iterations. This\
    \ is further categorized into agglomerative\nclustering and divisive clustering\
    \ [129]. The prime reasons for using this clustering\nin disease detection are\
    \ its easy implementation and no requirement for advanced\nspeciﬁcation of the\
    \ number of clusters. However, it experiences slow classiﬁcation\nand does not\
    \ classify well in images having outliers and noise.\n7.2.2. Supervised Classiﬁcation\
    \ Method\nSupervised classiﬁcation allows the user to choose a set of sample pixels,\
    \ representing\nclasses, in an image and instructs the software to utilize them\
    \ as references for other pixel\nclassiﬁcations within that image [130]. The user\
    \ designates which similar spectral features\nare essential for grouping input\
    \ data and assigns the number of classes for image classiﬁca-\ntion. The widely\
    \ used supervised classiﬁers are k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector\nmachine\
    \ (SVM), logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forest (RF), and deep learning\n\
    (DL) models [131]. All these classiﬁers achieve high accuracy. Some are discussed\
    \ below:\ni.\nK-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): The simplest among all supervised classiﬁcation\
    \ meth-\nods is the k-nearest neighbor rule [132]. It requires selecting k, the\
    \ number of\nneighbors essential for classiﬁcation. The KNN classiﬁer is not commonly\
    \ used\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n18 of 32\nalone because it requires associated visualization;\
    \ however, it may be applied as a\nbaseline classiﬁer for comparison with other\
    \ classiﬁers [133]. The main advantage\nis it is simple and easily applicable\
    \ for small datasets and uses less time for training\nbut shows higher computational\
    \ complexity.\nii.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM): SVM selects extreme points for\
    \ producing a hyper-\nplane [134]. A hyperplane is the best decision boundary\
    \ that causes n-dimensional\nspace segregation into appropriate classes. Earlier\
    \ SVM was applicable for binary\nclassiﬁcation only, but now it is modiﬁed to\
    \ perform multiclass classiﬁcation [135].\nThe other key advantages of SVM are\
    \ that it is robust, provides simple geometric\ninterpretations, and shows low\
    \ computational cost. Some drawbacks are the need\nfor large support vectors and\
    \ slow training.\niii.\nLogistic Regression: Despite its name, logistic regression\
    \ is a powerful supervised\nclassiﬁer instead of a regression model [136]. It\
    \ applied for predictive analysis. It\nis developed on probability notion and\
    \ sigmoid function. This classiﬁer is appli-\ncable for linear and binary classiﬁcation\
    \ [36]. It is a simple, easy-to-realize, and\na more efﬁcient classiﬁcation method\
    \ for disease detection in plants. Neverthe-\nless, it is restricted to giving\
    \ only linear solutions and requires the compilation of\ndata assumptions.\niv.\n\
    Naïve Bayes: A probabilistic classiﬁer formed on the Bayes theorem is called naïve\n\
    Bayes [137]. It assumes that all the features being independent have no interactions\n\
    among them. Being simple in application and fast in computation, it gives better\n\
    performance for large datasets [138]. Therefore, it can be used for real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions also. However, in some cases classiﬁcation accuracy is reduced\
    \ due to class\nconditional independence.\nv.\nRandom Forest (RF): Another supervised\
    \ classiﬁer is random forest, which classiﬁes\nlarge data accurately [139]. It\
    \ uses an ensemble apprenticeship approach for training\nand sums up the prediction\
    \ results of individual trees. Unlike other decision tree\nalgorithms, RF does\
    \ not utilize proﬁt knowledge [140]. It acts as a tree predictor and\nso helps\
    \ in assorting trees randomly in forests. In image classiﬁcation of diseased\n\
    plants, RF handles large databases efﬁciently and estimates signiﬁcant variables.\n\
    However, it results in excessive ﬁtting in some cases due to noise.\nvi.\nDeep\
    \ Learning (DL): The subset of machine learning (ML), in which a computer\nmodel\
    \ imitates human biological learning, is called deep learning (DL) [141]. It\n\
    contains multiple processing layers such as ANNs rather than classical neural\n\
    networks. It includes all the steps, data acquisition, classiﬁcation, and results\n\
    evaluation. The most applied neural network (NN) is an artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN) [142]. It is an image-learning and classiﬁcation tool. NN models perform\n\
    activities identical to human brains. While knowing previous data, these models\
    \ are\ntrained to work on related data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\
    \ recurrent\nneural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs)\
    \ are some\ncommonly applied ANN models [143]. These models need fewer formal\
    \ statistics,\nefﬁciently manage noisy data, and give higher accuracy in Scab\
    \ detection, but tend\ntoward excessive ﬁtting due to many layers and huge computations.\n\
    7.3. Analysis of Various Classiﬁcation Approaches\nThis section provides a comprehensive\
    \ analysis of various classiﬁcation algorithms\nand models used by numerous researchers\
    \ for Scab detection in Rosaceae fruits. The\nmodels are developed with deep,\
    \ complex, and high parameters to achieve high accuracy\nwith a limitation of\
    \ complex computation. VGGNet, InceptionV3, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,\nand XceptionNet\
    \ are widely used DL models [144]. Some models are developed to achieve\ncomputation\
    \ efﬁciency with a restriction of adequate accuracy. These models work ef-\nﬁciently\
    \ on mobiles like ResNet. [145] applied several ML and DL methods for disease\n\
    detection and the result showed that VGG16 achieved the highest classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy.\nThis evaluated that the number of layers in the NN model indicates\
    \ the network complexity\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n19 of 32\nand too many layers may\
    \ affect the results. Table 5 provides a detailed analysis of the\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ used by scholars for image analysis.\nTable 5. Classiﬁcation techniques for\

    Drones 2023, 7, 97\n21 of 32\n8. Utilization of UAV in Scab Detection\nUAVs are\
    \ categorized into ﬁxed-wing UAVs, rotary-wing UAVs, and vertical takeoff\nand\
    \ landing (VTOL) according to their ﬂight platforms [159]. The payload is designed\n\
    according to the task requirement and better functions are achieved with the sacriﬁce\
    \ of\ncertain performances. UAVs have many beneﬁts with a few limitations. Owing\
    \ to this\nreason, UAVs of different platforms and payloads are employed for different\
    \ purposes.\nSome imaging sensors that are essential for UAVs in plant monitoring\
    \ and Scab detection\nare explained below.\nImaging Sensors Required for UAV Monitoring\n\
    Whenever we focus on applications of UAVs in any ﬁeld, one of the foremost factors\n\
    that we consider is the kind and quality of the sensor for aerial imaging. The\
    \ nature\nof research, the type of sensor, and the required image quality decide\
    \ the selection of a\nUAV platform. These imaging sensors work on the conversion\
    \ principle of light rays into\nelectrical signals. The widely applied sensors\
    \ for acquiring images in agriculture are RGB,\nnear-infrared (NIR), multispectral,\
    \ hyperspectral, thermal, and depth sensors. The optical\nfeatures of sensors\
    \ along with electromagnetic ranges are important factors for detecting\nplant\
    \ diseases [141].\ni.\nRGB (Red–Green–Blue) Sensors: RGB spectral sensors are\
    \ the visible light sources\nthat are commonly used. These sensors measure only\
    \ the intensities of three colors\nand evaluate each in every pixel. The naked\
    \ eye is sensitive to three color bands:\nred, blue, and green; therefore, the\
    \ RGB sensor gives images that can be easily\nrecognized by humans. These sensors\
    \ are utilized with other sensors to improve\ntheir accuracy. If a red ﬁlter replaces\
    \ a NIR ﬁlter, then it is named modiﬁed RGB.\nThese sensors are the least expensive\
    \ and are easily available but give low spectral\nresolution images. These capture\
    \ images with high spatial resolution and allow\nﬁner spatial details. These can\
    \ formulate 3D models of plants and can be used\nfor plant inspection in harsh\
    \ weather. Moreover, RGB images give details on LAB\nwhere L stands for lightness\
    \ and AB are dimensions of the color opponent, YCBCR\nwhere Y stands for the luma\
    \ component, CB and CR are the blue difference and\nred difference, Hue, Saturation,\
    \ and Value (HSV), and others [160]. These help\nin identifying diseases in plant\
    \ leaves and fruits. However, their spectral range\nvaries from 380 to 750 nm\
    \ only, and this range cannot be used to identify diseases\nappropriately.\nii.\n\
    Multispectral Sensors: Multispectral sensors are capable in capturing images having\n\
    exceptional spatial resolution and determine reﬂectance in the infrared (IR) bands.\n\
    These sensors use various spectral bands such as red, blue, green, NIR, and red-edge.\n\
    Multiple bands in these sensors give high accuracy. These are classiﬁed into two\n\
    groups according to bandwidth: broadband sensors and narrowband sensors. These\n\
    allow appropriate analytics for agriculture; therefore, these are highly crucial\
    \ for\nresearchers and farmers. Multispectral together with NIR sensors form vegetable\n\
    indices (VI) that rely either on NIR or other light bands [161]. For automatic\
    \ disease\ndetection, multispectral sensors capture images in both regions, namely\
    \ visible and\nNIR. The absence of multispectral data would hinder early disease\
    \ detection, pests\nand weed detection, and vegetation biomass calculation of\
    \ plants. The drawbacks\nof these sensors are high cost and enhanced calibration\
    \ efforts for certain tasks [53].\niii.\nHyperspectral Sensors: The extremely\
    \ capable hyperspectral images can capture\nimages in spatial and spectral ranges.\
    \ These sensors collect light with multiple\nnarrow-size bands for every single\
    \ pixel in the captured image. Furthermore, these\nsensors have area detectors\
    \ for quantifying the captured light that resulted from\nthe incident photon conversion\
    \ into electrons [77]. This conversion is obtained\nthrough two sensors, namely,\
    \ charge-coupled-device (CCD) sensors along with\ncomplementary metal-oxide–semiconductor\
    \ (CMOS) sensors. These sensors are\nused for minimizing the shortcomings of multispectral\
    \ sensors, for capturing infor-\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n22 of 32\nmation in lesser\
    \ spectral differences, and for detecting and discriminating against\ntarget objects.\
    \ The commercial success of these sensors in UAVs to measure a\nhundred bands\
    \ and perform data processing is guaranteed. The prime advantage\nof these sensors\
    \ in agriculture is that they can detect plant stress with the disease\nor pathogen\
    \ responsible for it. Major limitations include higher costs and huge\nunnecessary\
    \ data if not properly calibrated [162].\niv.\nThermal Sensors: Thermal sensors\
    \ capture the thermal energy of an object through\noptical lenses and IR sensors\
    \ ﬁt in thermal sensors, which data are then used to\ngenerate images with the\
    \ information collected. These sensors detect the radiation\nrelated to their\
    \ wavelengths and generate heat while converting these radiations\ninto grayscale\
    \ images. Furthermore, they can generate colored images with yellow\nrepresenting\
    \ warmer images and blue representing cooler images [163]. Their costs\nare relatively\
    \ low and RGB sensors with a few modiﬁcations can be converted\ninto thermal sensors.\
    \ These sensors are widely used for agricultural tasks such as\ndisease detection,\
    \ irrigation management, mapping, and monitoring. These sensors\ngenerate images\
    \ with comparatively low resolution and huge data, which is their\nmajor drawback\
    \ [123].\nv.\nDepth Sensors: Depth sensors allow an extra depth of features in\
    \ RGB pixels. The\ndepth is the distance between an object and the depth sensor\
    \ when the image is\ncaptured. These are widely equipped on UAVs for agricultural\
    \ purposes and are\nused to enhance the accuracy of other sensors. LiDAR, red–green–blue–depth\
    \ (RGB-\nD), and time of ﬂight (ToF) are some depth sensors. Light detection and\
    \ ranging\n(LiDAR) is considered the most prevalent depth sensor. The prime difference\
    \ be-\ntween LiDAR and RGB-D is that LiDAR implies laser pulses for distance calculation\n\
    whereas RGB-D is dependent on the light reﬂection intensities [164]. Therefore,\n\
    LiDAR is used more than RGB-D for 3D modeling, disease detection, phenotyping,\n\
    etc. The major drawback is that sometimes these sensors provide lower intensity\n\
    counts as these cannot detect objects after a speciﬁc distance.\nWe list the 2017–2022\
    \ studies in Table 6. This table illustrates different imaging sensors\nand UAV\
    \ types, and their achieved beneﬁts for detecting Scab in Rosaceae fruits and\
    \ other\nfruits. Some prime advantages of using UAVs equipped with sensors are\
    \ accurate and pre-\ncise results in Scab detection, early detection, and monitoring\
    \ of health and growth in plants.\nThese advanced technologies not only save crops\
    \ and time but also enhance production.\nTable 6. Advantages of sensors for acquiring\

    This manuscript discusses UAV imagery for image acquisition and various AI tech-\n\
    niques for image processing for Scab detection in Rosaceae family fruits. Challenges\
    \ in\nScab detection and the recent methodologies to address them are evaluated.\
    \ Miniature\nand high-resolution sensors with ﬂexible UAV platforms, IoT-based\
    \ data storage, solar\ntechnology for batteries, and DL approaches proved to be\
    \ the best solutions to cope with\nthe stated challenges. Employing NN-based models\
    \ for color, shape, and texture extraction\nseparates the infected areas, improves\
    \ the noise robustness and visualization, and enhances\nthe classiﬁcation accuracy.\
    \ Reviewing all the segmentation methods, CNN-based models,\nespecially Mask R-CNN,\
    \ SegNet, and UNet, perform binary and multiclass segmenta-\ntion tasks successfully,\
    \ detect accurate pixel boundaries and minor spots, separate the\npotentially\
    \ Scab-diseased areas, and enhance the identiﬁcation accuracy. Similarly, the\n\
    supervised classiﬁcation methods categorize the healthy and the diseased leaves\
    \ in their\nDrones 2023, 7, 97\n24 of 32\nrespective classes appropriately. Among\
    \ them, CNN-based architectures, namely classic\nCNN, VGG, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3,\
    \ outperform other ML and CNN models by\nrestricting operation, complexity, size,\
    \ and other parameters, allowing quick convolution\nand detecting Scab with higher\
    \ accuracy, precision, and G-measure. Being fast and ef-\nﬁcient, UAVs show outstanding\
    \ application prospects in image acquisition of Rosaceae\nfruits among other devices.\
    \ A comparative study of various research shows rotary-wing\nUAVs are extensively\
    \ used for Scab detection; therefore, they are better adapted for use in\nagricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. Different sensors are observed to be utilized, but all these sensors\
    \ have\nmany beneﬁts along with restrictions. Depth sensors are not observed to\
    \ be commonly\nexploited because of their expense. Sections of segmentation, classiﬁcation,\
    \ and sensors\nhave relevant conclusions; thus, it is evident that the fusion\
    \ of AI with UAV imagery has\nthe potential to close the gap between recent trends\
    \ and disease detection.\n9.2. Conclusions\nScab disease in fruits causes food\
    \ insecurity and economic loss. However, Scab detec-\ntion is still challenging\
    \ among researchers and farmers. This manuscript gives preliminary\ninsight into\
    \ the selection of state-of-the-art UAV-based and AI-based techniques for Scab\n\
    detection in Rosaceae family fruits. This paper presents challenging issues associated\
    \ with\nScab detection via UAV imagery and current methodologies that resolve\
    \ these challenges.\nFrom the perspective of an organized framework, it categorizes\
    \ all of the current method-\nologies into three sections, namely feature extraction,\
    \ segmentation and classiﬁcation, and\nUAV imagery. Additionally, an extensive\
    \ literature review is given in all these sections\nalong with the signiﬁcance\
    \ and limitations of each study. In the end, this paper describes\nsome challenges\
    \ that still require further integration efforts to optimize UAV applications\n\
    for Scab detection. This will help UAV imagery to reach milestones in disease\
    \ detection\nand economic stability.\n10. Challenges with Future Prospects\nWith\
    \ technological advancement, certain challenges still require modiﬁcations. In\n\
    this section, we highlight some issues and opportunities of current approaches\
    \ that need\nconsideration in the future. Automation aspects from image acquisition\
    \ to data processing,\ninterpretation, and disease detection will enhance the\
    \ utility of technology. Proper detection\nof diseases with minimal error will\
    \ be possible with better images generated by lightweight\nUAVs and high-resolution\
    \ sensors. Such UAV systems are required that can serve as\nrotary-wing and ﬁxed-wing\
    \ UAVs simultaneously according to the requirement. Enhanced\nﬂight duration and\
    \ reduced costs still require solutions for efﬁciently assessing the overall\n\
    plant status at larger farms and in forests. This will be possible with energy-efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwireless charging systems. Platforms must be capable to alter their speed\
    \ and altitude to\nmanage climatic conditions. Additionally, 3D ﬂight paths will\
    \ be a better option to address\nthe inconsistency in sampling distance from the\
    \ ground.\nMultiple sensors interfaced on combined platforms will be capable to\
    \ reduce payload\nand measure a variety of physiological parameters. The selection\
    \ of sensors and their\nspectral range is aided by the nature of the disease.\
    \ The wider the spectral ranges, the\nbetter will be the differentiation of disease\
    \ symptoms. The image suffers from reﬂections\nand shadows if they are captured\
    \ during daylight. Illumination backscatter X-ray imaging\nneeds to be controlled.\
    \ The low resolution of sensors reﬂects thermal radiation, which\nrequires careful\
    \ calibration of sensors. Accurate thermography will assist thermal sen-\nsors\
    \ in measuring real and accurate temperatures. Furthermore, huge and complex data\n\
    generated by UAVs still require advanced data analysis software. The advanced\
    \ coding\nand data training, and maintenance of this software must be considered\
    \ in the future.\nMoreover, ML algorithms give more accurate results for larger\
    \ datasets, but overcoming\nthe insufﬁciency of larger training and validation\
    \ datasets needs to be developed. All of\nthese expansions will make these technologies\
    \ user-friendly and highly and universally\nadaptable for disease detection.\n\

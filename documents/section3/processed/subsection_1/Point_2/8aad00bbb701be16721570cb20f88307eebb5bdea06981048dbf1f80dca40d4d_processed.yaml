    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes

    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    able to perceive, access, and even control. By connecting various “Things” to the Internet, the IoT makes\n\
    it possible to measure and manage the physical world as needed. As one of the most widely adopted Low\n\
    Power Wide Area network technologies, the Long-Range-Radio (LoRa) has the features of long range,\n\
    low  power,  and  robustness,  and  thus  plays  an  important  role  in  building\
    \  IoT  applications  where  IoT\nobjects are connected to the internet at affordable costs. Since the development of LoRa, many IoT appli-\n\
    cations have adopted LoRa and achieved success in the market. Currently, IoT technologies keep evolv-\n\
    ing towards different fields, giving rise to multifarious IoT applications including industrial IoT, smart\n\
    city IoT, healthcare IoT, and direct-to-satellite IoT. In the meantime, LoRa also keeps developing and\n\
    finding its position in various IoT applications either as a main or complementary player. The objective\n\
    of this survey is to (1) provide a fundamental understanding of the LoRa technology; (2) explore research\n\
    activities studying LoRa based communication systems for new IoT applications; and (3) demonstrate\n\
    how the LoRa technology works together with other technologies to deliver better IoT services to end\n\
    users.\nKeywords: internet of things; long range radio; low power wide area network\n\
     \n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a set of technologies cooperating to network the physical world [1], and\n\
    aims to interconnect everything and enable proper processing on the collected data in order to support high-level\n\
    decision making. Early in 1999, Kevin Aston [2] used the term “Internet of Things” to describe a system using radio\n\
    frequency identification (RFID) to keep tracking and monitoring on goods in supply chain management. In his idea,\n\
    an object is possible to be automatically recognized, recorded and analyzed if it can be identified by machines. As\n\
    defined  by  ITU  (International  Telecommunication  Union)  [3],  an  IoT  system\
    \  consists  of  three  components:  the\ndevice,  IoT  and  thing.  The  device\
    \  is  “ a  piece  of  equipment  with  mandatory  capabilities  of  communication\
    \  and\noptional capabilities of sensing, actuation, data capture, data storage and data processing”. The IoT refers to “a global\n\
    infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things\n\
    based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies”. The thing refers to “an\n\
    object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things), which is capable of being\n\
    identified and integrated into communication networks”. A simplified IoT application is shown in Figure 1.\n\
    International Journal of Network Dynamics and Intelligence\n \nhttps://www.sciltp.com/journals/ijndi\n\
    A volcano (i.e. the Thing) cannot talk to human being until its characteristics is “translated” into a digital for-\n\
    mat by “Device”, e.g. a temperature sensor. Since it is not convenient to have personnel watch the sensor all day\n\
    long, it is necessary to have a way to transfer data to a remote site. Deploying a temperature sensor (i.e. devices with\n\
    optional capabilities) with a communication module (i.e. device with mandatory capabilities) which has connections\n\
    to the Internet is considered as a proper solution, namely IoT. The challenges of building an IoT system come from\n\
    the establishment of links between the network and the far-away physical devices, e.g. a refrigerator, an air condi-\n\
    tioner and a temperature/humidity sensor. Such devices usually work individually, generate a small volume of data,\n\
    and sometimes ask for low power consumption. For example, an electricity meter is installed in a metal cabinet in the\n\
    cellar of a house, and is able to report energy readings every 15 minutes. Each reporting consists of a four-byte meter\n\
    reading and a 13 bytes overhead [4]. Typically, a community has hundreds of meters in operation. Since meters are\n\
    installed in the cellar of house, deploying cables for meters to be connected to network may have difficulty and there-\n\
    fore, applying wireless communication seems to be a promising solution [4−6]. However, wireless communication is\n\
    prone to failures due to various factors, including building materials, interior structures of houses/buildings and other\n\
    radio systems coexisting in the same area [7]. To obtain better link budget, the narrow band (NB) wireless technol-\n\
    ogy is a preferable choice that outperforms the wide-band wireless technology in the processing gains and radio sen-\n\
    sitivity, and is usually summarized as the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology [8].\n\
    As concluded in [9], typical LPWAN technologies include long range radio wide area network (LoRaWAN),\n\
    NB-IoT, SigFox, and Wi-Sun that are designed for connecting large number of low-cost, low power consumption\n\
    and low throughput end devices with large coverage areas. Generally, LoRaWAN and SigFox can achieve a conver-\n\
    gence area larger than 10 kilometers’ communication range [10]. NB-IoT makes use of the widely deployed base\n\
    stations to achieve city level coverage. Wi-Sun is an enterprise–grade mesh network technology [11]. Each of\n\
    the aforementioned technologies has its own characteristic for certain scenarios. For instance, LoRaWAN is suitable\n\
    for applications requiring low data rate, low power consumption, and feasible deployment regarding private or public\n\
    network access. SigFox is appropriate for applications asking for ultra-low data rate and power consumption. NB-IoT\n\
    is a low power consumption technology but requires public network access. Wi-Sun is good for smart city applica-\n\
    tions but needs complex network operation management.\nThis survey aims to (1) introduce the concept of LoRa techniques and provide a fundamental understanding of\n\
    LoRa communication; (2) explore research activities studying LoRa based IoT applications; and (3) demonstrate how\n\
    LoRa techniques working together with other technologies to deliver better services to end users in emerging IoT\n\
    application areas. Particularly, the research activities carried out to resolve LoRa communication issues for specific\n\
    IoT areas are studied, such as communication protocol, performance optimization, and application deployment. There\n\
    are lots of LoRa related survey papers made by researchers that summarize and discuss LoRa technologies. In [12]\n\
    authors made comparisons between LoRa and NB-IoT at issues of physical layer design, battery consumption, net-\n\
    work coverage, deployment model and cost. In [13,14], the authors provided a comprehensive survey for LoRa tech-\n\
    nique, including performance of modulation technology, Medium Access Control protocol design, LoRa security and\n\
    list of LoRa applications. Moreover, in [15], the LoRa technique was analyzed from down to top to show current\n\
    research effort on improving performance metrics related to LoRa. Compared with previous surveys, our contribu-\n\
    tion  is  to  summarize  the  use  of  LoRa  along  with  requirements  in  different\
    \  IoT  application  fields.  Continuously\nemerging IoT applications/fields are the major motivation in driving the evolvement of LoRa techniques, giving rise\n\
    to not only new enhancement and optimization at certain technical points, but also new paradigm of LoRa applica-\n\
    tion along with other technologies. As such, it is of great importance to review the LoRa research by taking it as an\n\
    important constituent part of the IoT applications.\nThe rest of this survey is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses characteristics of different IoT fields and\n\
    their requirements to LoRa technique. Section 3 introduces basic concept of LoRa radio communication and research\n\
    studies on LoRa modulation schemes and performance optimization. In Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7, the adoption of LoRa\n\

    reviewed and discussed. Conclusion about the development trend of LoRa in the concept of IoT is made in Section 8.\n\
    2. Iot and LoRa\nExactly speaking, the IoT is not an individual technology but a comprehensive concept covering tremendous\n\
    technologies and evolving with the development of information and communication technologies. The IoT is in fact\n\
    an evolution of mobile, embedded applications and everything that is connected to the internet [16], which generates\n\
    urgent needs for a new paradigm of data collection and processing. Furthermore, the IoT is an expansion of conven-\n\
    tional network technologies in a sense whose core concept is to build interconnections among “Things” and further\n\
    have the physical world networked.\nNowadays, more and more IoT related applications emerge as either new market spaces develop or existing\n\
    technologies upgrade, which pushes an evolution of IoT technologies in different fields. One feature of IoT applica-\n\
    tions is the diversity of communication requirements which is also the main difference between conventional com-\n\
    munications and IoT communications. In conventional applications, the Internet connected devices, such as comput-\n\
    ers, tablets, and mobile phones, are mainly controlled by humans with stable network connections, whereas in IoT\n\
    applications, the scope of devices connecting to the Internet are extended to every kind of devices, including sensors,\n\
    actuators and tags [17]. Development of the IoT contains not only conventional systems, but also comprehensive\n\
    interactions introduced by “Smart Objects” (e.g. sophisticated smart gadgets, smartphones, and smart vehicles) which\n\
    exhibit different degrees of intelligence in data processing and communication with conventional systems [18].\n\
    To be specific, the Video-on-Demand service is a typical application using conventional communication tech-\n\
    nologies. Video programs are pre-stored on servers, and TV terminals can request certain program from a server\n\
    nearby. The communication content is almost fixed and the traffic over communication links is predictable. Note that\n\
    the  entire  system  works  in  a  closed-loop  manner  as  insertion  of  new\
    \  programs,  increment  of  subscriptions,  and\ncapacity of networks are always under control. Using distributed sensors to help manage smart agriculture is a popu-\n\
    lar application of IoT. Various sensors connect to local edge servers to provide real-time sensory data critical to the\n\
    crops. The edge server makes decisions, e.g. irrigation or sowing, based on the received data. The source of data\n\
    comes from real-world, which means the major challenges imposed on IoT communications come from aspects of\n\
    data volume, variety, veracity and velocity [19].\nMany IoT applications require long range, low data rate, low energy consumption and cost effective wireless\n\
    communication [20]. As one of LPWAN technologies, the LoRa has the most technical advantages required by IoT\n\
    applications. Particularly,  the  open  design  (except  for  physical  layers)\
    \  feature  of  the  LoRa  provides  great   conve-\nnience for researchers and developers to study and use. In general, IoT applications requiring the involvement of\n\
    LoRa technique possess two common characteristics: wireless communication in difficult radio environment and low\n\
    data rate [21−23]. Difficult environment refers to interferences and long range communications that many IoT appli-\n\
    cations have to face when deploying networks. Low data rate means only IoT applications requiring small data can\n\
    adopt LoRa. In the following sections, the LoRa radio and representative IoT fields in which LoRa is a main or sup-\n\
    plementary player in building wireless communication links are selected and discussed to explore research activities\n\
    made for the use of LoRa. The typical IoT fields include industrial IoT, smart city IoT, healthcare IoT, agriculture\n\
    IoT, and DtS-IoT [17,24].\n3. LoRa Radio Communication\nLoRa is a narrowband communication technology patented by Semtech [25], and is a kind of physical layer\n\
    modulation  technologies  that  utilize  Chirp  (Compressed  High  Intensity  Radar\
    \  Pulse)  Spread  Spectrum  (CSS)  to\nachieve significant long communication range and robustness to interference on the premise of low power consump-\n\
    tion [26, 27], and this is also the key to make LoRa stay competitive compared with other LPWAN technologies. A\n\
    comparison between LoRa and other mainstream IoT wireless communication technologies is listed in [28−31].\n\
    The IoT wireless communication technologies listed in Table 1 can help end devices build links to networks.\n\
    However, such technologies can only be applicable to certain application fields due to their technology differences.\n\
    NB-IoT and SigFox can achieve long range communication, and are unsuitable for applications requiring use of local\n\
    area networks. This is because NB-IoT and SigFox establish direct links between end devices and operators’ net-\n\
    works (i.e. public networks). Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can provide relative high data rate and are suitable for multimedia\n\
    applications. As a trade-off, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth consume more energy compared with other technologies. ZigBee is\n\
    a low cost and low power consumption technology for short-range IoT applications, and thus has limited coverage. In\n\
    contrast,  LoRa  can  provide  dynamic  radio  coverage  for  large-scale  IoT\
    \  applications  which  require  long  lifetime,\nwhereas the main shortage of LoRa comes from its low data rate.\n\

     \nApplication  scenarios  in  which  LoRa  outperforms  than  other  technologies\
    \  include  logistics  tracking,  assert\ntracking, smart agriculture, healthcare, etc. [32]. An important characteristic of these scenarios is uncertain communi-\n\
    cation range, which can be a few meters or up to a few kilometers. Excellent design of receiving sensitivity makes\n\
    LoRa capable of covering large area with limited power supply. On the contrary, it is clear that LoRa is not suitable\n\
    for high data rate applications whose major candidates are Wi-Fi or Bluetooth based technologies. Performance of\n\
    LoRa modem is configurable through a few parameters, which typically include: spreading factor (SF), bandwidth\n\
    (BW), and coding rate (CR) [33].\n● Spreading Factor (SF)\nSF represents the level that the spread spectrum algorithm works on each bit. The higher the SF is, the more\n\
    spreading code will be used for each bit. Consequently, the receiving sensitivity at the receiver side improves c. LoRa\n\
    supports SF ranges from 6 to 12.\n● Bandwidth (BW)\nBandwidth is directly related to the data rate. If a higher bandwidth is used, a higher data rate can be achieved at\n\
    the cost of reduced receiving sensitivity. In the contrary, a smaller bandwidth is helpful in obtaining better receiver\n\
    sensitivity, but data rate decreases accordingly. The BW option supported by LoRa ranges from 7.8 kHz to 500 kHz\n\
    (at Sub-1 GHz frequency band).\n● Error Correction Rate (ECR)\nCyclic error coding is employed as the forward error detection and correction scheme in the LoRa technology.\n\
    The higher the CR value is, the stronger capability of error correction can be achieved. However, additional overhead\n\
    is included in transmission which reduces effective user data rate. LoRa modem supports CR from 4/5 to 4/8. The\n\
    overhead ratio for different CR is shown in Table 2\n \n \nTable 2    Cyclic coding overhead\n\

    \  −111  dBm  to  −148  dBm,  and  is  achieved  by  selecting  different  combinations\

    IJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n \n7\nAs stated in [34], LoRa can provide over 150 dB link budget for long range communication. When installed at\n\
    fixed position and configured with certain settings (14 dBm tx power, BW = 125 kHz, SF = 12), a LoRa gateway can\n\
    achieve 62% packet delivery rate at range of 15-30 km, 88% and 85% at range of 2 and 5 km. Regarding mobile sit-\n\
    uation, a reliable communication link can be established if relative speed is lower than 25 km/h. Significant packet\n\
    loss is observed when relative speed is close to or over 40 km/h. The test results show that LoRa modem is capable\n\
    of providing service in either stationary or mobile scenarios.\nIoT applications, such as environment monitoring, smart metering, plant monitoring, etc., require massive and\n\
    large deployment, but very few data payload which could be as small as one byte to indicate On or Off states. The\n\
    corresponding data report interval could be as slow as 1 packet/day or 1 packet/hour. The key point here is long range\n\
    communication and low power consumption. LoRa achieves this objective with the use of CSS. Since LoRa is a pro-\n\
    prietary technique, researchers mainly focus on performance study. Relevant proposals of physical layer optimiza-\n\
    tions are based on general principles of CSS. The important features of LoRa communication which receive wide\n\
    interests from industry sections are long range communication capability, robustness to interferences, and low power\n\
    consumption. Mroue et al. made an analytical study along with simulation work to explain and improve LoRa-based\n\
    BER (Bit Error Rate) expressions [35]. The proposed BER expression is more accurate compared with the conven-\n\
    tional error probability of CSS by introducing a few parameters such as symbol frequency, sampling frequency, sig-\n\
    nal-to-noise and implementation loss. In [36], mathematic expressions describing generation and demodulation of\n\
    LoRa signal were made. In addition, authors in [36] proposed a simplified filter design to reduce number of coeffi-\n\
    cients of digital filters in the baseband process at the receiver. Simulation results showed that the design can achieve\n\
    satisfactory performance of symbol error rate at a cost of slightly increment of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) loss.\n\
    As the LoRa technology may be used to collect sensory data in a dense network, its feature of the “orthogonal\n\
    spreading factor” is usually taken to provide simultaneous transmission capability, i.e. multiple communications are\n\
    allowed to happen simultaneously as long as they employ different spreading factors. However, such transmission\n\
    might be inaccurate since the achievement of “orthogonality” needs certain condition, i.e. the threshold of SIR (Signal-\n\
    to-Interference  Ratio).  In  [37],  authors  implemented  simulation  and  practical\
    \  experiments  to  determine  if  desired\nLoRa  communication  can  be  successfully\
    \  completed  at  the  presence  of  “ interfering  LoRa  signal”   with  different\n\
    spreading factors. The result showed that by average, a 16 dB co-channel rejection value should be satisfied to have\n\
    desired communication successfully completed. It is for the reason that the receiver takes the interfering LoRa signal\n\
    as a chirped waveform (a wide-band spectrum) and tries to look for a peak value to synchronize with the desired sig-\n\
    nal whose strength should be 16 dB higher than the interfering signal. This finding indicates that applying different\n\
    spreading factors may not be sufficient to build independent communication channels if interfering LoRa devices are\n\
    close to the receiver during communication.\nIn fact, LoRa is one de-factor standard of IoT technologies for long range communication where there might be\n\
    hundreds of meters or kilometers between a LoRa end device and a LoRa gateway. As a kind of NB wireless tech-\n\
    nologies, LoRa can achieve longer communication range than that of wideband wireless communication technolo-\n\
    gies, e.g. WiFi, and Bluetooth, with given transmission power (usually it is a mandatory requirement made by local\n\
    authority for radio usage at industrial scientific medical (ISM) band in different regions). However, there is a trade-off\n\
    between communication range and data rate. NB systems can support low data rate since a small bandwidth has limi-\n\
    tations in channel capacity according to Shannon-Hartley theorem [38]. Obviously, low data rate means a long radio\n\
    propagation time which results in high possibility of wireless conflicts between different radio communications. For\n\
    example, LoRa devices support receiving sensitivity low to −136 dBm when the spreading factor is 12, bandwidth is\n\
    125 kHz and nominal data rate is 293 bps. A short message whose length is tens of bytes may last for a few seconds\n\
    over the air, and this significantly increases the possibility of radio conflicts and interferences.\n\
    A dilemma of IoT applications is the use of NB radio systems to implement large scale and dense deployment,\n\

     \n8\ne.g. utility meter reading, smart agriculture, and environment monitoring. Many research carried out at the physical\n\
    layer of LoRa-like modulation schemes focus on data rate improvement on the premise of keeping receiving sensi-\n\
    tivity at an acceptable level. Authors in [39] proposed a novel design of chirp transmitters and orthogonal hirp gener-\n\
    ators (OCGs) to support a wide range of spreading factors and bandwidth at a low cost. In addition, a phase-shifted\n\
    CSS (PS-CSS) was proposed to increase transmission rate by which a maximum of 33% improvement (spreading\n\
    factor is 6) was made compared to conventional CSS technologies.\nIn order to improve spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, alternative chirp spread spectrum techniques, in-\n\
    phase and quadrature CSS (IQCSS) and discrete chirp rate keying CSS (DCRK-CSS), were proposed in [40]. As\n\
    claimed by the authors, IQCSS can double throughputs compared with LoRa. DCRK-CSS can increase the through-\n\
    put up to 50% under certain conditions. The throughput optimization brought by the two schemes is obtained using\n\
    the same transmission power when compared with LoRa modulation, and this means less energy will be consumed as\n\
    shorter time is required to complete transmission. An idea of using index modulation (IM) in CSS was proposed in\n\
    [41]. Different from other techniques, using IM in CSS means multiple chirps are simultaneously transmitted which\n\
    allows more bits to be embedded in symbols. Consequently, the complexity of receiver design increases as it requires\n\
    more resources to detect and estimate data bits from a larger signal set. In order to reduce computational complexity,\n\
    a suboptimal detection algorithm was also proposed to analyze and locate desired data set in a recursive manner.\n\
    Although LoRa is a kind of proprietary technique, it mainly refers to the modulation scheme. Developers can\n\
    implement design or optimization for other layers of OSI models except for physical layers. Essentially, LoRa radio\n\
    provides wireless link for connecting devices. The medium ccess control (MAC) protocol, which is part of Link\n\
    Layer, is an important component as it is direactly related to the starting point of communication, which must take\n\
    various factors into consideration, e.g. the channel state, radio environment, acknowledgement, frequency usage and\n\
    traffic condition.\nAs  the  most  well-known  LoRa  communication  based  system,\
    \  LoRaWAN  has  been  adopted  worldwide.\nLoRaWAN defines the use of the ALOHA type medium access control method, which inevitably introduces packet\n\
    collision or packet loss. Early in 2016, Augustin et al [42] made simulations to study LoRaWAN MAC layer perfor-\n\
    mance. With given settings (100 LoRaWAN end devices, channel bandwidth = 125 kHz, coding rate = 4/5, pream-\n\
    ble = 6, payload range [1,58] bytes, packet arrival follows Poisson law), the obtained capacity usage is 18% of the\n\
    channel capacity, which is chosen to be the pure-ALOHA protocol. Corresponding link load is 0.48 at which around\n\
    60% of the packet transmission failed due to collisions. Due to the absence of channel detection algorithms, e.g.\n\
    CSMA in 802.11 standard, success rate of LoRaWAN MAC layer is very sensitive to the channel load as pure-\n\
    ALOHA.\nAuthors in [43] built a mathematical model to describe packet collision and packet loss in a LoRaWAN net-\n\
    work consisting of a number of LoRaWAN end devices and a LoRaWAN gateway. Probability of packet collision\n\
    increases in a LoRaWAN network as the increment of packet payload size or the value of spreading factor. Packet\n\
    loss has close relationship with duration of LoRaWAN uplink packet and LoRaWAN gateway delay (the packet loss\n\
    happens  when  the  gateway  is  sending  ACK  for  preceding  uplink  LoRaWAN\
    \  communication).  In  [44],  a  packet\nlatency model was built by taking packet collision probability and regulatory duty-cycle requirements into considera-\n\
    tion. LoRaWAN works on license free ISM band where radio activity is normally limited by local regulators dedi-\n\
    cated to the usage of transmitters. The MAC layer performance evaluation for LoRaWAN should include this limita-\n\
    tion as an important factor.\nRecently, LoRa has proposed a new modulation technique, i.e. the long-range frequency hopping spread spec-\n\
    trum (LR-FHSS), to further enhance long range capability and improve network capacity. The motivation for devel-\n\
    oping LR-FHSS is to remove limitations made by duty-cycle regional regulations [45]. Regional regulations strictly\n\
    define the period a radio can be active on a given channel. The number of terminals and data size for each transmis-\n\
    sion are also limited, which consequently reduces LoRaWAN network capacity. By the method of frequency hop-\n\
    ping, transmission is divided into a number of pieces and each piece is transmitted on different channels. As summa-\n\
    rized in [46], LR-FHSS works around limitations by intra-packet hopping to carry longer payload with slow data rate\n\
    in regions with restrictions on dwell time. Theoretical analysis shows that a 10 dB link budget improvement (about 3 ×\n\
    free-space transmission distance improvement) can be achieved under certain conditions (in the FCC region on the\n\
    915 MHz band) [46]. A 140× capacity improvement is possible to be achieved when comparing LR-FHSS with con-\n\
    ventional LoRa (SF12) communication [46]. LR-FHSS is compatible with LoRaWAN hardware and networks where\n\
    only software upgrading is needed. Such changes allow more and more applications previously restricted by LoRa\n\
    network capacity to achieve significant improvement and consolidate the application market of LoRa in long range\n\
    low data rate communication.\n4. Industry Iot and LoRa\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n\
     \n9\nConventionally industry related systems are isolated from public networks. Since the proposal of the fourth\n\
    industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), communication, autonomous and decentralized decisions with the aim of increas-\n\
    ing  industrial  efficiency,  productivity,  safety  and  transparency  have  become\
    \  a  new  system  design  purpose  [47].\nIndustrial IoT is a comprehensive topic referring to various disciplines. When it comes to wireless communication, a\n\
    strict requirement is proposed to the employed radio system: deterministic timing. Data communication in industry\n\
    systems usually has real-time timeliness requirements since failure of fulfilling the timing requirement may compro-\n\
    mise system performance or even cause dangers to human lives [48].\nNormal wireless systems utilize the ALOHA-like protocol, or the CSMA-CA algorithm to deal with channel\n\
    access and to implement interference avoidance. Channel access strategies based on randomness are not applicable in\n\
    Industry IoT because radio environment in industrial scenarios often suffer from various channel impairments such as\n\
    path loss, shadowing effect and unpredictable obstacles [49,50]. An idea of achieving deterministic behavior in wire-\n\
    less communication is to bound timing of transmission and receiving within a specified period, i.e. a slot. In [51],\n\
    authors proposed a modified time slotted channel hoping (TSCH) strategy for the use of the LoRaWAN MAC layer\n\
    to enable better frequency and code diversity on LoRaWAN end devices and network servers. In the evaluation test,\n\
    LoRaWAN end devices were allocated with different spreading factors and different channels. Data transmission was\n\
    not based on random access but started with synchronized signal by which packet conflicts on a channel can be elim-\n\
    inated. This method supports unconfirmed uplink communication only.\nTo achieve flexible communication in Industrial IoT, authors in [52] proposed a new MAC layer strategy to\n\
    support real-time data flow over LoRa based networks (RT-LoRa). RT-LoRa works with star topology in which a\n\
    sink node takes responsibility of synchronizing all end devices using regular beacon signals. End devices consist of\n\
    two types: the stationary node and mobile node. The stationary node is responsible for collecting sensory data whilst\n\
    the mobile node is allowed to move in the sensing area. In-network time is organized and bounded by cyclically\n\
    repeated superframe which mainly consists of beacon, contention access period (CAP) and contention free period\n\
    (CFP) .\nFeatures of RT-LoRa can be concluded as follows. (1) CAP and CFP contain a number of timeslot sets by\n\
    which duration of radio activities can be measured and strictly restricted within one or more slots, (2) In CAP, end\n\
    devices  use  Slotted-ALOHA  based  strategies  along  with  randomly  generated\
    \  3-tuple  parameters  (the  channel,\nspreading factor and time slot) to compete for channel accessing. The random parameters distribute channel usage by\n\
    which the success rate of communication increases. (3) In CFP, only end devices allocated in the current time slot is\n\
    allowed to communicate with the sink node, (4) QoS algorithm is provided in CFP to ensure reliability of communi-\n\
    cation at levels of normal, reliable and most reliable, (5) Radio channels are carefully allocated in each superframe to\n\
    fulfill requirements of duty-cycle under different regions.\nA similar real-time LoRa protocol was also proposed in [53] to achieve collision-free communication. Timing\n\
    in a LoRa network is divided into frames and further divided into a number of slots. On this basis, a real-time task\n\
    scheduling algorithm using logical slot indices is provided to regulate LoRa end device radio communication accord-\n\
    ing to the length of data packet, i.e. transmission time required for communication. With the help of modified Listen-\n\
    Before-Talk mechanism, the evaluation test confirmed that over 94% packet delivering rate is achievable although\n\
    high external interferences are present.\nIn the scenarios of Industrial IoT, LoRa techniques are usually employed to collect data generated on LoRa end\n\

    nication in industry relies on cable connection (e.g. Ethernet, Field-bus, RS232/485), which has less concern about the\n\
    interference and latency. Wireless communication usually faces problems of performance degradation as it is easy to\n\
    be affected by interferences and packet conflicts. The LoRa technique has better performance on interference resis-\n\
    tance, but is heavily affected by packet conflicts due to low data rate. Therefore, a proper strategy to optimize wire-\n\
    less latency is quite important and of great needs, if LoRa is to be used in Industrial IoT. In this case, power con-\n\
    sumption issue is normally not of the highest priority.\n5. Smart City Iot and\
    \ LoRa\nDue to its requirement for massive and large-scale sensor deployment, it is common for smart city IoT to adopt\n\
    the LoRa technique. Although LoRa has long range communication capability, it has relatively low data rate which\n\
    affects overall system performance about network capacity, deployment density and power consumption. In [54],\n\
    authors studied the radio coverage issue of LoRa networks and concluded that (1) it is possible to achieve an 100%\n\
    packet delivery ratio up to 4 km range and 99% for over 4.8 km under certain conditions. In this case, a LoRaWAN\n\
    gateway is installed at the height of 30 m above ground, and (2) an empirical path loss model is proposed to deter-\n\
    mine LoRa link budget at frequency bands of 868 MHz and 433 MHz.\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n\
     \n10\nAlthough LoRa techniques provide desired radio performance for applications of large scale sensor deployment,\n\
    it is not easy to arrange such deployment as various technical parameters are involved in a LoRa based communica-\n\
    tion network, e.g. the spreading factor, frequency band, coding rate, distance and obstacle between LoRa end devices\n\
    and LoRa gateways. In [55], an optimal configuration scheme is provided to allocate appropriate spreading factors\n\
    and transmission power for every LoRa end device in a LoRaWAN network. The objective of the optimal configu-\n\
    ration scheme is to reduce probability of collisions and energy consumption. Two stages are adopted in the scheme.\n\
    At stage 1, each node tries to be allocated with a proper spreading factor by issuing communication to a gateway\n\
    using maximum transmission power, and this ensures that the spreading factor later allocated for an end device by the\n\
    gateway is sufficient to establish a LoRa radio link. At stage 2, the level of transmission power is further optimized\n\
    for an end device in order to save energy consumption on the premise of the reliable radio link. In [56], a compre-\n\
    hensive study on spreading factor allocation for LoRa based sensor nodes in dense network was studied, where an\n\
    overall consideration was taken for the use of spreading factors along with directly related parameters, e.g. the pay-\n\
    load size, packet error rate, ALOHA mechanism and duty-cycle requirement. Based on the distance between differ-\n\
    ent LoRa end devices and LoRa gateway, a suggestion about spreading factor allocation was given to improve deliv-\n\
    ery rate of overall network.\nIn [57], a LoRa-based mesh network was discussed to extend and enhance LoRa network coverage. LoRa radio\n\
    has long range capability, but is affected by deployment environment. Indoor obstacle can easily stop radio propaga-\n\
    tion, which is also a common issue for most wireless systems. Mesh networks enable each in-network LoRa device to\n\
    be a relay node to provide packet forward functionality for neighbor nodes which cannot directly reach a LoRa gate-\n\
    way. A similar idea can be found in [58] where a simplified AODV routing protocol was proposed to organize a\n\
    LoRa mesh network to cover areas that out the range of a single LoRaWAN gateway. A hierarchy-based energy effi-\n\
    cient routing protocol (HBEE) designed for the LoRa mesh network was proposed in [59]. In order to quickly build a\n\
    network structure, HBEE employs concurrent transmission to spread gateway information through the entire network.\n\
    Concurrent transmission means multiple LoRa network devices at the same level of a tree network forward data\n\
    packet using a synchronized way, which greatly reduces possibility of packet collision and minimizes network for-\n\
    mation time. Multi-path and multi-channel communication algorithms were used during the data collection stage that\n\
    further improves final data delivery rate. The experimental results obtained in [59] showed HBEE can achieve packet\n\
    reception rate of 95.7% and 89.8% during the network formation stage and normal operation stage, respectively.\n\
    Smart city IoT makes full use of LoRa capability of configurate radio range such that LoRa end devices located\n\
    at different positions can reach the sink node (e.g. the LoRa gateway) without modifying modulation schemes, which\n\
    is  normally  not  applicable  in  many  other  technologies.  Although  the  LoRaWAN\
    \  standard  is  a  successful  market\nexample in dealing with large scale sensor deployment, it faces the challenge of wireless packet collision, giving rise\n\
    to the requirement of reasonable configuration and optimization schemes. Moreover, severe radio environment may\n\
    affect wireless reception despite the fact that LoRa can achieve long range communication. Ad-hoc based mesh net-\n\
    works can provide flexible deployment options, and are particularly useful in smart city scenarios, see references [60−62].\n\
    6. Direct-to-satellite Iot and LoRa\nDtS-IoT is a very attractive IoT filed which extremely expands physical world connection from the Earth to the\n\
    space, and internet access is quite convenient in populated areas. However, DtS-IoT is not achievable at most areas\n\
    on the Earth. Satellite communication is the only solution to provide global coverage. DtS-IoT is a promising research\n\
    topic that helps address connectivity issues in certain scenarios, for example, disaster recovery scenarios of earth-\n\
    quakes, tsunamis and flooding [63]. Connectivity between ground networks (devices) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO)\n\
    satellites can be achieved in two ways, indirect and direct (as shown in Figure 2 below). For those short range com-\n\
    munication systems, a ground based gateway is required to play as a relay to build mutual communication with satel-\n\
    lites. For long range wireless systems such as LoRa, it is possible to build direct links which make ground deploy-\n\
    ment more convenient and cost effective.\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n\

     \nWhen LEO satellites moving around the Earth, if a satellite is out of range of LoRaWAN end device, the end\n\
    device will adjust the beacon detection window until next beacon from next satellite is captured. In [65], impact of\n\
    ionospheric scintillation was comprehensively studied to evaluate the limitations of LoRa communication in the use\n\
    of space-to-Earth satellite communications, while in [66] a trajectory-based LoRa radio uplink transmission policy\n\
    was studied to improve the success rate of direct connection from the LoRa end device to the satellite in space. The\n\
    policy takes various factors into consideration, e.g. the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of LoRa beacons\n\
    from satellites, frequency shift of beacons (to determine the speed of satellite), and orbital parameters. The result\n\
    obtained from the analysis of these factors can be used for different transmission policies: plain trajectory, trajectory\n\
    random, trajectory skip and trajectory random. As authors stated, the proposed policy can at least duplicate the net-\n\
    work scalability compared with conventional LoRa communication methods.\nLoRa techniques used in space-ground communication are still in a pre-research stage but with very attractive\n\
    vision  [67].  Successful  links  established  between  LoRa  devices  and  satellites\
    \  can  make  IoT  globe  coverage  cost\neffective by removing ground station usage. However, there is a long way before this solution becomes mature as\n\
    extreme long range communication introduces research challenges in areas of modulation technique, antenna design,\n\
    signal processing, data coding, power management, uplink and downlink policies, interaction between satellites, etc.\n\

    connectivity issues between doctors and patients in urban areas and portions of rural areas [72]. Authors in [72] pro-\n\

    LoRa gateway for processing by fog computing based machine learning models. As conventional Internet connec-\n\

    system to the Internet by which doctors from anywhere of the world are able to keep monitoring on status of patients.\n\
    In [73] a hybrid and edge based healthcare system was proposed where wearable sensor were equipped on the\n\
    human body to take responsibility of monitoring health state and reporting to central system. The reporting can expe-\n\
    rience either of two communication paths, i.e. LoRa or Bluetooth, depending on the distance between sensors and\n\
    gateways. If a Bluetooth router is within effective range, health data will be sent to router and then forwarded to an\n\
    edge gateway. Otherwise, the LoRa radio link will be used to convey data to the edge gateway since LoRa can sup-\n\
    port larger coverage than Bluetooth. The edge gateway is in charge of implementing data processing and making\n\
    quick responses to situations. Functionalities such as data storage and data analysis are implemented later by a remote\n\
    cloud server. By combining short-range and long-range wireless communication technologies, data collection in a\n\

    \ Future Development of LoRa\nIoT is becoming more and more complicated compared with its initial version. Having devices complete tasks\n\
    of reporting sensory data and controlling actuators is an important part of IoT. However, the way of system organiza-\n\
    tion and the pattern of network operation are more and more diverse, due to expansion of application fields which\n\
    require advanced IoT technologies to improve existing systems, or build new systems for certain targets (e.g. com-\n\
    munication between low power ground-based devices and satellites). This motivates IoT to move deeply into appli-\n\
    cation scenarios to construct reasonable and efficient systems. In the meantime, technologies adopted in different IoT\n\
    application scenarios keep developing in different aspects, including new algorithms, system optimization, and sys-\n\
    tem integration. As a kind of low power wireless technologies, LoRa is usually taken by IoT applications to achieve\n\
    long range communication, which means that effectively integrating LoRa into different systems is one promising\n\
    future research direction in the development of LoRa. Possible topics on these issues may include but not limited to:\n\
    5G network and LoRa, edge computing and LoRa.\n8.1. 5G and LoRa\n5G network is becoming more and more popular due to its exciting features of massive machine-type commu-\n\
    nication (mMTC) supporting 1 million devices/km2, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) supporting less than 4 ms\n\
    latency, and ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (URLLC) supporting mission critical applications with less\n\
    than 0.5 ms latency [74]. In Industry 4.0 and its later version, mMTC and URLLC are often mentioned as 5G offers\n\
    significant performance improvement compared with conventional wireless access techniques (e.g. 3G/4G). Tradi-\n\
    tional industry applications adopt cabling systems to achieve reliable and low latency communication, which has\n\
    urgent requirements for wireless solutions. Applications such as real-time monitoring, industry-robotics, and remote\n\
    communication support require highly reliable and low latency wireless technologies to provide most convenience\n\
    when deploying system [75]. Combining the LoRa and 5G based gateway will be a focus of research. A random-\n\
    based MAC protocol is not suitable for LoRa to be used in these cases. A systematic re-design is needed for LoRa to\n\
    cooperate with 5G to achieve precise control by eliminating any uncertainty caused by interference or collisions. For\n\
    example, the concept of time sensitivity networking (TSN) over 5G has been proposed to enable reliable and deter-\n\
    ministic wireless communications between end devices and 5G networks [76−78]. The development of LoRa can be\n\
    taken as a reference to design TSN-like algorithms in order to make proper arrangement for (1) scheduling priority-\n\
    based uplink traffic, (2) ensuring downlink control signaling, and (3) managing network scalability.\n\
    8.2. Edge Computing and LoRa\nEdge computing is a familiar topic to researchers for the reason of rapid growth of IoT applications requiring\n\
    quick responses to the generated data, such as Vehicular Data Analytics, Smart Home, Video Stream Analytics and\n\
    Virtual Reality [79]. Conventionally cloud based computing is used to process information collected from different\n\
    locations, but has limitations in providing real-time responses for safety-critical and performance-sensitivity applica-\n\
    tions  due  to  unpredictable  latency  [80].  Edge  computing  proposes  a  new\
    \  computing  paradigm  by  migrating  data\ncomputation or storage to the network “edge” in order to mitigate the escalation in resource congestion at the central\n\
    computing unit [81]. In such a paradigm, an edge node is expected to not only exchange data between the local net-\n\
    work and the remote center, but also have capability on processing data received via multiple interfaces at the local\n\
    side. Many studies about LoRa related edge computing can be found from [82−87] that cover fields of medical care,\n\
    agriculture, block-chain, smart metering, smart city, artificial intelligence, etc. Note that LoRa can also be used in any\n\
    possible scenarios by cooperating with different hardware/algorithms. For example, in [86] authors proposed a sys-\n\
    tem integrated with edge/fog computing, where LoRa and deep learning algorithms were used to perform fall detec-\n\
    tion. And overcome the lack of network infrastructures at certain areas. In [87] LoRa and Bluetooth worked together\n\
    to build a low power smart city network (as shown in Figure 6) designed for collecting daily information such as\n\
    transportation state, health data, etc. The data is generated and sent to the LoRa edge gateway via short range Blue-\n\
    tooth, and then forwarded to the LoRa fog gateway via long range LoRa links. On the LoRa edge and fog gateway,\n\
    preliminary data processing will be implemented by which corresponding responses can be made at the local side and\n\
    the volume of data delivered to the Cloud can be minimized. A combination of LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi/Ethernet was\n\
    proposed in [88] to build an autonomous server which can process and store data even in the absence of internet con-\n\
    nectivity.\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n \n\
    14\nIt can be concluded that LoRa is quite popular as a data communication technique in many different edge com-\n\
    puting-based applications. However, as a pure physical layer communication technique, LoRa is in short of architec-\n\
    ture design to support diverse application requirements. An example solution is the LoRaWAN standard, but such a\n\
    strandard is insufficient as the deign purpose of LoRaWAN is for reporting data, rather than supporting local data\n\
    processing. In the future development, relevant research is needed to find out how to properly deploy and allocate\n\
    LoRa resource in the context of edge computing.\nIn general, it is reasonable to believe, there are two future promising development directions in LoRa, i.e. (1)\n\
    enhancement of LoRa communication efficiency, and (2) design of interaction mechanisms between LoRa and other\n\
    technologies/systems, where the enhancement on communication efficiency could be treated as a vertical develop-\n\
    ment direction. As a bottom communication technology, LoRa is often used to collect massively distributed device\n\
    data. Having data transmission deterministic and reliable is an important research topic in promoting LoRa for the use\n\
    of dense networks. Making LoRa collaborative could be treated as a horizontal development direction, where the\n\
    LoRa technique is expected to work together with different systems through proper integration.\n\
    9. Conclusions\nRapid development of IoT makes more and more application fields adopt LoRa to establish close links between\n\
    IoT objects and data processing systems. As one of LPWAN technologies, LoRa is particularly useful for network-\n\
    ing embedded and low-cost devices deployed in a wide area. As per characteristics of different IoT fields, the use of\n\
    LoRa technique may have different emphasis. In industry IoT like fields, interference robustness of LoRa along with\n\
    the specifically designed strategy for ensuring deterministic timing is the main point, which provides a reliable wire-\n\
    less communication link for industrial applications. For smart city IoT like fields, flexible radio configuration which\n\
    allows massive and large scale network deployment is the benefit brought by the LoRa technique. However, network\n\
    performance evaluation and optimization algorithms are needed to help LoRa based network to resolve packet con-\n\
    flict issues. DtS-IoT is a new area that makes use of long range communication capability to its maximum perfor-\n\
    mance. Challenges in this case require more study as existing research made for the LoRa technique may be insuffi-\n\
    cient. Healthcare IoT like fields demonstrate the use of the LoRa technique in associating with other systems or tech-\n\
    niques to improve service quality. In general, the LoRa technique is particularly important in building communica-\n\
    tion links for ubiquitous computing of IoT. Researches on further improving communication range and interference\n\
    resistance could become major focuses as they are the core factors of the LoRa technique. In the future development,\n\
    the LoRa technique can evolve towards directions of (1) efficient communication for stronger precise control capa-\n\
    bility, and (2) reasonable mechanism for better interaction with other systems.\n\

  analysis: 'The review''s relevance to the specific point and outline is analyzed
    as follows:


    Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather) and their
    collection and use


    In terms of data type, the review comprehensively covers the most common types
    collected in the field: soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather, and management.
    Other types, such as microclimate data, leaf wetness, evapotranspiration, and
    radiation, are not mentioned, which indicates that they are not widely collected
    or used. The review describes the collection methods for each type, such as WSN,
    IoT, and satellite, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages.
    However, there is no discussion of data quality, which can vary depending on the
    collection method and environmental conditions. This is an important factor to
    consider when using data for analysis and decision-making. Overall, the review
    provides a good overview of the different data types and their collection methods
    but could be improved by including more information on data quality.


    The review also discusses the use of data for various purposes, such as crop management,
    environmental monitoring, and water management. However, it does not provide specific
    examples of how the data is used in these applications. For example, it does not
    describe how soil moisture data is used to make irrigation decisions or how weather
    data is used to predict crop yields. This information would be helpful for readers
    who are interested in learning more about the practical applications of data in
    agriculture.


    Overall, the review provides a good overview of the different data types and their
    collection methods as well as how it is used in agriculture. However, it could
    be improved by including more information on data quality and specific examples
    of how the data is used in real-world applications.'

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\

    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\

    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    used in Agriculture 4.0. • Distributed Architectures and Cloud Computing complements.
    • Strategies of association between Edge, Fog, Cloud. • New architectural and
    computing trends. Abstract The Agriculture 4.0, also called Smart Agriculture
    or Smart Farming, is at the origin of the production of a huge amount of data
    that must be collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing
    this massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use adapted
    IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of Central Cloud,
    Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing Strategies, and new trends
    used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In this review, we try to answer 4 research
    questions: (1) Which storage and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture
    4.0 applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic architectures
    meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal
    development possibilities that allow the transition from research to industrialization?
    (4) What are the vertical valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained
    in the cloud to embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare architectures
    with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability, high throughput,
    Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness, Maintainability), and analyze the
    advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    the Internet of Things (IoT), also formerly named pervasive Internet, is present
    in all domains of our daily life and follows exponential growth. The number of
    connected devices is estimated at the horizon of 2022 at 42.5 billion and at the
    horizon of 2025 at 75.5 billion1. The global IP traffic is estimated to 333 ZB
    per month in 20222 with the need to store and treat this data (Carnevale et al.,
    2019). The European Commission has predicted that 18 billion of 29 billion connected
    devices will be related to the IoT in 2022 (Agency, 2020). Cisco in a white paper
    has announced that connected devices to the Internet will generate 850 ZB/year
    by 2021 (Cisco, 2018). It is difficult to precisely determine the number of connected
    devices on a world scale, but their number is about several billion. In addition,
    McKinsey Global Institute predicts a total economic impact of IoT and Edge Computing
    devices that will reach 11 trillion USD by 2025 (Manyika and Chui, 2015). In the
    sector of the agriculture, nearly 12 million agricultural sensors installed globally
    by 2023 with an increase of 20% annually, which is predicted by the Business Insider
    Intelligence Service (Meola, 2021). Moreover, the smart agriculture business was
    estimated at USD 13.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 22 billion
    by 2025 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.8% (Meola, 2021). Within
    the IoT era, the type of clients is becoming increasingly lightweight. IoT devices
    and the network environment is gradually changing from high-speed wired networks
    to unstable wireless communication. Meanwhile, users'' demand IoT applications
    is also shifting to real-time and context-aware service provisioning, making the
    focus moving progressively from the cloud to the edge (Ren et al., 2017). The
    cloud is located within the Internet and is geographically centralized, is constituted
    of a few resourceful server nodes, and is inserted in multi hops in terms of distance
    among the clients (Munir et al., 2017). Cloud Computing (CC) is a paradigm widely
    available that offers benefits like minimal management effort, convenience, rapid
    elasticity, pay per use, ubiquity (Ai et al., 2018), easy maintenance, centralized
    management, and high server utilization (Shi et al., 2016). Furthermore, resources
    centralization implies an increase of average network latency, heavy bandwidth
    utilization, and high processing delay. Indeed, the tremendous amount of data
    handled in a unique server point can create congestion in the cloud servers and
    backhaul links (El-Sayed et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the rapid parallel development
    of the pervasive intelligent device, ubiquitous network, growth in popularity
    of virtual and augmented reality, self-driving vehicles, UAVs, social networks,
    networks applications, and services are not without consequences. As a matter
    of fact, the network bandwidth and speed limit performance and effectiveness of
    cloud computing especially for real-time and mission-critical applications cannot
    be guaranteed. Moreover, cloud computing can be hardly adapted or applied to various
    types of technologies and applications scenarios (Zhou et al., 2017). To address
    these issues, various extensions of central cloud computing have been proposed
    by industrial and academics to move computing and storage at the edge of the network
    close to users. Fog computing uses network elements between the central cloud
    and the edge of network and absolute edge elements such as microcontrollers close
    to sensors to process and store data with a distributed manner close to nodes.
    Whereas, with the developments of mobile devices, some new paradigms close to
    mobiles users have been proposed. For example, cloudlets or micro data centers
    are geographically implanted and accessible by means of Wi-Fi protocols; but,
    this approach does not always guarantee enough network quality. Manufacturers
    of cellular network equipment have proposed the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm
    that associates fog servers with base stations to provide services to mobile devices.
    MEC associated with 5G allows to combine an ultra-low latency network with high
    available bandwidth, and processing resources accessible in the vicinity. The
    MEC original concept has been extended then to wireless networks and consequently
    renamed in “Multi-access Edge Computing” (Wang et al., 2020). Agriculture has
    previously undergone two waves of revolution. The first one was mechanization
    and the second was called the green revolution with genetic modifications (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). Since the late 1990s, the digital transformation of the
    agriculture in Agriculture 3.0 also called Precision Agriculture has begun with
    the integration of Geographical Information System (GIS), Global Positioning Systems
    (GPS), and the usage of sensors have invaded agriculture. They allowed the emergency
    of image processing, techniques using deep learning, and machine learning in the
    field of computer vision. This latter is implemented to discriminate weed, identify
    crops, detect diseases,…etc. The production of a large amount of data by agriculture
    3.0 has required the development of big data technologies to process them, reflecting
    important changes in various fields of research. Collected data must be recorded
    in a specific format in order to discover patterns, curate errors, eliminate duplicated
    or inconsistent data, or solve noise problems (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Smart
    Farming also called Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is a domain of IoT in
    full growth which bring innovative paths to improve the adaptability, the efficiency,
    and the resilience of the agriculture of production systems (Iaksch et al., 2021)
    boost competitiveness and profit (Triantafyllou et al., 2019), allocate resources
    reasonably, and avoid food waste (Zhai et al., 2020, Wolfert et al., 2017) thanks
    to the contribution of autonomous context awareness provided by sensors and the
    capability to execute autonomous or remote actions (Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart
    Farming displaces the strict application from the farm location to affect related
    fields such as decision making by farmers, biodiversity, supply chains management,
    food availability and quality, insurance, and research in environment and earth
    sciences,… Smart Farming is distinct from other domains of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) by the observation and action of biological objects (animals or plants).
    It differs from medical IoT by the fact that there are no issues related to privacy;
    but, the confidentiality of data is related to production processes. Like most
    areas of the IoT, Wireless Sensing and Actuating Network (WSAN) use Low-power
    and Lossy Network organized in hierarchical routing to collect data and actuate
    devices. Multi-path routing protocols can also be implemented to balance the data
    transfer load and conserve the energy of limited battery life, basic computational
    skills, unique communication identifier, and resources-constrained nodes. Due
    to the limited battery life, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to recharge
    or replace (Debauche et al., 2021). Moreover, energy-saving and ambient energy
    techniques must be applied to deal with the active and inactive operational time
    and schedule information transmission (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). To which objects
    can be added like connected agricultural vehicles, milking robots, Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) commonly known as drones, Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) also called
    robots, mobile devices such as tablets used to encode punctual observations (Debauche
    et al., 2021), and external sources such as public geo-services (Triantafyllou
    et al., 2019). The use of IoT in agriculture 4.0 ranges from family farming as
    for example in India on a very small scale with a few low-cost sensors and actuators
    to very large scales with thousands of expensive commercial sensors and many connected
    agricultural pieces of machineries as in the American mid-west. Smart Farming
    is characterized as aforementioned by a wide variety of objects that can produce
    the highly contrasted amounts of data from few bytes/s to Gb/s. In addition, the
    availability of network protocols in rural areas to transmit this data impact
    also the type of architecture to implement. Applications need treatments in real-time
    and/or at a different time. The ”real-time” requirements are also very variable
    depending on the use case. For instance, remote control of drones requires reaction
    times of at most a few milliseconds while the Variable Rate Fertilizer (VRF) or
    Variable Spraying (VS) application aim to optimize nutrients and herbicides application
    respectively need reaction time in a range of few milliseconds to few seconds.
    The real-time processing for monitoring a herd of cattle is of the order of a
    few minutes to a few hours. The data retention time is very variable and is highly
    dependent on each use case. For example, UAVs produce tremendous quantities of
    images to transfer to the cloud in real-time where they must be quickly processed
    and stored. They can also be post-processed to extract additional data in batch
    processing. While UGVs images lose their value after processing and eventually
    actuating. However, if data is of a special, new or exceptional nature, it can
    be stored with a view, for example, to improving artificial intelligence algorithms.
    Other sensors transmit data only when anomalies are detected while others transmit
    at regular intervals a tiny amount of data. However, the adoption of Smart Farming
    is hampered by the lack of models to guide stakeholders on how to implement and
    to deploy dense and heterogeneous IoT-based monitoring systems and manage their
    interoperability (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Commercial sensors are very expensive
    making it impossible for small farms to implement them (Garcia et al., 2020).
    In addition, two trends are currently opposed. That coming from the manufacturers
    of agricultural machinery who have developed their ecosystems and who want to
    extend the services offered to farmers by attracting them into the captive ecosystems
    in which they are locked. Furthermore, another trend is the development of open
    ecosystems in which farmers can preserve the ownership of their data and keep
    control of the processing carried out on this data and of their use. On one hand,
    farmers are therefore faced with a dilemma where they are in any case forced to
    use agricultural equipment that collects their data against their will; on the
    other hand, they want to keep control of their data collected through IoT sensors.
    Currently, it is difficult to predict which of these two trends will take precedence
    over the other or whether one of the two will coexist (Wolfert et al., 2017).
    In this context, both private and public researchers can either use generic commercial
    platforms offered by cloud players on which they have limited possibilities of
    adaptation or develop their own architecture on the basis of commercial or free
    bricks, but with much greater possibilities of adaptation. In this case, the choice
    is also delicate, and a bad evaluation of the constraints can jeopardize the research
    project. Due to the recent advances in big data, we present a survey that provides
    an overview of the state of the art regarding Smart Farming. It aims at summarizing
    parameters that condition the choice of architecture to collect, process, and
    store agricultural data. Since there is a wide variety of use cases, it is important
    to make an informed choice when it comes to architecture. In this way, we address
    the current gap in the literature with a review of cloud architecture used in
    Agriculture 4.0 to collect, process, and store data to enlighten the reader about
    the possible choices and the new trends that emerge. The rest of this paper is
    structured as follows: The second section is composed of two parts. In the first
    part, we summarize related previous review in the domain and their contributions,
    in order to contextualize our contribution to the literature. In the second part,
    we identify architectures implemented in Agriculture 4.0 use cases. In the third
    section, we describe the methodology used to identify papers, the conceptual framework
    used to analyze the literature, and the criteria used to compare the selected
    architectures. In the fourth section, we present architectures used to collect,
    process, and store data. We describe successively the cloud-centric architectures,
    the extension of cloud paradigm, the distributed architecture. In the fifth section,
    new trends and futures directions are presented. In the sixth section, we discuss
    the future evolution of Agriculture 4.0 to Agriculture 5.0. Finally, the last
    section concludes this paper with recommendations and perspectives. 2. Related
    works We begin our review by identifying the previous review realized in the field
    of Internet of Things applied to Smart Agriculture to take stock of the state
    of art and highlighting aspects that have not been explored at the present time.
    In this section, we focus to achieve two objectives. The first aims to position
    our work in relation to the existing literature. The second aims to identify architectures
    commonly used in the case of applications in Agriculture 4.0. 2.1. Previous reviews

    2021) In the following paragraphs, we will draw a panoramic summary of the existing
    reviews during the past four years (2017–2021). In 2017, Ray (Ray, 2017) reviewed
    throughout his paper IoT applications and the challenges that have been faced
    while IoT deployment to improve farming. Talavera. et al. (Talavera et al., 2017)
    reviewed agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) for monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Tzounis et
    al. conducted a survey of IoT technologies in agriculture and the challenges that
    farmers face going forward (Tzounis et al., 2017). Elijah et al. identified the
    most encountered challenges in the field of IoT applications in smart agriculture
    and presented common trends for innovative ideas (Elijah et al., 2018). In 2019,
    Ayaz et al. provided a state-of-art about IoT-based architectures applied in agriculture
    and identified present and future trends in the same field of study (Ayaz et al.,
    2019). Farooq et al. presented the ingredients of IoT-based smart farming with
    used technologies that apply the utilization of network architecture and protocols;
    in addition to that, they provided an overview of the regulations and policies
    of the use of IoT in farming regarding security and privacy. They concluded their
    study by summarizing the main challenges encountered in this discipline (Farooq
    et al., 2019). Feng et al. provided an overview of the wireless communication
    technologies in the precision agriculture domain. They benchmarked the prospection
    and challenges of existing technologies with the regular communication time used
    (Feng et al., 2019). Shafi et al. conducted a literature review about IoT-based
    automation of agriculture along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). These authors
    presented a case study based upon two models: 1- a WSN to monitor real-time crop
    of health conditions, 2- system-base remote sensing imagery to classification
    between healthy and unhealthy yield (Shafi et al., 2019). In terms of agriculture
    protection, Shi et al. drew a panoramic review during the last decade to address
    the challenge and future works to further the research in the field of protected
    agriculture (Shi et al., 2019). Khanna et Kaur called into an evolutionary scenario
    to highlight the most significant impact of IoT in Precision Agriculture (PA).
    They evaluated the contribution of their predecessors and enhanced the challenges
    to open up a new direction of inspiration and innovation in IoT applied to PA
    (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). Ruan et al. reviewed literature works from 2009 to 2018
    to suggest new ideas for folks interested to conduct research in the field of
    agriculture IoT, infrastructures, data security, and data sharing (Ruan et al.,
    2019). In 2020, two studies have been carried out about 20 UAV applications that
    are devoted to either aerial crop monitoring processes or spraying tasks (Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al., 2020) and about the dilemmas that researchers must overcome while deploying
    IoT in the green agriculture domain (Ferrag et al., 2020). Villa-Henriksen et
    al. identified different challenges encountered during the implementation of IoT
    in various applications and proposed different solutions to address them (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Misra et al. discuss the role of IoT and big data analysis in Smart
    Farming (Misra et al., 2020). In 2021, a recent study conducted by Friha et al.
    hypothesize the use, application, classification, and comparison of the most developed
    emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV), Wireless Technologies, open-source IoT platforms, Software Defined Networking
    (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, cloud/fog computing,
    and middleware platforms (Friha et al., 2021). In the same year, Debauche et al.
    conducted a literature review to describe the main components of IoT and its applications
    in the field of Smart Farming (Debauche et al., 2021). 2.2. Platforms implemented
    in use cases We grouped applications into 4 categories: (1) Water Management in
    which we have aggregate all types of water use such as irrigation and watering
    animals. (2) Plant Disease and Pest groups all use cases in plant’s pathologies
    detection and treatment of plant pathologies (spraying of fungicides, pesticides,
    etc). (3) Crop Management brings together all the use cases relating to cropping
    operations: soil management (plowing, fertilizer application), sowing, weeding,
    and harvesting. (4) Livestock includes everything related to the breeding of farm
    animals (nutrition, behavior, diseases, treatments). Table 2 summarizes platform
    used to implement use cases in Smart Farming classified following our four categories.

    in Smart Irrigation in which they showed that data is stored in the database or
    in the cloud. On 151 reviewed papers, one uses Raspberry Pi, 18 databases, 53
    clouds, and 79 are self-developed or not mentioned (Garcia et al., 2020). Navarro
    et al. identified 21 Platforms used in 50 various use cases classified into 5
    categories: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Machine Learning, Computer Vision,
    and Other/Not Identified (Navarro et al., 2020). Jayaraman et al. present SmartFarmNet,
    an IoT platform offering effortless integration of sensors, supporting scalable
    data analytics, and proposing do-it-yourself tools to analyze and visualize data
    (Jayaraman et al., 2016). Codeluppi et al. describe LoRaFarM a general architecture
    modulated depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements (Codeluppi
    et al., 2020). The monitoring of crops particularly more sensitive to them as
    saffron is crucial. The DIAS Architecture (Triantafyllou et al., 2019) uses different
    ground and leaf sensors to monitor the real-time 24/24 h cultivation process of
    saffron. This data is transmitted by LoRaWAN with IPv6 protocol and MQTT-SN protocol
    to FIWARE’s context broker. The broker manages all networking devices by means
    of sixteen types of messages exchanged following publish-subscribe model. The
    FIWARE NGSI API of oversees the consumption, subscription, and processing of all
    the information collected and its publication. Afterward, the data is stored and
    analyzed with a random forest algorithm which allows extracting information about
    the crop growth and health. Vegetation indexes: Normalized Difference Index (NDI),
    Excess Greenness Index (ExG) are calculated with PiX4D3 image processing tools.
    Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is used to recognize weeds or discriminate
    species. Finally, collected data are categorized and evaluated accordingly with
    vegetation index values, moisture level, and plant developing state by means of
    the Apache Spark framework for the Big Data analysis and Waikato Environment (WEKA)
    a framework specialized in data mining to produce reports and predictions. Decision-making
    is a very important task in the farmers’ activities but with the amount of data
    always increasing, they encounter difficulties on one hand to make proper decision
    about agricultural management and on the other hand translate this data into practical
    knowledge (Zhai et al., 2020). On the other hand, there is a need for platforms
    of the Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) to assist farmers to make precise
    decisions evidence-based. For example, Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture
    combines IBM Watson with IoT and Cloud Computing to detect crop disease from UAV
    images. It is also possible to optimize time for crop operations to obtain a better
    price on trading market. The second example is Digital Farming System4 takes advantage
    of computer vision, cloud computing, and AI to propose a better timing for corp
    operations, notify when a crop is infected by any disease. Smart Irrigation Decision
    Support System (SIDSS) is composed on one hand of a set of sensors and a weather
    station and on the other hand a DSS based on two machine learning algorithms.
    Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to deduct unnecessary variables and Adaptive
    Neuro -Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) used to minimize estimated errors under
    a target threshold (Navarro-Hellin et al., 2016). SIDSS generates planning of
    water amount and time for irrigation. Multi-robot sense-act system (Conesa-Munoz
    et al., 2016) is a planner of aerial and ground vehicles which assign tasks to
    the most appropriate work units. A Harmony Search Algorithm is used to optimize
    plans for UAVs while meta heuristic is running for ground vehicles. 2.3. Analysis
    of previous literature The analysis of existing reviews about smart farming shows
    that applications use whether open source or commercial cloud architecture whether
    developing specific architecture responding to their aims or do not describe their
    storage and processing system. The latter represents more than half of the papers
    and means that some of the processing architectures remain unknown because they
    have never been specifically described and studied. Moreover, the fact that further
    development is being made in architecture may be the fact that commercial platforms
    do not fully address the needs of Agriculture 4.0. This brings us to our research
    questions and their respective motivation: 1. Which storage and processing architectures
    are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address its particularities?
    Motivation: On one hand generic architectures dedicated or not to IoT are able
    to address a large number of use cases but not specifically the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 exist. On the other hand, researchers develop architectures to address specific
    issues or requirements of use cases. The selection of an adapted architecture
    is crucial for the correct implementation of identified use cases. 2. Can generic
    architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? Motivation:
    Agriculture 4.0 has specific requirements described in the introduction section
    which cannot all be addressed by a single classical generic architecture. A comparison
    between the pros and the cons of major generic architecture in the context of
    agriculture 4.0 is important to highlight the choice during the conceptualization
    step. 3. What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that allow the transition
    from research to industrialization? Motivation: The use of architectural solutions
    which can be for example free of fees during the research phase but needs a reimplementation
    caused by license limitations, the cost of the license in the use cases budget,
    etc. The use of products in closed or semi-closed ecosystems is a barrier to the
    research valuation. 4. What are the vertical valuation possibilities to move from
    algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded or autonomous products? Motivation:
    The massive collection of data in the cloud allows to development of complex algorithms
    that need a large amount of computing resources to be elaborated. Afterward, they
    can be compressed, reduced, optimized in order to be deployed in embedded devices
    or divided and establish a collaboration between devices and computing resources
    such as cloud, fog, etc. In order to answer these questions, a review of the literature
    will make it possible to synthesize the different approaches currently used, to
    identify new trends and to consider new lines of research to be explored. 3. Methodology
    In order to address, our first and second research questions, we achieve a systematic
    review to identify generic architectures and combination of architectural elements
    used by researchers to implement concrete use cases. Moreover, we attempt also
    identify commercial products and existing services/ platforms used to implement
    projects in agriculture. 3.1. Systematic review methodology The research questions
    outlined at the end of the related work section has been addressed by combining
    keywords of the first group that refers to architectures (i.e. cloud architecture,
    distributed architecture, big data, Internet of Things, IoT) and of the second
    group contained keywords related to agriculture (i.e. agriculture, smart farming,
    food, agri-food, precision agriculture). Our methodology is based on 3 consecutive
    steps: literature identification, reading literature, and information extraction.
    During the first step, we have read and have collected individual papers based
    on the achieved of previous papers. We have reviewed and completed by a systematic
    survey of white literature (full articles and conference papers) from January
    2016 to December 2020. In addition, we targeted solely and exclusively papers
    written in English and focusing on architecture design have been considered. Our
    bibliographic review was limited to the last 5 years because the rapid development
    of IoT. The systematic review was retrieved from the following major bibliographic
    databases: Scopus (Elsevier), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Wiley Online Library,
    ACM Digital Library, and Springer. These bibliographic databases have been chosen
    widely covering relevant bibliography and relevant advanced bibliometric features
    especially number of citation and relevant literature suggestion. From these databases
    1058 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. After their screening 55 papers were
    classified relevant while remaining articles were considerate not relevant and
    therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. The high number of excluded
    papers is due to numerous papers describe i.e. conceptual or theoretic architectures
    which were never implemented, experimental architectures that have been the subject
    of a single article or that have never been proven by other research teams. We
    discard also papers that were not a directly related Big data and the agricultural
    sector. Table 3. Table 3. Keywords used for achieved the systematic review. Area

    (reports, blogs, magazines, and web-items) into our review using Web of Science
    and Google Scholar. Table 4. We discarded papers that were written in other languages
    than English, Master and doctoral dissertation, and duplicated articles gathered
    from Google Scholar. Afterward, we have selected literature that has carefully
    been read in detail to extract relevant information of research questions. The
    extracted information was analyzed and summarized in a conceptual framework illustrated
    in the Fig. 1. Table 4. Sources of collected literature. Data source URL IEEE

    Three ways of treatment of data are possible. The first process data in real-time
    (left branch identified by (1) on Fig. 1), this one is generally not stored except
    eventually particular or exceptional data in order to enrich the training database
    of artificial intelligence algorithms. This way of data treatment is used for
    example by robots that inspect a crop, discover a pest, and then eliminate it.
    After intervention the value data is near null. The second way is a mixed way
    in which data must be processed as quickly as possible. This one addresses use
    cases where latency required must be comprised between few milliseconds to few
    seconds with data, which conserves a value during a certain period of time. This
    latter justifies its storage according to the use case data management plan that
    predicts the time after which the data will be aggregated and then deleted. This
    way in identified by (2) on Fig. 1. It addresses use cases where all data must
    be processed and then stored for eventual post-processing for example to estimate
    trends of parameters such as the milk quality, volume of palatable species available
    in a pasture. The third way is stored data theirs native format without transformation
    (Identified by (3) on Fig. 1). This way is implemented on use cases that do not
    require real time processing or use cases where the amount data is so important,
    which makes treatment impossible. In this latter case, data are consumed by micro
    services that sample data to exact knowledge. This way is also employed for data
    which have a low value or lose their value so quickly that there is no point in
    transforming them for long-term storage. For instance, a UGV identifies and eliminates
    a pest. The image of the insect is no longer relevant after its elimination. 3.2.
    Architecture comparison criteria In order to compare selected architectures, we
    chose to select 8 criteria:(1) User Proximity expresses the necessity to be close
    to the user. This criterion is important for applications where privacy and response
    time to query are critical. Attribute a value of one * when privacy is not crucial;
    ** when the proximity with user is desirable but not crucial for the development
    of the use case; *** when the user proximity is the corner stone of the application.
    (2) Latency & Jitter criterion describes the importance for the architecture to
    have a minimal latency and jitter. This criterion is particularly important for
    use cases where response time to query in quasi (real time) is required and/or
    time between data production and ingestion by the processing and storage architecture
    is essential. (3) Network stability criterion translate the necessity to have
    a stable network or if is interruption can be tolerated. Use a value of * if the
    use case implemented can tolerate the absence of network during few hours; **
    if few minutes of interruption are tolerable; *** is stability of the network
    is an essential element of the use case. (4) The high throughput criterion expresses
    the capability of the architecture to process quickly a wide amount of data arriving
    at high frequency; Use a value of * if the data arrive mostly at regular intervals;
    a value of ** if the data arrive in bursts, and *** if the data arrive continuously
    at high frequency ( 10 Hz). (5) Reliability is a criterion that expresses if the
    infrastructure is critical in other terms whether an interruption in infrastructure
    could cause loss of life or not. Attribute a weight of * if the data is not critical
    and potential damages caused by an interruption of the architecture are minors
    or null; ** if potential damageable but tolerable if they occur more than once
    a year; *** if the application cannot tolerate any interruption which would cause
    irreversible damage or loss of human life. (6) Scalability is a criterion that
    expresses the regularity of the evolution in terms of processing and storage during
    a period of one year. If the scalability must be achieved at most once a year
    use a weight of *; if the scalability is achieved at most twice a year use **;
    if the scalability must be achieved more than two times by year use a weight of
    ***. (7) Cost-Effectiveness criterion reflects the need to control infrastructure
    costs. This criterion is more important as the infrastructure is brought to evolve
    both in terms of scale and complexity. Use the weight of * if the project will
    remain in a relatively constant size and do not need to be scaled or dramatically
    modified; Use **, if the project evolves reasonably, i.e. should not undergo significant
    modification more than once a year. Use a weight of *** if the size of the project
    and/ or its complexity need a fine study of cost. (8) Maintainability criterion
    is directly linked to the sustainability of the project. If the sustainability
    of the project will not exceed two years to allocate a point of *; if the life
    of the project is between 2 and 5 years, assign a score of ** beyond 5 years,
    assign ***. 4. Architectures The numerous publications dealing with cloud architectures
    relating to Agriculture 4.0, summarized in Table 2, show that a great deal of
    effort has been devoted to solving a whole range of problems related to many use
    cases. Indeed, a universal and a unique architecture do not exist for IoT applications
    in Smart Agriculture which ensure all needs of all use cases. This is the reason
    why several researchers have proposed various architectures which address specific
    issues of generic architectures. The Fig. 2 gives a global overview on Agriculture
    4.0 organization. Download : Download high-res image (340KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global structure of IoT in Agriculture 4.0. 4.1. Central
    Cloud Architectures Central Cloud Architectures are based on two basic architectures
    that are associated or combined in order to form modern architectures. These two
    architectures are: Batch Architecture aims to process an entire dataset in an
    offline mode. For this type of architectures, as long as the processing of the
    dataset is not finished, it continues and produces results only when it has reached
    its end. Generally, the data is selected and distributed to different nodes in
    order to be processed more quickly. When all the treatments are achieved on all
    nodes, the results are sorted and aggregated to obtain a global output. This architecture
    is easily implemented, and the aggregation is done by a framework, but processing
    times can be long, and data extracted during the treatment cannot be processed
    before the end of the treatment in progress. Furthermore, it is possible to increment
    results of previous batch and produce a result that integrates treated data in
    progress. Sallah et al. used a batch architecture to update data within the AquaCrop
    model (FAO) embedded in R-environment in order to facilitate model calibration
    and validation, run and evaluate all fields in a single run (Sallah et al., 2019).
    Nolack Fote et al. presented an architecture to extract knowledge on the long
    term from data in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) (Fote et al., 2020). Table
    5. Table 5. Pros and Cons of Batch Architecture. Pros Cons - Easy to implement
    and maintain. - Process only data previously stored in another form (file, database,
    etc). - Able to achieve long term treatments (several hours or days). - Processing
    cannot be modified before the end of the treatment. - Reprocessing of old data
    that are easy to achieve. - Results available only at the end of the treatment.
    Real-time Architecture also named Streaming Architecture processes data as it
    arrives, and results are progressively available by opposition to the batch architecture
    where it is not necessary to wait for the end of ingestion of all input data to
    obtain a result. The notion of real-time is strongly dependent on the analysis
    context with a processing time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Real-time
    architecture can be implemented in two different ways. On one hand with micro-batch
    in which a tiny amount of data is processed each n seconds and a result is obtained
    at the end of the treatment or on the other hand with a streaming approach in
    which each new data is immediately processed and output is quickly produced. This
    architecture is limited to data flow processing (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016).
    Table 6. Table 6. Pros and Cons of Real-time Architecture. Pros Cons - Allow a
    rapid treatment of newly arrived data. - Not able to achieve processing on large
    size of the batch. - Batch processing can be emulated using micro batches but
    not all algorithms can be implemented. - Reprocessing of old data difficult to
    implement. - Easy to implement and maintain. - The need for real-time processing
    involves the use of an estimator rather than the precise values that would take
    too long to be calculated. Various data are produced by different fields or animals
    sensors, vehicles, and robots of the Agriculture 4.0. Afterward, this data must
    be on one hand stored in a raw state and processed in an offline way where long
    and complex treatments can be achieved. On the other hand, data can be processed
    before its storing with offline processing, streaming processing, or a combination
    of these ones. The storage time is extremely variable following the nature of
    the data and their loss of value over time. Offline processing is classically
    used to process images from UAVs, UGVs, or satellites, for example, to determine
    photosynthesis activity, evaluate the canopy development or stocks of palatable
    species available in a pasture, etc. While Streaming processing allows detecting
    anomalies in animals’ behaviors in real-time, or during agricultural operations
    such as the harvesting, disease and pest detection, weeds elimination. In these
    last cases, data is not stored because it quickly loses all value after its ingestion.
    Finally, a combination of the two previous ways i.e. Offline and Streaming processing
    is used to estimate real-time metrics and achieve complex treatments in an offline
    way at the same time. This approach is used by milking robots which detect anomalies
    in the production in real-time while the offline processing estimates the future
    production of each cow based on previous milking (Debauche et al., 2021). Lambda
    architectures are used in systems that need to process and expose quickly massive
    amounts of streaming data. This cloud architecture was proposed by Nathan Marz
    and James Warren (Marz and Warren, 2013) to handle tremendous quantities of data
    and resolve complex problems combining processing large volumes of data (Batch)
    while incorporating the most recent data processed in real-time processes (Singh
    et al., 2019). This architecture is generic, scalable, and fault-tolerant against
    hardware failures and human mistakes. The architecture is composed of three layers:
    (1) batch layer process very large quantities of data by batch; (2) speed layer
    which processes data in real-time and provides views based on the most recent
    data and (3) serving layer responding to queries. Data comes from either a data
    source or a message queue. This paradigm allows executing arbitrary queries over
    any real-time data and is particularly adapted for critical infrastructure and
    health systems (Diaz et al., 2016). Several implementations of Lambda Architecture
    in smart Environment management, big data storage and analytics can be found in
    (Villari et al., 2014). Among the criticisms that have been made against lambda
    architecture is the need to make twice the developments for the real-time branch
    and the batch branch. It is possible to perform a batch processing and in real
    time with flow processing is what the Kappa architecture described below does
    (Kreps, 2014). Fig. 3 Table 7. Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download

    Pros and Cons of Lambda Architecture. Pros Cons - Process data in real-time or
    in batch processing in separate ways. The reliability of two ways of treatment
    is most costly than other architectures if the two execute the same treatment.
    Among use cases in agriculture 4.0 using a lambda, we would like to highlight:
    Roukh et al. proposed WALLeSMART, a cloud platform based on lambda and specifically
    developed for Smart Farming. This platform implements Apache Kafka to store temporary
    data before their treatment. Apache Hadoop and the programming model Mapreduce
    is used for the batch processing while Apache Storm process data in realtime.
    The originality of this architecture is the coupling of a NoSQL database Apache
    Casandra and a SQL database, PostgreSQL where data is stored in the function of
    its nature. The GraphQL query language allows to querying databases. (Roukh et
    al., 2020, Roukh et al., 2020). Debauche et al. describe a lambda architecture
    for digital phenotyping (Debauche et al., 2020) and farm animals’ behaviors coupled
    with an Application Hosting Architecture based on Apache Mesos and Docker containerization
    to facilitate the deployment of various applications. An API interconnects and
    controls accesses between the Lambda Architecture and the Hosting Application
    Architecture. The Lambda architecture is based on Apache Beam to easily change
    the runner in the function of the technology evolution and improve its sustainability.
    Apache Druid is used to store time series data (Debauche et al., 2019) and metadata
    of data stored in the Datalake based on Apache Hadoop (Debauche et al., 2018).
    A variant of this architecture, named Unified Lambda architecture combines batch
    and stream pipelines which runs concurrently, and then the results are merged
    automatically (Siciliani, 2015). AllJoyn Lambda integrates AllJoyn a framework
    that offers: (1) proximal devices and applications discovering; (2) specific devices
    framework adapting; (3) transmission between devices with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.;
    (4) interoperability between operating systems; (5) efficient and secure data
    exchange through D-BUS (Villari et al., 2014). The Kappa architecture, proposed
    by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps, 2014), simplifies the Lambda architecture by
    combining real-time and batch layers. This cloud architecture differs from the
    Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent storage system of data in an unchangeable
    log file such as system as Apache Spark or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow
    only storage for a limited time in order to allow an eventual reprocessing of
    these data. Batch and Speed Layers are also replaced by a stream processing engine.
    So, the Kappa Architecture is composed of two layers: streaming and serving layers
    and can be implemented with a publish-subscribe messaging like Apache Kafka, which
    facilitates data ingestion. Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (121KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Kappa Architecture General Scheme.
    The main advantage of this architecture is its simplicity. It avoids having to
    maintain two separate code bases for the batch and speed layers. When processing
    on real-time and historical data are the same, a Kappa Architecture must be used.
    Fast Data Architecture is a variant of Kappa Architecture in which the data are
    no longer read from files but from an additional mechanism like Kafka that captures
    multiple streams combines them before being processed by the speed layer (Lakhe,
    2016). Persico et al. achieved a benchmark of Lambda and Kappa architectures and
    show that Lambda outperforms Kappa for social networks data (YFCC100M) processing
    (Persico et al., 2018). Table 8. Table 8. Pros and Cons of Kappa Architecture.
    Pros Cons - Very efficient for real-time processing thanks to in-memory processing.
    - Batch processing emulates thanks to micro-batch treated via the real-time way.
    - Optimized cost because allows real-time and batch processing. - Not able to
    process large batch size. - Must be finely tuned from data to obtain the best
    performances (Nkamla Penka et al., 2021). Other Architectures derived or inspired
    of the previous architectures have been developed to address specific problems
    such as (1) SMACK (Estrada and Ruiz, 2016) which attempts to propose an optimal
    architecture with fixed components; (2) Liquid (Fernandez et al., 2015) is an
    architecture which provide low latency, incremental processing, high available
    with isolated resource, and able to store high throughput data at low operational
    cost architecture; (3) Butterfly (Lakhe, 2016) proposes to unify batch, speed
    and serving layers in a unique platform in which data are organized as a collection
    of three types of abstractions; (4) Zeta (Scott, 2015) which integrates a lambda
    architecture with business aspect of the enterprise; (5) BRAID (Giebler et al.,
    2018) is a hybrid processing architecture where all coming data and configuration
    file of processing, and eventually processing results written back are stored
    in a shared storage; (6) IoT-a (Hausenblas, 2014) is composed of three blocks:
    Ad-hoc queries, a Database, and a Distributed File System; (7) Polystore (Meehan
    et al., 2016) implements a multiple database system PostgreSQL, SciDB and Accumulo
    because a database alone cannot store all types of data efficiently. Table 9.

    analysis of the literature achieved shows that two major generic architectures:
    Kappa and Lambda allows to address of various use cases and are widely implemented
    and proven in other domains of the Internet of Things. The Lambda is more expensive
    to implement than the Kappa because of the need to maintain two separate parallel
    processing branches for stream processing and batch processing. It is interesting
    if different processing are carried out on the two processing branches. Otherwise,
    a Kappa architecture with a single processing branch that processes both the streams
    and the data in batches is more appropriate in most cases because it is cheaper
    and easier to maintain because a single code performs both types of processing
    (stream and batch). Looking at our first two research questions, we observe that
    Lambda and Kappa cloud architectures are efficient but these architectures alone
    operating in central cloud cannot address, for example, use cases where very low
    latencies are required. They will have to be hybridized and completed to address
    these particular cases. Two possibilities are available to us. The first way consists
    in associating several specialized cloud platforms to make it possible to obtain
    greater genericity or at least to better cover a domain. The second consists of
    supplementing the cloud-centric architectures that we have just mentioned with
    other architectural elements in order to better address the specific needs of
    Agriculture 4.0. 4.2. Extension of the cloud paradigm With the increase of the
    amount of data produced by the myriad of connected things, the amount of data
    to process, to transfer by network, and to treat in the cloud computing have called
    into question the architecture of storage and data processing. To solve the problem,
    two ways have been proposed, the first is Multi-Cloud Computing, the objective
    of which is to ensure redundancy in order to improve latency. The second is the
    Federated Cloud with the aim of pooling resources for better use. Multi-Cloud
    Computing (MCC) (Manyika and Chui, 2015) is an extension of Cloud Computing paradigm
    where services are distributed on multi-clouds. In this architecture the workflow
    is distributed entirely in the cloud, data redundancy is also verified. One advantage
    of the MCC is the high recovery rate but it has the same disadvantages as Cloud
    Computing, along with complexity and portability issues. Kazim et al. proposed
    a framework to deliver IoT services and establish cooperation across multi-clouds.
    An authentication allows communicating cloud to authenticate each other cloud
    dynamically. While a service selects the best IoT service matching with user requirements
    among multiple clouds and taking into account the SLA parameters agreed between
    the user and the provider (Kazim et al., 2018). Federated Cloud (FC) aggregates
    resources of multiple cloud providers to improve users’ freedom and allows users
    to choose where they want to deploy their applications. A Federated cloud can
    be defined as a voluntary collaboration between heterogeneous cloud providers
    collaborating to share their own unused resources. Using a cloud federation helps
    to ensure service performance during load ups with resources borrowed from other
    clouds. In addition, the geographical dispersion of the installations makes it
    possible to migrate to another installation and to guarantee the service in case
    of breakdown. A unified interface allows to use it an easy consultation of the
    offered services. Finally, thanks to the dynamic distribution of the load, it
    is possible to bring the treatment closer to the user and consequently improve
    the Quality of Service (Assis and Bittencourt, 2016). Cloud federations include
    European Federated Cloud (Sipos et al., 2013), Massachusetts Open Cloud, Mosaic
    (Petcu et al., 2013), IEEE P2302, and Open stack Keystone. Drakos et al. described
    agINFA, a common research data infrastructure for agriculture, food and the environment
    using EGI Federated Cloud. This infrastructure allows to partner to share research
    infrastructure components, APIs, a registry of web-based information service and
    dataset for agriculture (Drakos et al., 2015). 4.3. Distributed architectures
    The post-cloud approaches allow to improve latency and jitter for immobile entities
    but do not provide an answer adapted for mobile devices and local awareness. The
    large amount of data generated at the edge has increased the speed of data transportation
    that is becoming the bottleneck for the cloud-based computing paradigms (Shi et
    al., 2016). Moreover, the treatment of data in the cloud does not offer any guarantees
    about privacy, on the response time and real-time actuation because the huge number
    of devices increases the latency and jitter. Moreover, the mobility of devices
    and power constraints makes the communicaion difficult with the cloud all the
    time (Botta et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2017). The aim has been to bring data storage
    and processes data, filtering, and data analysis closer to data-producing objects
    to limit bandwidth consumption and relieve the cloud. Three major paradigms have
    been proposed to address these issues and bring cloud computing-like capabilities
    to the edge of the network. All these infrastructures manage mechanisms of Virtual
    Machine (VM) or containers migration and adjust if needed, the provisioning of
    capabilities where users are located. Moreover, the three paradigms allow the
    creation of federated infrastructures in which can coexist multiple edge infrastructures
    which can exchange information and services (Roman et al., 2018). 4.4. Elements
    of distributed architectures In order to always bring closer, the processing capacities
    of intermediate processing have been set up between connected objects and the
    cloud at the network level (Fog Computing) and at the level of telephony providers
    (Mobile Edge Computing). Fog Computing is a concept created by Cisco Systems and
    is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm (Munir et al., 2017) in which
    computation, storage and network services are provided between end devices and
    cloud/ classify and analyze the raw IoT data streams at near-edge and edge network
    level (Cisco, 2018). Fog nodes are either physical components such as gateways,
    switches, routers, servers etc. or virtual components such as virtualized switches,
    virtual machines, cloudlets, etc.; deployed following private, community, public
    or hybrid. Private nodes are reserved for a single organization, community nodes
    are used by a community, public nodes are dedicated to the general public, and
    hybrid mix the third previous modalities (Uehara, 2017). This paradigm allows
    to limit data transfer on cloud, reduce latency (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), and
    jitter thanks to a three-tier architecture (Roman et al., 2018). In this hierarchical
    architecture, the analysis of local information is achieved at the low level and
    the coordination and global analysis are performed at the top level. The Fog Computing
    supports mobile devices (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), response time in real-time
    or predictable latency (Lopez et al., 2015), bandwidth saving, an improving of
    security and resilience, scalability, multi-tenancy, advanced analytics, and automation
    (Byers, 2017), cost-effective services (Yang, 2017). Fog Computing allows also
    the federation of fog infrastructures in order to allow cooperation between multiple
    organizations (Roman et al., 2018). Furthermore, the architecture is optimized
    for a use case and applications which must run on them (Byers, 2017). Fog Computing
    differentiates from cloud computing mainly by the proximity with end-users at
    the edge of networks localized or distributed geographically consisting in many
    relatively less resourceful (Munir et al., 2017). In addition to network equipment,
    fog computing can also be carried out in cloudlets and micro data centers. Cloudlets
    were proposed to address the end-to-end responsiveness between mobile devices
    and associated clouds. Cloudlets (Mach and Becvar, 2017) are micro data center
    geographically deployed in vicinity of End Users. This mobility-enhanced small-scale
    cloud data center is composed of computers with high computation power which provide
    both computation resources and storage. Cloudlet is much more agile (highly dynamic
    provisioning) than cloud due to user mobility churning. The mobility of users
    implies the use of a virtual machine to rapidly instantiate compute-intensive
    and latency-intensive applications and migrate the offloaded services between
    different cloudlet in the function of the user mobility. Cloudlets must be firstly
    discovered, selected among several candidates before starting provisioning. At
    the end of the session, the instance is destroyed (Ai et al., 2018). Cloudlets
    are accessed by mobile user equipment via Wi-Fi imply a high latency caused by
    the network and switch between mobile network and Wi-Fi and by consequence Quality
    of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) are hard to fulfill (Mach and
    Becvar, 2017, Manyika and Chui, 2015). Moreover, Cloudlets cover usually a small
    region and do not offer any guarantee on ubiquitous computing and scalability
    in service (Manyika and Chui, 2015). MicroData Centers (MDCs) were proposed by
    Microsoft Research. It is designed to extend cloud data centers as cloudlets.
    MDCs are enclosures contemning all types of equipments (computing, storage, network)
    needed to provide a secure computing environment in order to run customs applications
    requiring low latency. MDCs are also well adapted to provide processing resources
    to end devices on battery or with limited computing capabilities. MDCs can be
    adapted in function network bandwidth and user needs thanks to certain flexibility
    in terms of latency and scalability of the capacity (Wang et al., 2020). Guardo
    et al. proposed a framework composed of two fog layers respectively filtering
    and aggregating data, and clustering analysis, actuation management, and alert.
    The framework aims to improve computational load balancing between fog and cloud
    in order to reduce the amount of data to transmit to the cloud, reduce the waiting
    time for the user (Guardo et al., 2018). Taneja et al. proposed a SmartHerd an
    IoT platform dedicated to smart dairy farming based on microservices and Fog-assisted.
    The IoT gateway received data from transceivers, archived data aggregation, preprocessing,
    classification, feature selection, send critical alerts to farmers, and transmit
    data to IBM Watson IoT platform via MQTT protocol. In the IBM Watson IoT platform,
    a broker picks up data and store them in a Cloudant NoSQL JSON Database. Python
    Virtual Machine and Java Virtual Machine were used as containers equivalent for
    microservices deployment at fog level (Taneja et al., 2019). Sharofidinov et al.
    described a 4 layers architecture (Sensors Layers, Fog Layer, Network/Cloud Layer,
    and Application Layer) based on LoRa to monitor and predict the state of a greenhouse
    from a random forest algorithm. In the Sensor Layer, sensors acquire temperature,
    soil and air humidity, CO2 rate, and illumination connected to TTGO LoRa32 (ESP32
    with LoRa Sx1276 chip) which are transmitted to the gateway by LoRa. At Fog Layer,
    preliminary analysis with Machine Learning algorithm, diagnosis of sensor status,
    and data compression are achieved. In the Network/Cloud Layer, compressed data
    are transmitted in order to be deeply analyzed and stored. Finally, in the Application
    Layer, analyzed data are converted in readable form to allows the monitoring and
    the control of the greenhouse (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Table 10. Table 10.
    Pros and Cons of Fog Computing. Pros Cons - Fast response time in avoiding transmission
    of data to the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). - Failure or outage of the gateway
    can defeat thousands of devices. - The local storage and processing capabilities
    prevent data loss and outages when the Internet connectivity is limited (Sharofidinov
    et al., 2020). - The limited processing and memory capacities do not allow the
    deployment of algorithms requiring significant resources or the carrying out of
    long-term processing. - Sensitive data can be filtered locally. In this case,
    only the data model is moved in the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020), and data
    validation, compression, and encryption. - Gateway at fog level ensure the compatibility
    between old and modern devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020) and various protocols
    for communication. - Improve the resilience thanks to the decentralization of
    the treatment on network devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) was proposed by ETSI and is deployed by telecommunication companies on the
    edge of the network, which is characterized by ultra-low latency and high bandwidth.
    (Roman et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2017). At the very beginning, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) aims to bring real-time, high-bandwidth, and low-latency access to dependent
    applications known as cloud computing capabilities; in addition to, information
    technology (IT) features of cloud computing. MEC is distributed at the edge of
    the network. In fact, a new class of cloud-native applications are easily accessible,
    because of the close position of Edge Computing to the end user and apps. Also,
    it allows network operators to open their environment to a new ecosystem. As a
    result of this significant change, MEC application can be used in LTE macro base
    stations (eNBs), 3G radio network controllers (RNCs), Wi-Fi access points, edge
    network routers, and enterprise edge servers. MEC platform contains two main hosting
    infrastructures. The first is formed by hardware resources and a high-resolution
    screen. The second is composed of manageable applications with numerous capabilities
    such as the application of virtualization manager and platform services (Zhou
    et al., 2017). An important challenge for the MEC is the VM migration that must
    optimize the tradeoff between migration gain and migration cost and select optimal
    location (Ai et al., 2018). Tran et al. investigated the collaborative Mobile
    Edge Computing in 5G Networks. MEC extends processing and storage resources at
    the edge of the Radio Access Network (RAN) while C-RAM is based on centralization
    of the base Station by means of the virtualization. Authors argue that both technologies
    are complementary in the 5G ecosystem (Tran et al., 2017). Fig. 5 Table 11. Download

    Mobile Edge Computing General Scheme. Table 11. Pros and Cons of MEC. Pros Cons
    - Reduces needs in connection, response time delay, the congestion of other parts
    of the network (Valecce et al., 2019). - Usable only for devices connected in
    Wi-Fi or 3GPP. - Use low level message from Wi-Fi to determine the location of
    each device (Location awareness) (Valecce et al., 2019). - MEC Server can be used
    as power open to applications and services (Valecce et al., 2019). Fan et al.
    combined MEC with data link management, combining with the industrial CAN bus
    characteristics to monitor water. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) Altera
    implementing the AVALON bus was used to implement the system. Moreover, they propose
    a protocol to model random network disturbances and an online task offloading
    algorithm based on the monitoring of task execution (Fan and Gao, 2018). Valecce
    et al. proposed a 5G-robotics reference architecture for smart agriculture composed
    of UAV-Based Monitoring and connectivity, Machinery automation, and MEC Applications
    Server. UAVs/satellites capture high-resolution images during patrolling, which
    coupled with sensors data trigger a precise crop management. UAVs can also collect
    data or serve as a 5G mobile station. In field, image processing coupled with
    sensors data can be used for decision making. MEC allows to process gigabyte/s
    of data produced by autonomous vehicles and robots (Valecce et al., 2019). Table

    ** ** Maintainability ** ** The development of fog computing and its counterpart
    for MEC wireless networks allow processing capabilities closer to users to improve

    are inherently two questions: Which association strategies to use between the
    cloud and the other levels of processing in the network? How to distribute the
    load between these different levels: local (Edge), network (Fog), and Cloud processing.
    4.5. Collaborative computing strategies In order to address, our fourth research
    question, we try to identify different possibilities to compose architectural
    elements. Indeed, different collaboration strategies between the different levels
    of data processing (cloud, fog, edge) can be considered depending on the particularities
    of the use cases. In the next paragraphs, we describe possibilities of collaboration
    between different treatment entries, and we illustrate each one with few examples.
    Edge-Cloud aims to connect devices directly with the cloud that performs data
    processing. This strategy is often used by UAVs and UGVs which preprocess data
    before its transfer to the cloud because image treatment needs processing power
    and storage capabilities. The default of this approach is that the delay of the
    whole process from data transfer via high throughput wireless or cellular protocol
    to the transmission of processing results cannot be guaranteed because of the
    fluctuation of data rates linked to wireless networks (Wang et al., 2020). The
    processing of data can be achieved in an online mode with a real-time data transmission
    and processing by a stream, Lambda, Kappa or derived architecture of these one.
    An offline strategy with a data transfer by means of a computer and Internet connection
    on the cloud after the UAV fly and processing with a Batch, a Lambda, or a Kappa
    architecture or a derived architecture of these one is also possible. This latter
    costly avoid data transmission and is suitable for monitoring crops or livestock
    that do not require direct action. Agriculture 4.0 uses in particular Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors in order to improve the time
    of data collection, in reducing the cost of acquisition compared to traditional
    field phenotyping technologies. According to Tang et al., edge-cloud is majorly
    used in smart robots to reduce complexity (Tang et al., 2021). Indeed, the images
    of drones to be used must be orthorectified and assembled. These operations require
    significant resources in terms of computing power, and memory. All these collected
    data must be rapidly processed, analyzed, and visualized. Agroview (Ampatzidis
    et al., 2020) is a platform that developed a cloud and AI-based application to
    survey and assess the agriculture field, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    A website allows the upload of images or existing orthomosaic, the consultation
    for each tree field e.g., number of trees, tree gaps count, area of the field,
    the average height of trees, canopy area, etc. The website also allows the stitching
    of an orthomosaic and the generation of a Digital Surface Model (DSM). A tree
    detection algorithm developed in C allows the detection of individual tree and
    tree gap, and estimate tree parameters such as height, canopy area, health/stress
    estimation. The pipeline of treatment uses a Faster R-CNN to detect the region
    of interest (ROI) and the ResNet101 network allows to detect trees and row orientation.
    Afterward, the Yolo classifier using Darknet19 was applied along each row of trees
    to obtain a more precise detection. Debauche et al. presented an Edge-Cloud architecture
    for the analysis of cattle behavior from 9-DOF IMU data sampled at 100 Hz and
    GPS location sampled at 0.5 Hz that is then processed with an algorithm proposed
    by (Andriamandroso et al., 2017) in batch processing (Debauche et al., 2019, Debauche
    et al., 2020). Popescu et al. proposed an integrated system UAV-WSN-IoT where
    WSN data is collected by UAVs before their transmission to the ground control
    station and afterward to the cloud (Popescu et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    an architecture for scientific research dedicated to honeybee Colony Collapse
    Disorder. In this architecture, data is compressed on LoPy at the edge level before
    its collection by the LoRaWan gateway and its transmission to the Lambda architecture
    in the cloud where it is processed (Debauche et al., 2018). Edge-Fog aims to connect
    devices directly with network components such as gateways, routers that perform
    data processing. The major benefits of this approach are an optimization of the
    bandwidth, a reduction of traffic and latency, a better privacy, and an improved
    security level (Badidi, 2020). Fog nodes collect, aggregate, filter, encrypt,
    compress, and process IoT data (Gupta et al., 2020). This way is used for example
    by milking robots where data are processed by a computer close the robot and can
    be viewed remotely by the farmer. 5G also promotes mobile edge computing (MEC).
    Debauche et al. presented an AI-IoT architecture for the deployment of Artificial
    intelligence algorithms and Internet of things services at fog level using docker
    containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. This architecture has been developed
    to automatically deploy AI algorithms after retraining when performances (accuracy,
    recall, precision) are improved (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    a Multi-Agent System (MAS) deployed at edge level allowing to control abnormal
    data present in sensed data and eventually cure this data when it is possible.
    The MAS simultaneously manages pivot irrigation, plant diseases and pests'' detection,
    and their curation. The data is partially transmitted to the cloud to improve
    the detection of diseases and pests and retrain AI algorithms before their redeployment
    at the edge level (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. described a fog architecture
    in which a Gated Recursive Unit (GRU) algorithm is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano
    for real-time poultry monitoring. GRU is simpler than LSTM algorithm. GRU is built
    to avoid varnish gradient problems. Periodically data is transmitted to the user
    interface implemented in NodeJS in the cloud (Debauche et al., 2020). Edge-Fog-Cloud
    is a paradigm in which data are partially processed in the fog and more complex
    treatments are achieved in the cloud. This way is used by wireless Sensor and
    Actuator Network (WSAN), which passes through a gateway that provides interconnection
    between the devices and the backhaul which transit then data to the cloud. However,
    the right balance between cloud and edge/fog computing is required (Badidi, 2020)
    based on available resources and whether or not the task is sensitive. Taneja
    et al. used a strategy Edge-Fog-Cloud to develop a detection system of lameness
    for cattle. The data from the pedometer is transmitted to the Fog node by means
    of a Long-Range proprietary protocol at 433 MHz on a distance of 2 km. Fog node
    stores in local database, preprocess and aggregates them. Fog node communicates
    with IBM Watson IoT Platform with MQTT protocol. Arriving data are picked up and
    stored in Cloudant NoSQL JSON database in IBM cloud. A mobile application synchronizes
    data with PouchDB, its local database via the REST API of Cloudant database when
    an Internet connection is available (Taneja et al., 2020). Alonso et al. presented
    Global Edge Computing Architecture (GECA), a modular tiered architecture (IoT
    Layer, Edge Layer, Business Solution Layer) to monitor dairy and feed grain state
    in real-time. In this architecture, a Distributed Ledger Technologies provides
    security from IoT Layer to Business Solution Layer. In the IoT layer, a set of
    agents call oracles to verify incoming data and afterward calculate hash of data
    with SHA-256 which is stored in the blockchain to verify the non-alteration of
    data. In parallel data is encrypted with the RSA algorithm and then sent to the
    Edge layer. The Edge Layer is responsible of the preprocessing of data and filters
    out data transmitted to the cloud. It enables also various data analyses. In the
    business Solution Layer, final storage, authentication, analysis for decision
    making is achieved. It provides also a knowledge base and APIs (Alonso et al.,
    2020). Edge-Edge is a paradigm in which devices interact to collaborate, exchange,
    and process data. The deployment of the 5G network allows the interconnection
    between UAVs and UGVs/ agricultural machinery (Tang et al., 2021). This high throughput
    network will allow to developping new collaboration between UAVs/ UGVs and agricultural
    machinery, for example, a drone will provide information to a harvester to avoid
    a non-desirable area of the field or avoid obstacles. A fleet of drones can also
    collaborate to coordinate their operations on the field between them of course
    subject to availability in rural areas, a transmission network with sufficient
    bandwidth and short-latency or capabilities to communicate between them in direct
    connection or in a mesh network. (Tang et al., 2021). Four cooperation strategies
    have been identified, two of which use the cloud, namely Fog-Cloud and Edge-Cloud.
    The other two remaing, do not involve the cloud; namely, Fog-Edge, and Edge-Edge
    cloud. The first two strategies complement the cloud to help us to address issues
    relating to production data and trade secrets, network congestion, and response
    times. The other two strategies do without the cloud and therefore assume that
    the devices/ vehicles have sufficient capacity to perform the processing. Despite
    these cooperation strategies between different levels of processing, some questions
    remain unanswered: How to store all the raw data when the data is so important
    that it would take colossal means to process it? What about security? How to organize
    the distribution of tasks between the edge, the fog, and the cloud? How to ensure
    operation and/ or treatment when network connections are intermittent or faulty?
    How to improve the maintainability of these architectures? These are the questions
    that the new trends that we describe in the next paragraph attempt to answer.
    5. New trends In this section, we present two emerging architectures not based
    on the batch or/and real-time architectures or their derivatives. Afterward, we
    describe Osmotic and Dew computing as two new paradigms, which allow us to respectively
    choose where the processing must be achieved and improve the user experience.
    New trends are additional elements that allow enriching the analysis of Section
    4 in order to address the third research question. The Microservices Architecture
    (MA) is a new system software design pattern that divides complex monolithic application
    in micro services dedicated for a single function. Microservice addresses defects
    of monolithic applications in which improving of service performance needs multiple
    deployment; a change in a function can affect all the monolith due to high dependencies
    between components; all the monolith uses a sole technology stack and development
    standards which limits possibilities to solve problems of physical heterogeneity.
    The advantages of this architecture are using a lightweight communication mechanism
    to interact between services with a minimal overload (Sun et al., 2017). The design
    proposed by (Sun et al., 2017) is composed of 8 microservices (Geo, Security,
    Tenant, Devices, Big Data, Automation, AI, and Application) and a core service
    coordinating. These services provide respectively: (1) Geo, a GIS layer to render
    data; (2) Security, user/group/role management, access control, administration,
    and authentication mechanism; (3) support for multiple IoT applications with a
    single core; (4) device plugins and communication protocols for sensing and actuating;
    (5) scalable persistence to store data; (6) process, analyze events and notify
    appropriate participant; (7) Artificial intelligence tools for IoT big data; (8)
    components to interact with client interfaces; (9) support for data exchanging
    by message with the devices. Authors argue that their approach is more flexible,
    scalable and platform-independent. Fig. 6 Table 13. Download : Download high-res

    General Scheme. Table 13. Pros and Cons of Microservices Architecture. Pros Cons
    - Fractionating of monoliths facilitates the maintainability and scalability of
    low coupled microservices. - Need to find microservice adapted with needs. - The
    discovery of micro-services allows the development new applications more easily
    than with monoliths. Fraction complex monolith is not easy. - More resilient,
    when a microservice is down, all others continue to function. Bixio et al. proposed
    a stream processing architecture event-driven based on proxy, adapter, and data
    processing microservices. This architecture extends the IoT platform Senseioty
    and using the Java OSGi framework (Bixio et al., 2020). The Data Lake Architecture
    (DLA) (Fang, 2015, Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016) enables the storage of large
    volumes of data of all types: raw data in its native format, structured, semi-structured,
    in a cost-effective manner. In this architecture, data is stored in its native
    format until it needs to process them by engines (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016),
    which allows a fast transformation and refinement of stored data regardless of
    the amount of data stored. The architecture makes it possible to consume all types
    of data (logs, web services, database, files, etc.); different ingestion systems
    consume the data and then stored it in data repository. Once the data is stored,
    query systems can query the data lake. This architecture is considered in the
    corporate world as an evolution of existing architectures. The advantage of the
    Data Lake architecture is that it can easily and inexpensively store large amounts
    of data. It is particularly well suited to storing data in a typical format. In
    Enterprise Data Lakes are used; in addition to, data warehouses. Data lakes are,
    however, unsuitable for assessing data quality, data can be placed in data lakes
    without content control, and performance is also poorer than on specially designed
    and optimized infrastructures. The Lakehouse is a variant of the Data Lake where
    storages of data are generally achieved with Hadoop in the data lake is replaced
    by a distributed storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage,
    and analysis are directly achieved by infrastructure managed by Cloud Service
    Providers such as Amazon Athena, EMR, or Databricks, Google Data proc, Azure HDInsight.

    Data lake and Lakehouse General Scheme. It crucial in agriculture to explore datasets
    from different sources. The data lake is indicated to manage the complexity of
    agricultural ecosystems and centralized all data sources to find new correlations.
    (Madera et al., 2017). A data lake provides views based on metadata. It is nevertheless
    necessary to have advanced analysis tools for predictive modeling and statistical
    analysis. López et al. used a data lake to achieve the fusion of data from different
    domains in smart the agriculture context (López et al., 2020). Gallinucci et al.
    (Gallinucci et al., 2019, Gallinucci et al., 2020) present an innovative architecture
    3 tiers architecture, called Mo.Re.Farming (MOnitoring and REmote system for a
    more sustainable FARMING) based on a data lake using Apache Hadoop and storing
    structured, semi-structured, and unstructured raw data, and in which subsequent
    processing and enrichment activities are separated. An Operational Data Store
    (ODS) using PostgreSQL with PostGIS to stores structured and detailed data and
    address limitations of big data solutions in properly handling continuous field
    geographic data. Finally, a spatial cube enables Spatial OnLine Analytical Processing
    (SOLAP). Neves et al. described an architecture in which raw data is stored in
    a datalake. Then, ETLs transforms data to be storable in a database. The data
    is enriched thanks to a knowledge base and its exploration by data mining algorithms
    (machine learning). The result of processing is filtered to improve the quality
    of structured data (Neves and Cruvinel, 2020). Table 14. Table 14. Pros and Cons
    of Datalake/DataHouse. Pros Cons - Store the data in its raw form without transforming
    them immediately. - Availability of results depend of the ingesting speed by processing
    services. - Allow store massive low-value data without investing energy to transform
    and store them in a database. - Data analysis by sampling does not give exact
    results but is estimated. - Provides a solution to situations where the volume
    of data is so large that it can no longer be processed immediately - Data House
    may be limited by the services offered by cloud providers for data analysis. Osmotic
    Computing (OC) (Villari et al., 2016) is a new paradigm inspired by the chemical
    osmosis process that corresponds to a dynamic and bidirectional flow of microservices
    between cloud and edge. OC exploits container-based solution to allows an automatic
    deployment of portable, mobile, and cross-platform microservices between Edge
    and cloud levels (Villari et al., 2016). Osmotic computing introduces the concept
    of Micro Elements (MELS) which decouples user data and applications in Micro Services
    (MS) i.e. a docker container and Micro Data (MD) i.e. an entity self-explicative
    in JSON. MS associates one operating system (Micro Operation Service) with an
    application (Micro User Service) while MD associates a microservice configuration
    (Micro Operational Data) and User data (Micro User Data). These MELS can be deployed
    on Microcontrollers (MCU) or Multiprocessor (MPU) (Villari et al., 2017). Table
    15. Table 15. Pros and Cons of Osmotic Computing. Pros Cons - Micro Element (microservice  +
    micro dataset) easy to migrate between fog and cloud. - All datasets are not decomposable
    in micro dataset. The bidirectional migration of microservices between Edge and
    Cloud must, on one hand, avoid application breakdown and QoS degradation and on
    the other hand manage them dynamically, in high heterogeneously physical resources
    context, in the function of infrastructure and applications requirements (Villari
    et al., 2016). Carnevale et al. have applied osmotic computing to the Internet
    of Things by means of a distributed multi-agent system. Each agent is self-orchestrated,
    works independently, and manages the workflow as a composition of MELs. It monitors
    the overloading state of microservices by means of response time metric and decides
    to relocate them to another agent based on a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
    or Time Series Analysis (Carnevale et al., 2019). Fig. 8, Fig. 9. Download : Download

    image Fig. 9. Osmotic Computing General Scheme. In an IoT context, OC allows to
    deploy lightweight micro services at edge level while complex micro services are
    deployed at fog/cloud level, and balance load between edge, fog, and cloud. (Maksimović,
    2018). Morshed et al. proposed to use OC to distribute Deep Learning across edge,
    cloud, and mobile edge in a holistic way (Morshed et al., 2017). However, Kaur
    et al. in their Osmotic Computing applications survey have identified the need
    of standardization in terms of infrastructure deployment and micro-services distribution.
    The orchestration is crucial to manage efficient services. Security remains an
    important challenge because the service migration is supported by different layers
    (Kaur et al., 2020). Dew Computing (DC) (Skala et al., 2015) allows to further
    improve response times by pushing from Central cloud to end-users, computing applications,
    data, and low-level services. Client microcomputers are used to store a part of
    the data locally in the background and to limit access to the cloud, reduce network
    dependency and drastically reduce processing cost (Skala et al., 2015). Dew computing
    is the additional piece of cloud computing. It is mainly composed of a wide range
    of heterogeneous devices and varied equipment ranging from smartphones to smart
    sensors (Wang, 2016). DC is highly and effectively capable in terms of scalability
    and ability to perform sophisticated operations and to process numerous applications
    and tools. Additionally, the equipment of DC is ad hoc programmable and self-adaptive.
    They have the qualifications to running the process within another process in
    a distributed way without a focal communication network (Skala et al., 2015).
    Applications running in the on-premises computers provide services to users and/or
    devices independently of the cloud but collaborating with cloud services (Wang,
    2016). DC can provide access web fraction without Internet connection (WiD), Storage
    in dew has a cloud copy (STiD), Local database has a cloud backup (DBiD), Software
    ownership and settings have a cloud copy (SiD), SDK and projects have a cloud
    copy (PiD), On-premises computer settings and data have a cloud copy (IaD), Other
    services (DiD) (Wang, 2016). The Fig. 10 presents the dew computing in the general
    scheme Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing. Table 16. Download : Download high-res image

    Table 16. Pros and Cons of Dew Computing. Pros Cons - Allows access to a local
    copy of data when the connection is unavailable. - Replication of data is bandwidth-consuming.
    - Improve the reliability and the false tolerance. - Difficult to exploit if bandwidth
    is insufficient. Rajakaruna et al. presented a dew architecture based on a drone
    to retrieve and process data, manage WSN, and play the role of dew server. The
    drone communicates with sensors, and actuators with BLE protocol, collect, store
    data, and then when the drone is at the docking station it sends data to the cloud
    (Rajakaruna et al., 2018). Grovers et al. described a reliable and fault-tolerant
    architecture at 4 levels (edge, dew, fog, and cloud) in which sensed data is replicated
    at edge, fog and cloud level in order to take over the application’s control when
    a server is failed. In their architecture, dew servers are closed and linked with
    sensors producing data. The fault tolerance is ensured by mobile agents working
    as a resource exchanging the application and link-state information between us,
    and the network monitoring agent (Grover and Garimella, 2018). The Blockchain
    is a distributed digital ledger of transaction distributed maintained by a network
    of multiple computing nodes. This ledger can be deployed among the IoT nodes network
    (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). In the blockchain, transactions namely blocks are
    managed by a specific software platform ensuring the data transmission, processing
    and storage, and its representation in a human-readable form allowing a consistent
    view and a consensus between the participants (Kamilaris et al., 2019). Different
    mechanisms of consensus whose two main ones are the “Proof of Work (PoW)” and
    the Proof of Stake (PoS). The PoW requires the solving of difficult computational
    tasks before validating transactions and the adding of the block in the blockchain.
    In this approach “miners” are in competition to be the first and obtain the rewards,
    which has an impact on the environment, need expending large a amount of computer
    and energy, and involves a risk of centralization. While the PoS approach, “validators”
    are randomly selected with a probability which depends on the amount of stake
    held. At the end of the validation process, it earns a fee. Other less used consensus
    mechanisms exist such as (1) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) in which each node generates
    a random wait time and goes to sleep for that specified duration; (2) Simplified
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), an improvement of Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance (PBFT) specifically designed for blockchain in which each new block
    is maintained by a delegation of nodes with increasing authority. Each one uses
    the internal time to decide when actions must be done; (3) Proof of Authority
    (PoA) in which approved accounts process to the automated validation of transaction
    and blocks. Table 17. Table 17. Pros and Cons of Blockchain. Pros Cons - Data
    distributed (Alonso et al., 2020). - Energy consumption for the complex signature
    verification process can be important. - Immutable, durable, verifiable, secure,
    and transparent (Alonso et al., 2020). - Not adapted to store images, video. -

    Fig. 11. Blockchain General Scheme. The block chain is mainly used in Agriculture
    to make the data of the supply chain transparent and open (Bermeo-Almeida et al.,
    2018) and ensure the complete traceability of the food chain from the fork to
    the plate. The block chain allows to record information about: (1) Transactions
    between provider and farmer as well as information relating to the crops, material
    and chemical products; (2) The farm, cultivation practices and management, animals
    feeding, and complementary information such as weather conditions, animals welfare,
    diseases, treatment, etc; (3) Information about factory and its equipment, the
    processing method, batch numbers but also financial transactions with producers
    and distributors; (4) Warehousing, storage conditions (temperature, humidity),
    methods of transport, transit time, and all financial transactions between the
    distributors and retailers; (5) food items information such as quantity available,
    quality, expiration date, time spent on the shelf or in the stock (Bermeo-Almeida
    et al., 2018, Kamilaris et al., 2019). The Fig. 12 shows an example of blockchain
    applied to an agri supply chain. Download : Download high-res image (112KB) Download

    extent, secured data storage, remote monitoring, and automation. The blockchain
    address some challenges of IoT such as decentralization, data anonymization, and
    security. Moreover, it allows faster and efficient operations, to improve reliability
    and scalability (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). The analysis of new trends shows
    that: (1) Micro service architecture allows decomposing monoliths in microservices
    lowly coupled which makes it easier to maintain it while allowing other services
    to continue operating. Furthermore, this type of architecture is more resilient
    because if one of the services is down, the other services due to the weak coupling
    can continue to operate at least in a degraded mode. (2) Data Lake/DataHouse propose
    a new approach Load Transform Extract (LTE) where data are firstly stored in their
    original format, which are then transformed in order to extract information. This
    paradigm is particularly well adapted when the amount of data is so important
    that process all data is too costly. In this case, data can be sampled in order
    to obtain information. This paradigm is also well adapted if we want to conserve
    also raw data or complete a generic architecture, for example, to store data that
    will be processed in batch processing. (3) Osmotic Computing attempts to propose
    a solution to the repartition of workload between fog and cloud in decomposing
    treatments in microelements composed of a microservice associated with a micro
    dataset. The osmotic computing could also be associated with the micro service
    architecture to allow the distribution of instances of microservices at different
    levels of the network according to their respective load. (4) Dew Computing aims
    to replicate data near sensors or users to continue to store data or allows to
    continue to consult data when connection is intermittent. It allows improving
    the reliance of architectures on connection interruptions. (5) Blockchain provides
    an answer to authentication and security problems by making it possible in particular
    to verify that the data has not been altered or compromised. Nevertheless, it
    is not possible to store large amount of data such as high definitions images,
    or videos in the blockchain but hashes of datasets allowing to verify their authenticity
    well. 6. Towards Agriculture 5.0 According Myklevy et al., the world must improve
    the amount of food produced by 70% by 2050 to produce global food needs for a
    population (Mykleby et al., 2016) of 9.7 billion according to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Zhang, 2016). To overcome these problems
    and contribute to achieve the second objective of 17 Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) with a timeframe in the range 2015 to 2030,
    the concept of Agriculture 5.0 has been born (Martos et al., 2021). Agriculture
    5.0 aims to increase production sustainably while consuming fewer resources and
    taking care of the environment. This next wave of agricultural revolution will
    imply the use of robots integrating machine learning to compensate for the shortage
    of workers. Farm robots are drastically increasing productivity in improving the
    human labor workforce and can also harvest a more important volume faster than
    a human. Nevertheless, these early technologies are still too expensive for most
    farmers especially small farms (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más, 2020). Fig. 13 show
    the coupling between Agriculture 4.0 and Agriculture 5.0 and their integration
    in the context of the agri-food supply chain, the Society 5.0 and 17 Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations (See Fig. 13). Download : Download

    of the Agriculture 5.0 in the context of the Society 5.0. 7. Conclusion Our review
    is boosted by four research questions dectitaed as follow: (1) Which storage and
    processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address
    its particularities? (2) Can generic architectures meet the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that
    allow the transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical
    valuation possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded
    or autonomous products?. The analysis of the literature shows that a multitude
    of architecture coexists. Nevertheless, the Lambada and Kappa architectures seem
    to emerge as generic architectures. These must generally be accompanied by complementary
    architectural components to address specific needs and be part of a storage and
    processing strategy in which the cloud architecture is a component of the chain
    or may also and more rarely be absent. The traditional centralized cloud computing
    will continue to remain an important part of computing systems (Ai et al., 2018),
    for sciences even if other paradigms appear. Indeed, cloud, fog, and edge computing
    complementary interact with each other to form a mutually beneficial and interdependent
    service continuum. Some functions are naturally more suitable or advantageous
    at a level than another in function of requirements in response time, computing,
    or latency tolerance. However, the cloud cannot be completely replaced by fog
    and edge computing because some computation-intensive tasks can only be processed
    at the cloud level, which has the computing power and storage capacities (Wang
    et al., 2020). In Agriculture 4.0, this is particularly the case for the processing
    of satellite images, the training of artificial intelligence algorithms such as
    Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). New trends make it possible to address
    various problems: (1) The Data lake/Data House offers a more economical alternative
    to massive cloud storage in databases. In this paradigm, all data are stored in
    a state and transform only when they are to be exploited. This approach is particularly
    interesting on one hand when all data are not exploited and on the other hand
    when a decision or an action is not expected immediately. Data lake also allows
    the fusion of agriculture data from various origins in different formats and granularity.
    (2) The blockchain provides solutions in particular to the security problems,
    the possibility of distributing data storage and ensuring the traceability of
    transactions in agrifood supply chains (3) As the literature has shown, Dew Computing
    can be placed in two different places in the network either as close as possible
    to the sensors to allow processing to continue during transmission interruptions
    or as close as possible to users in order to have a local copy of the data in
    order to be able to consult them offline. It should be noted, however, that for
    the second option, there are other means of local caching at the device level,
    for amounts of data of a few mega as those offered by Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
    by example. (4) Osmotic computing provides a solution to the question of how to
    distribute the load between the different processing levels (edge, fog, cloud).
    It uses the concept of microelement associating a microservice and its micro dataset.
    In addition, osmotic computing can also be associated with micro-service architectures.
    (5) The microservice architecture offers the possibility of decoupling the monolithic
    architectures into weakly coupled microservices. These services can be more easily
    associated, maintained, or evolved independently. The combination of these microservices
    makes it easier to develop new services for the end-user that are also easier
    and faster to evolve according to technological developments and needs. In addition,
    at the network level, the 5G network offers new possibilities in terms of Wireless
    Sensors and Actuators Network (WSAN), communication between machines, UAVs, and
    UGVs. Moreover, the coupling with MEC opens the field of processing close of end-users.
    The SDN/NFV Architecture allows to facilitate the design, and to improve the flexibility
    of network. Software-defined networking (SDN) allows decoupling transmission of
    data and network control functionality while Network function virtualization (NFV)
    abstracts transfer network and related network functions (Friha et al., 2021).
    Two trends in the use of processing architecture coexist, on the one hand, users
    of a paid or open source IoT platform, and on the other hand, users who develop
    specific architectures to implement particular use cases. From the point of view
    of transferability, we understand that it is easier for ready-made chargeable
    infrastructures and that it can be limited for turnkey open-source infrastructures
    where the type of license adopted may pose a problem. However, the sustainability
    of paid infrastructure is conditional on the development granted by the company
    that manages them and on its financial health. The development of architecture
    based on paid software bricks is facilitated but its durability is conditioned
    by the availability and the maintenance of these software bricks. As for transferability,
    it is linked to the acquisition of ad hoc licenses. The development of architecture
    using open source software bricks from foundations such as Apache Foundation makes
    it possible not to be limited by licenses but is dependent on developments and
    maintenance carried out by the community of developers. These software bricks
    can be abandoned by the community, the company that sponsors them, or the foundation
    that hosts them. The development of a sustainable architecture would go through
    an emancipation of software bricks which would make it possible to easily change
    them on the one hand when one of them disappears or if a new more efficient software
    brick appears. The deployment of 5G and satellite Internet will bring in a new
    player, which are the telecommunications companies that will be able to provide
    processing capacities and services as close as possible to users at the level
    of 5G antennas, which will impact processing architectures. The problem will then
    arise of interoperability between the networks of sensors and actuators with these
    new high-speed, low-latency networks. The new networks offered by the telecommunications
    companies will make it possible to offer new services or even to decouple the
    software from the hardware, which will make it possible to make the sensors and
    actuators interchangeable. This should make it possible to reduce the cost of
    the equipment and make it accessible to developing countries or areas not covered
    by traditional LPWAN and 3GPP networks. The impact of these new networks will
    have to be reviewed in the future to identify the new trends offered by 5G and
    satellite Internet. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

  title: 'Cloud and distributed architectures for data management in agriculture 4.0
    : Review and future trends'
  verbatim_quote1: Lambda architecture is used in systems that need to process and
    expose quickly massive amounts of streaming data. This cloud architecture was
    proposed by Nathan Marz and James Warren (Marz and Warren, 2013) to handle tremendous
    quantities of data and resolve complex problems combining processing large volumes
    of data (Batch) while incorporating the most recent data processed in real-time
    processes (Singh et al., 2019). This architecture is generic, scalable, and fault-tolerant
    against hardware failures and human mistakes.
  verbatim_quote2: Kappa architecture, proposed by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps,
    2014), simplifies the Lambda architecture by combining real-time and batch layers.
    This cloud architecture differs from the Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent
    storage system of data in an unchangeable log file such as system as Apache Spark
    or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow only storage for a limited time in order
    to allow an eventual reprocessing of these data.

    \ that has become a part of \nmodern society and is generating tremendous \nenthusiasm\
    \ among both the business and academic \ncommunities. IoT, as the next-generation\
    \ technology, \nhas enormous ramifications for many industries [1]. \nAccording\
    \ to analyst predictions, the IoT could reach \n64 billion devices by 2025, constituting\
    \ one of the \nmajor sources of \"Big Data,\" distinguished by \nvolume, value,\
    \ variety, velocity, and accuracy [24]. \nThe IoT is primarily concerned with\

    \ [6, 7]:  \n IoT is a technological advancement that enables \nobjects to be\
    \ connected to the internet via wired or \nwireless networks so that they can\

    \ Zigbee, radio frequency \nidentification (RFID), Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. \n The\
    \ sensors can be connected to various \ntechnologies, \nincluding \nlong-term\

    \ of mobile telephony (3G), and global \nsystem for mobile communication (GSM).\
    \  \nReview Article \nAbstract  \nThe internet of things (IoT) has been a major\
    \ buzzword in recent years, with the potential to connect a huge number of \n\
    devices to the internet and each other. The integration of all of these devices\
    \ and data sources into a cohesive system is \none of the key challenges involved\
    \ in the development of the IoT. Cloud integration is one approach that can be\
    \ used to \nachieve this, and there are several different cloud-based IoT platforms\
    \ available. As consequences, IoT and cloud \ncomputing has drastically changed\
    \ the environment of technological development. A synergistic strategy that combines\
    \ \nthe strengths of these two breakthrough technologies into one package is estimated\
    \ to provide enormous benefits. Despite \nthese advantages, the integration of\
    \ such technologies poses numerous issues and challenges. An in-depth analysis\
    \ of \neach of these technologies is discussed, along with the advantages, challenges,\
    \ and limitations associated with convergent \napproach. The preferred reporting\
    \ items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method has been used\
    \ to \nidentify all relevant articles from the literature, and the most relevant\
    \ articles have been included for further analysis. \nThe relevant articles have\
    \ been analysed using the method of the Bibliometric network, such as co-authorship\
    \ analysis, \nterm co-occurrence. Furthermore, taxonomy of IoT-based cloud applications\
    \ has been discussed and quality of service \n(QoS) factors-based analysis for\
    \ each applications domain has been done. In this review, we take a look at some\
    \ of the \nmost popular IoT cloud integration platforms and compare their features\
    \ and capabilities. In addition, we have \ninvestigated a variety of related technologies\
    \ and anticipated future developments. \n \nKeywords \nInternet of things (IoT),\

    \ \nwhich is crucial to its operation. \no Perception  \no Middle-ware (Edge,\
    \ Fog, and Cloud)  \no Application \n \nNevertheless, cloud technology offers\
    \ virtually \nunlimited storage and system capabilities to address a \nwide range\
    \ of challenges related to IoT. In \nconsequence, the phrase \"cloud of things\"\
    \ (CoT) is \nused to allude the fusion of IoT and cloud computing. \nThe \"CoT\"\
    \ is a paradigm for increasing productivity \nand improving system performance\
    \ that is widely \nused by most industries and manufacturers [8]. \nSeveral researchers\
    \ discussed in their research [9] \nregarding the use of cloud as a platform to\
    \ analyze \nBig Data when data storage and processing are \nrequired. A recent\
    \ empirical study [10] identified \nmany challenges for energy efficient technology\
    \ that \nwill need to be addressed in the future. \n \nWith the advent of the\
    \ IoT, gigantic amounts of data \nare generated in real-time, and this poses a\
    \ major \nconcern for traditional cloud computing network \ntopologies [11]. A\
    \ traditional cloud infrastructure \ncondenses all processing, storage, and networking\
    \ \ninto a limited set of data centers, and the distance \nbetween remote devices\
    \ and remote data centers is \nrelatively wide [12]. This challenge could be \n\
    addressed by edge computing since it provides access \nto computing resources\
    \ that are closer to IoT edge \ndevices and may lead to a new ecosystem for IoT\
    \ \ninnovation [13]. \n \n1.1Background \nA brief introduction to some of the\
    \ most important \naspects and terminology used throughout this study is \nprovided\
    \ in this section. This section is intended to \nhelp the reader understand and\
    \ better comprehend the \ninformation that is presented in each section of the\
    \ \npaper.   \n1.1.1Internet of things (IoT) \nKevin Ashton, a British technology\
    \ pioneer, formed \nthe phrase \"IoT\" in 1999 to represent a system in \nwhich\
    \ physical artifacts are connected to the internet \nusing sensors. A \"thing\"\
    \ can refer to any physical \nentity on the surface of the earth, whether it is\
    \ a \ncommunication device or not. Despite the widespread \nacceptance of the\
    \ IoT concept, no standard definition \nhas been adopted. There are several definitions\
    \ in \nexistence: \"The IoT refers to the prospect of devices \nthat can create,\
    \ exchange, and utilize data without the \nuse of a central computing device,\
    \ where the \nconnectivity of networks and computing capability \ncan be applied\
    \ to objects, sensors, and everyday \nobjects, not to personal computers. \n \n\
    It is stated in the Oxford Dictionary [14]. ―An \nInternet-based architecture\
    \ provides connectivity \nbetween electronic devices embedded in real-world \n\
    objects, enabling them to exchange information‖. \nAccording to the RFID group,\
    \ ―It is a global network \nof \ninterconnected \nobjects \nwith \nstandardized\
    \ \ncommunication protocols that allow them to be \naccessed by a single entity.‖\
    \ \n \nThree-layered architecture of IoT \nIoT architecture comprises mainly three\
    \ layers [15, \n16], namely ―perception layer‖, ―middleware layer‖, \nand ―application\
    \ layer‖, as demonstrated in Figure 1. \nThe middle layer of this architecture\
    \ exists on the \nedge, fog, and cloud computing [1720]. \nPerception layer \n\
    Perception layer senses data from the surrounding via \nactuators and sensors.\
    \ It identifies, gathers, and \nprocesses data and sends it to the network layer.\
    \ It \ndetects other physical parameter in the physical \nenvironment or recognize\
    \ intelligent objects. It also \ncollaborates on local and small-scale networks\
    \ with \nthe IoT node. \nMiddleware \nAs the 'processing layer', the middleware\
    \ is \nresponsible for the analysis, processing, and storage \nof a large amount\
    \ of data obtained from the \nperception layer. It can perform a variety of tasks\
    \ and \nproviding services to the lower layer. Various \ntechnologies \nare \n\
    employed, \nincluding \nhigh-\nperformance computing tools, cloud computing, and\
    \ \ndatabase management systems. Additionally, it \nintroduces a level of abstraction\
    \ for developers as \nwell as users. \nApplication layer \nIt is the responsibility\
    \ of this layer to provide \nspecialized application services to the client. As\
    \ a \nresult, it includes a variety of applications, including \nair quality monitoring,\
    \ smart buildings, precision \nfarming, intelligent cities, and innovative health\
    \ care, \nas well as data integrity, authenticity, and security. \nThis layer\
    \ is intended to enable designing an \nintelligent environment. \n \n \nManzoor\

    1.1.2Cloud computing  \nDuring the last few decades, cloud computing has \ntaken\
    \ on several definitions. As per National Institute \nof Standards and Technology\
    \ (NIST): \"Cloud \ncomputing is a service delivery model that facilitates \n\
    easy, on-demand access to a shared pool of flexible \ncomputing resources that\
    \ can be accessed and \ndelivered on time with a minimum of effort or \nmanagement\"\
    \ [21]. As utility-based computing \nprogresses, it is anticipated that it will\
    \ move to cloud \ncomputing, which has the potential to be a more \nintelligent\
    \ in-service provisioning process. Another \nkey advantage of cloud computing\
    \ is that it reduces \ninformation \ntechnology \n(IT's) \ndependence \non \n\
    fundamental \ninfrastructure \nsettings \n[22]. \nThe \nimplementation \nand \n\
    execution \nof \nscientific \nworkflows involving Big Data requires a synergistic\
    \ \nmodel, according to recent studies [23]. Cloud \ncomputing has suggested the\
    \ following functionality: \nmeasured services, rapid elasticity, scalability,\
    \ multi-\ntenancy, resource pooling, extensive network access \nwith \non-demand\
    \ \nservice \n[2426]. The \ncloud \ncomputing characteristics are shown in Figure\
    \ 2. \n \n \nFigure 2 Cloud computing characteristics \n \nOn-demand self-service\
    \  \nNumerous cloud-based services may be delivered \nwithout involving human\
    \ involvement on the part of \nthe service provider. Most of these services comprise\
    \ \nstorage capacity, database instances, and virtual \nmachine instances. Accessing\
    \ cloud accounts and \nmonitoring services can be done using a self-service \n\
    web interface provided by production organisations. \nAn end-user can provide\
    \ computing resources \nindependently, such as database setting and shared \n\

    \ 9(97)                                 \n1815          \n \nstorage when required,\
    \ without any interference from \nthe IT manager of the provider. \n \nExtensive\
    \ network access  \nCloud services may be accessed by a variety of user \napplications\
    \ on the network. A local area network \n(LAN) or the internet in the setting\
    \ of a private cloud \nare both viable choices, even though the enterprise \n\
    prefers robust, wide-bandwidth networks. The quality \nof service (QoS) of cloud\
    \ computing is heavily \ndependent on network capacity and latency. It has \n\
    been conventional to use a variety of network-\naccessible technologies to make\
    \ thin and dense \nheterogeneous business solutions more accessible \n(such as\
    \ smartphones, laptops, workstations, and \npersonal computers). \n \nMulti-tenancy\
    \ and resource pooling  \nMulti-tenant environments can be accommodated by \n\
    cloud \ncomputing \nresources. \nWith \nnumerous \ntenancies, a single software\
    \ or physical infrastructure \ncan be used by a variety of clients, all while\
    \ ensuring \nthe privacy and confidentiality of their data. In \nmultitenant systems,\
    \ different services, for instance \nmemory, processing capability, storage space,\
    \ and \nnetwork resources, are allocated to several users in \naccordance with\
    \ their individual needs (virtual \nresources are assigned or moved dynamically\
    \ in \nresponse to the requirements of each user). The word \n\"resource pooling\"\
    \ refers to the sharing of physical \nassets among multiple clients. \n \nThe\
    \ provider's resource pool should be sufficiently \nlarge and diverse to serve\
    \ a variety of consumer \nneeds while maintaining economic spectrum. As a \nresult\
    \ of resource pooling, the performance of \nmission-critical industrial applications\
    \ should not be \nadversely affected. Scheduling resources is a critical \npart\
    \ of cloud computing. According to the study [27], \nthe present state of task\
    \ scheduling methodologies is \nbased on a host of different scheduling parameters.\
    \ \nRapid elasticity and scalability  \nIt is feasible to scale cloud computing\
    \ services to \nmeet the demands of a business. It is an essential \naspect of\
    \ cloud computing. There are no penalties \nassociated with customizing costs,\
    \ efficiency, or \navailability. It enables manufacturing companies to \nrapidly\
    \ produce and deliver any cloud computing \nresource. This functionality can be\
    \ utilised for \nstorage, \nvirtualization \nsoftware, \nor \nmarketing \nassistance.\
    \ Scalability is more liberal and pragmatic. \nScalability dynamically adds or\
    \ removes resources to \nmeet changing application requirements within the \n\
    network's constraints. \nMeasured service \nCloud computing applications are quantified,\
    \ and \nproducing businesses pay for what they use. The \nauthors of the study\
    \ [28] emphasised the challenges \nencountered by researchers working in bioinformatics\
    \ \nin terms of planning their research efficiently and \neffectively utilising\
    \ cloud computing. In cloud \ntechnologies, resource consumption is effectively\
    \ \nmanaged and optimized automatically by utilizing \nmeasurements at many levels\
    \ of abstraction, such as \nnetwork bandwidth, computing power, storage, and \n\
    the number of active users. Both the supplier and the \nconsumer's resource requirements\
    \ may be monitored, \nquantified, and communicated openly. \n1.1.3Edge computing\
    \ technology \nEdge computing is a data networking paradigm that \nstresses \n\
    minimising \nlatency \nand \nbandwidth \nconsumption by processing as near to\
    \ the data source \nas feasible [29]. According to [30], \"Edge computing \nis\
    \ a distributed computing paradigm that brings \ncomputation and data storage\
    \ closer to the location \nwhere it is needed, to improve response times and \n\
    save bandwidth.\" \n \nRole of edge computing in IoT technology \nIn IoT technology,\
    \ edge computing transforms the \ndata that is managed, processed, and distributed\
    \ by \nmillions of IoT devices [31]. With the explosive \ngrowth of internet-enabled\
    \ technologies, the IoT and \nemerging technologies requiring real-time cloud\
    \ \nservices tend to support sophisticated computing \nsystems, the IoT and emerging\
    \ technologies requiring \nreal-time cloud services tend to support sophisticated\
    \ \ncomputing systems [32]. With edge computing, data \nis evaluated on the edge\
    \ of the local network before \nreaching the fog and the cloud for rapid, reliable,\
    \ \nconnectivity-independent, and scalable IoT Edge \nprocessing. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the IoT, edge, fog, and \ncloud computing architecture. \n1.1.4Fusion of IoT\
    \ and cloud technology \nThe IoT consists of a network of physical objects that\
    \ \nare connected to the internet and are equipped with \nthe ability to collect,\
    \ exchange, and use data. In cloud \ncomputing, resources are delivered over the\
    \ internet \nas a service. With the integration of IoT and cloud \ncomputing,\
    \ new applications have been developed \nthat have the potential to revolutionize\
    \ the way we \nlive and work. In addition, the integration of the IoT \ninto the\
    \ cloud is a natural evolution of the \ntechnology. The cloud provides the perfect\
    \ platform \nfor storing and analyzing the vast amounts of data \nproduced by\
    \ IoT devices. In addition, it provides \nreal-time data processing and analytics,\
    \ which is \nessential \nfor \napplications \nsuch \nas \npredictive \nManzoor\
    \ Ansari et al. \n1816 \n \nmaintenance and energy management. In the last \n\
    decade, the IoT and cloud-based services have \nevolved \nand \nmatured \nindependently\
    \ \non \nboth \ncontinents. Due to their unique characteristics, these \ntechnologies\
    \ are attractive to researchers and have \nmultiple applications. The integrated\
    \ paradigm does \nnot have a well-known term in the scientific \ncommunity. In\
    \ the literature, other general terms have \nbeen discovered, including fusion\
    \ of internet of \neverything and cloud (Cloud of Everything), IoT \nCloud, CoT\
    \ and web of things (WoT) [33]. \n \n \nFigure 3 IoT, Edge, Fog, and cloud architecture\
    \ \n \nA key component of the IoT is its capacity to utilize \nvirtually unlimited\
    \ amounts of cloud computing \nresources and capacity (such as computation \n\
    capabilities, \nstorage \ncapabilities, \nand \nenergy \nefficiency) \nto \nhelp\
    \ \novercome \ntechnological \nlimitations. A cloud-based computing strategy is\
    \ an \neffective tool for preserving data as well as for use in \na variety of\
    \ applications As a contrast, cloud \ncomputing could influence the IoT by introducing\
    \ \nnew applications that address distributed real-world \nproblems and by allowing\
    \ new installations that can \nbe applied to various real-world scenarios [34].\
    \ \n \nDue to its limited and vigorous capabilities, the IoT \ncontains devices\
    \ with minimal processing power and \nstorage capacity in comparison with the\
    \ numerous \ncomplex tasks that need to be completed. These \ndevices may serve\
    \ as data providers and transfer data \nfor processing and storage directly to\
    \ the cloud [35, \n36].  \n \nIn the cloud computing environment, applications\
    \ \nand objects communicate over an intermediary layer \nthat hides the functionality\
    \ and complexity required \nto implement them. This strategy will dramatically\
    \ \nimpact applications that address current challenges \nwith gathering data,\
    \ integration, and distribution in a \nmulti-cloud context. \nCurrent research\
    \ on the integration of IoT with cloud \ncomputing \nfocuses \non \nallowing \n\
    real-world \napplications including sustainable buildings, smart \ncities, connected\
    \ vehicles and industrial automation. \nThe use of IoT devices and sensors in\
    \ conjunction \nwith cloud-based analytics and decision-making \nmodels offer\
    \ the promise of significant improvements \nin efficiency, safety, and quality\
    \ of life.  \n \nThe future direction of research on IoT and cloud \ncomputing\
    \ integration will be driven by the need to \naddress challenges including data\
    \ privacy, security, \nscalability, energy efficiency, and interoperability. In\
    \ \naddition, there is a need for further research into how \nbest to exploit\
    \ the unique capabilities offered by this \ntechnology combination to create new\
    \ applications \nthat deliver real value to user. \n \nArchitecture for cloud-based\
    \ IoT \nA \ncloud-based \nIoT \narchitecture \nmust \nbe \naccomplished of supporting\
    \ a wide range of devices \nand sensors, as well as the data they acquire. It\
    \ must \nbe able to handle the data generated by the devices in \nreal-time and\
    \ provide the necessary processing and \nanalysis. The architecture must also\
    \ be able to \nsupport the security and privacy requirements of the \nIoT applications\
    \ [37, 38]. An IoT-based cloud \necosystem is composed of three layers: the physical\

    \ layer, and the application layer. \nThe bottom layer (the physical layer) is\
    \ responsible \nfor collecting the data required by the next layer, that \nis,\
    \ the network layer, from their surroundings. A \nvariety of interesting services\
    \ are accessed by the \nnetwork layer from the physical layer. Figure 4 \ndemonstrates\
    \ the cloud-based IoT infrastructure. \n \n \nFigure 4 Cloud of things architecture\
    \ \n \n1.2 Challenges of the domain \nAfter a comprehensive analysis of the included\
    \ \nliterature, we revealed a lot of emerging research \nchallenges in the field\
    \ of integration of IoT and \ncloud. However, here we are going to mention the\
    \ \nmost cited one. Since, the challenges of the IoT cloud \ndomain are mainly\
    \ related to data gathering, \ncommunication, and storage. The data collected\
    \ by \nvarious IoT devices need to be transmitted to the \ncloud for analysis\
    \ and decision-making. This requires \nefficient and reliable communication protocols\
    \ \nbetween the devices and the cloud. The data collected \nby IoT devices also\
    \ need to be stored securely in the \ncloud. Moreover, throughout this study,\
    \ we cited \nsome more such challenges in section 7. \n \n1.3 Research motivation\
    \ \nAlthough this field is still in a developmental stage, \nresearchers are working\
    \ on integrating domain, \nsecurity, and QoS to develop a more secure and \nefficient\
    \ system. Meanwhile, we investigated a large \nnumber of relevant studies on this\
    \ domain. However, \nwe could not find extensive research in the domain of \n\
    integration of IoT and cloud. Although a countable \nset of researchers working\
    \ on this domain, they have \nrevealed some unavoidable research gaps regarding\
    \ \nthis field. Therefore, more research on this field is the \npressing need\
    \ of the hour. This study explores the \ncurrent state of the art in this domain.\
    \ \nThe motivation for the review of the integration of \nIoT and cloud computing\
    \ are as follows. \n With the vast amount of data produced by IoT \ndevices,\
    \ it is becoming increasingly difficult to \nmanage and analyze this data effectively\
    \ without \nthe use of cloud computing. So, the need for better \ndata management\
    \ and analysis motivates me to \nexplore in this direction.  \n By storing data\
    \ in the cloud, it is feasible to utilise \nthe security features provided by\
    \ cloud service \nproviders. So, the need to improve security is \nanother motivation\
    \ for me to integrate these two \ntechnologies. \n Any IoT-device-reliant application\
    \ must have the \ncapacity to dynamically scale up or down as \nneeded. In this\
    \ regard, increasing scalability is one \nof the factors motivating me to pursue\
    \ this \npathbreaking technology. \n \n1.4 Research objectives \nThe IoT and cloud\
    \ computing are two new \ntechnologies that are gaining traction in a number of\
    \ \ndifferent industries. There is a growing need for \neffective integration\
    \ (IoT and cloud) of these \ntechnologies \nfor \nimproved \ndecision-making,\
    \ \nincreased \nefficiency, \nand \ndecreased \ncosts. \nNonetheless, current\
    \ research in this field is still in its \ninfancy. In this article, first, we\
    \ will discuss a \nsummary of the current literature on IoT and cloud \nintegration.\
    \ We will then identify some key \nchallenges, opportunities, and future directions\
    \ for \nresearch in this area. Three broad categories of \nresearch are currently\
    \ being conducted on IoT and \ncloud integration: (1) Development of frameworks\
    \ \nand platforms for IoT and cloud integration; (2) \nDesign and implementation\
    \ of applications using IoT \nand \ncloud \ntechnologies; \n(3) \nEvaluation \n\
    and \nManzoor Ansari et al. \n1818 \n \ncomparative analysis based on various\
    \ parameters of \nIoT and cloud systems. In terms of frameworks and \nplatforms\
    \ for IoT and cloud integration, there has \nbeen considerable work on developing\
    \ middleware \nsolutions that can enable seamless interaction \nbetween these\
    \ two technologies. Some notable \nexamples include the Eclipse Smart Home platform\
    \ \n(https://www.eclipse.org/), IBM Watson IoT platform \n(https://www.ibm.com/),\
    \ and Microsoft Azure IoT \nSuite (https://azure.microsoft.com/). \n \nThe objectives\
    \ of this research article are follows: \n To present an overview of current\
    \ research on the \nintegration of IoT and cloud computing. \n To compare and\
    \ analyze the existence literature \nassociated with IoT cloud integration.  \n\
     To \nidentify \nand \ndiscussed \nthe \nchallenges \nassociated with IoT cloud\
    \ integration.  \n To \nidentify \nand \nanalyze \nthe \nopportunities \nassociated\
    \ with IoT cloud integration in many real-\nworld applications.  \n To identify\
    \ future research directions in this area.   \n \n1.5 Research questions \nAs\
    \ this study aims to provide a survey on cloud and \nIoT integration, the following\
    \ research questions are \nframed to cover the related concepts, applications,\
    \ \nand tools/techniques. \n \nRQ1.How many research publications have been \n\
    done in the field of IoT and cloud integration spread \nover the years? \nRQ2.What\

    \ out a systematic review of the literature on \nIoT cloud integration, the following\
    \ steps need to be \nfollowed: \nStep 1. The first step in the systematic review\
    \ \nprocess is to identify the research question. The \nquestion should be specific\
    \ and answerable and \nshould focus on the effects of a particular \nintervention\
    \ or exposure.  \nStep 2. The next step is to identify relevant studies. \nStudies\
    \ can be identified through a variety of sources, \nincluding \ndatabases, \n\
    literature \nreviews, \nand \nconference proceedings. \nStep 3. The third step\
    \ is extracting data from high-\nquality and valid studies from the collection-related\
    \ \nliterature in step 2. \nStep 4. The fourth step is to analyze the data that\
    \ has \nbeen extracted. This analysis should be performed in \na systematic and\
    \ unbiased manner.  \nStep 5. The data extracted in step 4, we analyzed \neach\
    \ category of data and outcome of this step came \nto the final step 6. \nStep\
    \ 6. The final step is to write a report of the \nfindings. This report should\
    \ be clear, concise, and \nshould provide a synthesis of the evidence that was\
    \ \ngathered during the systematic review process. \n \nIn general, the structure\
    \ of this paper can be \nsummarized as follows this article begins with an \n\
    introductory section 1 which discusses some of the \nbasics of the IoT, cloud\
    \ computing, edge computing, \nand their architectures. In addition, the challenges,\
    \ \nmotivations, and objectives are described in this \nsection.  \n \nSection\
    \ 2 reviews the current state of IoT and cloud \ntechnologies. A comparative analysis\
    \ of the existing \nliterature is also provided in this section.  \n \nIn section\
    \ 3, we provide an overview of the research \nmethodology, which includes the\
    \ search query, \nselection criteria, and process flow. Moreover, \nliterature\
    \ trends, distribution of literature, and \nbibliometric analysis are described\
    \ in this section. \nWe analyze IoT and cloud technology employing \nseveral resources\
    \ following preferred reporting items \nfor systematic reviews and meta-analyses\
    \ (PRISMA) \nstandards. An overview of the systematic process \nflow adopted for\
    \ this study is presented in Figure 5. \n \nIn section 4, the taxonomy of various\
    \ real-world \napplications and QoS comparison are described.  \n \nSection 5\
    \ discusses existing middleware technologies \nand cloud platforms are discussed.\
    \ A discussion of a \nvariety of benefits and challenges related to CoT is \n\
    provided in sections 6 and section 7.  \n \nDiscussion of IoT cloud integration\
    \ discusses in \nSection 8. Finally, section 9 summarizes the findings \nof this\
    \ study and provides a roadmap for the future. \nInternational Journal of Advanced\

    \ work  \nOver the past decade, a number of studies have been \nconducted to provide\
    \ insight into the topic of IoT and \ncloud computing solutions. These studies\
    \ helped to \naddress the emerging concern. Our study has been \nenriched with\
    \ comprehensive literature reviews \ncovering a variety of disciplines in this\
    \ area of \nresearch.  \n \nThe articles [3941] considered recent attempts to\
    \ \nintegrate cloud computing into a range of IoT \nscenarios and applications.\
    \ An extensive review of \nthe literature was conducted by Botta et al. [42] \n\
    where they explored the complementary aspects of \nIoT and cloud, and the factors\
    \ which drive their \nintegration into various infrastructures. The recent \n\
    acceptance of the cloud-based IoT paradigm has \nopened a wide variety of new\
    \ applications, which are \npresented along with the major research challenges.\
    \ \nFurther analysis of these challenges led to the \ndevelopment of research\
    \ directions. Additionally, by \ncomparing its numerous features, platforms, and\
    \ \naccessible operations, they highlighted problems and \nfuture research areas\
    \ in this domain. \n \nAn analysis of cloud platforms, cloud infrastructures,\
    \ \nand middleware technologies for the IoT has been \nconducted by Diaz et al.\
    \ [43]. A wide array of data \nanalysis techniques, approaches, and issues are\
    \ also \naddressed, as well as various research challenges. \n \nDang et al. [44]\
    \ aim to investigate the scope of IoT \napplications, implementations in the health\
    \ sector, \nand evaluations of cloud-based IoT platforms that \nhave been developed\
    \ over the last year. The goal of \nthis research is to explore how developing\
    \ \ntechnologies including the cloud, wireless networks, \nBig Data, and wearable\
    \ devices may be utilised to \nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare\
    \ \nby introducing health policies for the IoT and eHealth \nservices around the\
    \ world. Several security and \nprivacy risks associated with the IoT are also\
    \ \ndiscussed in depth, including issues, threats, and risk \nfactors. \nA \n\
    subsequent \nIoT-based \nhealthcare \ndevelopment is discussed in terms of analytical\
    \ \nframeworks that can be used to identify and evaluate \nsecurity threats, mitigation\
    \ strategies, and limitations. \nAs part of their discussion on the IoT, Malik\
    \ and Om \n[45] examined the platforms, devices, and available \nsolutions. The\
    \ IoT layer architectures were compared \nto the internet protocol (IP) layer\
    \ as well as its \nqualities. Additionally, a comparison of IoT and \ncloud technology\
    \ has been conducted. Moreover, a \nframework for integrating IoT with cloud services\
    \ \nhas been developed utilizing 6LowPanel and \narchitecture. Cloud computing\
    \ has been discussed, as \nconstrained application protocol (CoAP). However, \n\
    for standardized cloud and IoT integration to reach its \nfull potential, additional\
    \ studies in other sectors are \nrequired. \n \nAmairah et al. [46] examined the\
    \ reference \narchitectures and definitions of IoT and cloud \ncomputing, as well\
    \ as the associated security \nconcerns \nand \nsolutions. \nAdditionally, \n\
    future \ndirections were studied by evaluating the most often \ncited researchers.\
    \ Additional study is recommended \nto examine and address integration system\
    \ security \nvulnerabilities as new research areas in this domain. \nDuring an\
    \ extensive study conducted by Atlam et al. \n[47] on the integration of cloud\
    \ technologies with IoT \nplatforms and compare IoT and cloud technologies. \n\
    Six main benefits have been discussed that are related \nto \nIoT \ncloud \nintegration.\
    \ \nCloud-based \nIoT \narchitecture has been proposed in this study. In \naddition,\
    \ various IoT-cloud applications have been \npresented. Authors have studied the\
    \ seven main \nchallenges of cloud-based IoT integrations. \n \n The study presented\
    \ by Cavalcante et al. [48] \ndiscussed an overview of the current development\
    \ \nand investigations of IoT cloud integration and \nManzoor Ansari et al. \n\
    1820 \n \ndiscusses future directions. Moreover, four main \ntypes have suggested\
    \ (i) IoT cloud architecture (ii) \nplatforms (iii) framework, and (iv) middle-ware\
    \ \ntechnologies. Also, different challenges have been \ndiscussed in this study.\
    \ These challenges are (i) \nstandardizing IoT products, data, and services \n\
    delivered over the cloud; (ii) \nenabling IoT \ndevices/applications to efficiently\
    \ utilize cloud \nresources; (iii) Handling enormous amounts of data \nin \nreal-time;\
    \ \n(iv) \nProviding \ncontext-specific \ninformation; (v) Assuring the security\
    \ and privacy of \ndata by providing effective solutions (vi) removing \nthe large\
    \ degree of variability inherent in both IoT \nand cloud settings; (vii) Considering\
    \ concerns about \nflexibility and dependability; (viii) assist for cloud-\nbased\
    \ IoT developing and maintaining software, and \n(ix) offering virtualization\
    \ paradigms for devices. \nTable 1 illustrates a study of the existing research\

    \ We \nexcluded 129 articles from the proposed taxonomy \nsince these articles\
    \ lack experimental evaluations or \ncomparisons of their approaches. Except for\
    \ 129 \narticles, 170 experimental evaluations based on the \nproposed taxonomy\

    \ IoT-cloud applications \nA technical review of selected IoT-based cloud \napplications\
    \ is presented in this section, in \naccordance with the systematic review process\
    \ used \nin the existing studies. There are many types of IoT \ncloud applications,\
    \ but some of the most common are \nthose that allow for remote monitoring and\
    \ control of \ndevices; data collection and analysis, and platform \nfor deploying\
    \ IoT applications. \n \nIn Figure 17 a taxonomy of IoT-cloud applications is\
    \ \ndepicted, which includes applications related to \nhealthcare, environment,\
    \ agriculture, smart cities, and \nindustry [56]. To make the IoT-cloud applications\
    \ \nmore efficient and effective in real-life deployments, \nseveral constraints\
    \ may need to be addressed. \n   \nIn this review, we examine literature addressing\
    \ some \nof the issues involved with supporting IoT-enabled \ncloud applications\
    \ in a particular field. Accordingly, \nthis study's taxonomy is determined by\
    \ the specifics \nof the different IoT-cloud applications discussed in \nthe subsequent\
    \ section. Our study examines the type \nof IoT-cloud applications, and then examines\
    \ the \ncontext within which the literature was presented, to \nassess the challenges\
    \ and concerns associated with \nthem. A brief overview of IoT-cloud applications\
    \ is \nprovided in the following subsections. Furthermore, \nthe different studies\
    \ will be compared from several \nperspectives, \nincluding \ntheir \ncontext,\
    \ \ndomain, \nmechanism, significance differences, and limitations \nthat shown\
    \ in the following Table 4. In addition, \nTable 5 to Table 9 provide an analysis\
    \ of QoS factors \nassociated with various domains of applications. \nHealthcare\
    \  \nHealthcare \nIoT \napplications \nare \ncloud-based \napplications that enable\
    \ healthcare providers to \nremotely monitor and manage the health of their \n\
    patients. These applications use sensors and other \ndevices to collect data from\
    \ patients, and then use \ncloud computing to analyze and store the data. \nHealthcare\
    \ providers can use these applications to \ntrack the health of their patients\
    \ and to provide them \nwith timely information and advice. A cloud-based \nIoT\
    \ architecture may lead to more sophisticated \nhealthcare applications. In hospitals,\
    \ sensor networks \nare used to gather information about the health of \npatients\
    \ [57, 58].  \n \nAn evaluation of the studies is presented in Table 5 \nby combining\
    \ the evaluation elements within \nhealthcare IoT applications. Availability,\
    \ real-time, \nartificial intelligence (AI), latency, cost, reliability, \nsecurity,\
    \ energy consumption, and Big Data are some \nparameters considered. Furthermore,\
    \ Figure 18(a) \nillustrates that most research papers in this field \nevaluate\
    \ their proposed approach in terms of real-\ntime, cost, and security concerns.\
    \ \nEnvironment monitoring \nIoT devices may produce large amounts of data, \n\
    which can be challenging to store and analyse. The \ndata collected from the sensors\
    \ can be stored in the \ncloud \nand \nanalyzed \nfor \nuse \nin \nmonitoring\
    \ \nenvironmental conditions, such as air quality or water \nlevels. By providing\
    \ feedback on how IoT devices \nManzoor Ansari et al. \n1828 \n \nare utilised,\
    \ such data can also be used to improve \ntheir efficiency. As a smartphone can\
    \ do various \nactivities, the smart home is based on an innovative \nmobile phone\
    \ paradigm.  A network system connects \nthe devices to perform activities automatically\
    \ \naccording to the user's preferences through the IoT \n[59, 60]. \n \nTable\
    \ 6 compares and evaluates studies based on the \napplication of evaluating aspects\
    \ to IoT applications. \nSeveral \nparameters \nare \nevaluated, \nincluding \n\
    availability, real-time, AI, latency, cost, reliability, \nsecurity, energy consumption,\
    \ and Big Data. Further, \nFigure 18 (b) illustrates that most research studies\
    \ \nevaluated \nthe \nreal-time, \ncost, \nand \nreliability \ncharacteristics\
    \ of the health-care approach. \nAgriculture  \nAgriculture is a rapidly increasing\
    \ use of the IoT \nthese days.  Mobile phones are being used by farmers \nto monitor\
    \ their fields and take necessary actions \nagainst unwanted insects, such as\
    \ irrigation, insect \nscreening and fungicide applications in the field. \nAdditionally,\
    \ smart objects powered by the IoT are \nextensively used in the various poultry\
    \ and \nagriculture industries [61, 62]. \n \nAs shown in Table 7 an evaluation\
    \ element \ncomparison for IoT applications in agriculture is \npresented. In\
    \ addition to availability, real-time, AI, \nlatency, \ncost, \nreliability, \n\
    security, \nenergy \nconsumption, and Big Data, several parameters are \nanalyzed.\
    \ As can be seen in Figure 18 (c), most \nresearch studies evaluated the real-time,\
    \ cost, \navailability, AI, latency, security, and reliability \ncharacteristics\
    \ of agriculture solutions. \nSmart city \nA smart city IoT-cloud application\
    \ can help to \nmanage a city's infrastructure and resources more \nefficiently.\
    \ Several IoT-driven smart city initiatives \nare proving to deliver tangible\
    \ benefits to all citizens. \nSeveral ecosystems contribute to the development\
    \ of \nsmart cities. Many prominent innovations that help to \nthe establishment\
    \ of smart cities include energy \nmanagement and transportation management [63,\
    \ \n64]. \n \nA summary of each of the literatures, based on the \nelements used\
    \ in IoT applications for smart cities, is \npresented in Table 8. As part of\
    \ this analysis, we \nconsider the following parameters: availability, real-\n\
    time, AI, latency, cost, reliability, security, and \nenergy consumption. According\
    \ to Figure 18 (d), \nmost studies investigating smart city approaches \nevaluated\
    \ their offerings in terms of availability, cost, \nreliability, and energy consumption.\
    \ \nIndustrial \nIndustrial IoT (IIoT) is a novel intelligent industrial \nmanagement\
    \ technique that leverages intelligent \ndevices, sensors, and computer systems.\
    \ IIoT enables \nenterprises to get real-time data on their inventories \nand\
    \ manufacturing units, as well as a sensor-enabled \nalarms system that alerts\
    \ staff. Sensor data is \nrecorded and evaluated to determine the sensors' \n\
    future and direction [65, 66]. According to Table 9, \nthe papers were evaluated\
    \ by using evaluation \nelements for applications related to IIoT. As part of\
    \ \nthis assessment, we will consider the following \nparameters: availability,\
    \ real-time, AI, latency, cost, \nreliability, \nsecurity, \nand \nenergy \nconsumption.\
    \ \nAccording to Figure 18 (e), most research papers on \nIIoT applications evaluated\
    \ what they suggested \nregarding availability, real-time, cost, reliability,\
    \ and \nenergy consumption. \n \n \nFigure 17 Taxonomy of IoT-cloud applications\

    \ comprise a wide variety of \ndevices such as embedded devices, sensor devices,\
    \ \ncommunication devices, and mobile devices. In the \nabsence \nof \nadequate\
    \ \nstorage \nand \nprocessing \nresources, the IoT-based system cannot retain\
    \ and \nprocess large volumes of sensor-driven data. As a \nresult, the IoT system\
    \ will need assistance in \novercoming these constraints.  \nCloud computing provides\
    \ an unlimited storage \ncapacity, enormous computational power, and \nnetwork\
    \ bandwidth, among other capabilities which \nmay assist the IoT system in addressing\
    \ the barriers \ndescribed prior. Cloud computing resources are \nelastic, allowing\
    \ them to grow and contract in \nresponse to the IoT environment's requirements.\
    \ \nSensor data analysis may also be aided by cloud-\nbased Big Data analytics\
    \ [122,123]. Cloud computing \nintegration with IoT systems improves the efficiency\
    \ \nand reliability of IoT-based applications. An array of \nbenefits can be achieved\
    \ by combining the IoT with \ncloud computing. Following are some of the \nadvantages.\
    \ \nData transmission  \nCloud-based \nIoT \nparadigms \nallow \nefficient \n\
    transmission. IoT applications provide low-cost data \ntransmission between nodes.\
    \ Cloud computing \nenables the cost-effective and efficient connection, \ncontrol,\
    \ and exchange of data via the use of \nintegrated applications. \nStorage  \n\
    The IoT ecosystem is composed of several associated \ngadgets and sensors that\
    \ cause enormous amounts of \nreal-time data. Local storage on the IoT is insufficient\
    \ \nto hold this volume of data. Additionally, a large \nnumber of IoT devices\
    \ generate both structured and \nunstructured \ndata. \nConventional \ndatabases\
    \ \nare \nincapable of holding such a diverse set of data. Cloud \ncomputing enables\
    \ IoT devices to overcome this data \nstorage challenge. Cloud computing is comprised\
    \ of a \ngroup of commodity computers equipped with a \nsignificant quantity of\
    \ inbuilt storage. Cloud-based \nIoT systems allow users to store data and access\
    \ it \nfrom anywhere using the internet. Additionally, this \nvast data storage\
    \ may be leveraged to address the \nheterogeneity of devices by enabling analytics\
    \ and \nsystem enhancements. \nProcessing  \nIoT devices have rudimentary computing\
    \ power. As a \nresult, they are incapable of processing massive \namounts of\
    \ data generated by millions of linked, \nintelligent \ngadgets. \nCloud \ncomputing\
    \ \noffers \ncomputational capacity for IoT devices by dividing \nthe real computer\
    \ into several virtual ones. A virtual \ncomputer may be rented through Internet-enabled\
    \ \ndevices on a pay-per-use basis. Due to the integration \nof IoT technology\
    \ into cloud services, end users can \nbenefit from low-cost computing power while\
    \ \ngenerating high income. \nModern capacities  \nMultiple operational devices\
    \ are interconnected via \nIoT-enabled devices. These devices communicate \nusing\
    \ a variety of protocols and techniques. As a \nresult, coordination between these\
    \ disparate devices \nis \ndifficult. \nAdditionally, \nobtaining \nmaximum \n\
    dependability and efficiency might be difficult. Cloud \ncomputing is characterized\
    \ by its elasticity and ease \nof usage. By integrating cloud computing with IoT,\
    \ \nusers can be assured that their applications are more \nreliable, scalable,\
    \ secure, and efficient. \nModels for the cloud of things \nSaaS, IaaS, and PaaS\
    \ are the three primary \ndeployment methods for cloud computing. With the \n\
    combination of cloud and IoT, new deployment \nmethods have been developed, including\
    \ the \nfollowing: \n Sensing as a Service (SaaS) provides services for \nacquiring\
    \ access to the information collected by \nIoT sensors. \n Integration Platform\
    \ as a Servic (IPaaS) allows \nidentifying devices connected to the network and\
    \ \nsetting up access control policies. \n The Database as a Service (DBaaS)\
    \ is involved in \nboth database administration and storage services. \n Ethernet\
    \ as a Service (EaaS) enables IoT-enabled \ndevices to connect to the internet.\
    \ \n The Sensor and Actuation as a Service (SAaaS) \nensures automatic control\
    \ of sensors and devices. \n \nTable 10 Existing IoT-cloud platforms \nPlatforms\

    \ \n \n7.The challenges and open research issues \nof the cloud of things (CoT)\
    \ \nThe Integration of the IoT with cloud technology is \nproblematic and a number\
    \ of problems remain \nunresolved. A number of legitimate concerns have \nbeen\
    \ identified: \n \nPrivacy and security \nIn developing IoT-based cloud services,\
    \ privacy and \nsecurity are the key concerns. The IoT-based Cloud \nenables the\
    \ transfer of real-world data to the cloud. In \norder to ensure only authorized\
    \ customers have \naccess to data, it is important to determine how \neffectively\
    \ authorization rules and regulations should \nbe enforced. As a precaution, critical\
    \ information \nshould be shielded from unwanted access. Cloud-\nbased IoT devices\
    \ pose a number of challenges, such \nas the lack of transparency in service-level\
    \ agreemen \n(SLAs), data privacy, and the remote-access of the \nsystem. Additionally,\
    \ multi-tenancy may result in the \nrestriction of sensitive data using public\
    \ key \ncryptography. In comparison, serious problems, such \nas user takeover\
    \ and virtual machine rescue, are also \na source of concern. The researchers\
    \ [124], make an \nassault on the system and provide a recommendation. \nUsing\
    \ neural networks (NN) and cloud trace back \n(CTB) technologies, they propose\
    \ a method to \nidentify the cause of attacks. \nIpv6 addressing strategies  \n\
    It is widely recognized that the Internet is a key \ncomponent of the IoT. IPv4\
    \ has a profound influence \non the IoT. The CoAP technology allows devices and\
    \ \nservers to communicate directly over the internet. As \npart of the future\
    \ development of these technologies, \nnetwork address translation (NAT) operations\
    \ will be \neliminated in order to provide a specific IP address to \nthe expanding\
    \ IoT platform or network. IPv6 is \ndesigned \nto \novercome \nIPv4's \nlimitations\
    \ \nby \nemploying a 128-bit Internet Protocol address. There \nare numerous benefits\
    \ to RESTful interfaces, \nincluding the availability of an almost unlimited \n\
    number of Internet-connected devices, cross-platform \ncompatibility, and compliance\
    \ with REST protocol \nagreements. The IP protocol 6LoWPAN and ZigBee \ncan be\
    \ applied to integrated IoT devices to implement \nIPv6, however, several platforms\
    \ are yet to \nimplement these protocols. IPv6 is used by the IoT \nnetwork, which\
    \ originates from human-initiated \nnetworks. \nInteroperability  \nDue to the\
    \ diverse and independent nature of IoT \ndevices, interoperability is a critical\
    \ challenge in \ncloud-based IoT systems. Several forms of work have \nbeen conducted\
    \ in this area during the past several \nyears to address this issue. Due to the\
    \ heterogeneity \nof cloud platforms and applications, the presented \nmethodologies\
    \ \ngive \na \nvariety \nof \nsolutions. \nAdditionally, lack of compatibility\
    \ may result in the \ndifficulty to construct cross-platform and cross-\ndomain\
    \ applications [125]. \nIntelligent analytics  \nIntelligent analytics can provide\
    \ insights into large \nvolumes of data collected from connected devices. \nThis\
    \ data can be used to identify patterns and trends, \nuncover anomalies, and provide\
    \ predictive analytics \nto help inform decisions. Intelligent analytics can \n\
    also be used to create automated control systems, \nallowing for more efficient\

    \ Additionally, \nintelligent analytics can help improve customer \nexperience\
    \ by providing personalized services and \ntargeted recommendations [126,127].\
    \ \nIntegration methodology  \nBy combining present and future intelligent cyber-\n\
    physical systems into fully realised IoT, the demand \nfor interoperability cannot\
    \ be neglected. There are no \nexisting IoT standards or approaches for integrating\
    \ \nIoT systems due to their diverse nature and \ninteroperability [128]. The\
    \ heterogeneity issue might \nbe exacerbated when end users utilize multi-Cloud\
    \ \nsolutions, since applications depend on a multitude of \nproviders to support\
    \ scalability and efficiency. \nHeterogeneity \nIoT and cloud computing are hindered\
    \ by the \ncomplexity of legacy systems, platforms, operating \nsystems, and services.\
    \ As a result, the heterogeneity \nproblem may worsen dramatically as end users\
    \ adopt \nmulti-cloud solutions, where applications become \nincreasingly dependent\
    \ on the capabilities provided \nby numerous providers. \nStandardizations \n\
    A number of experts have acknowledged that the lack \nof standards is one of the\
    \ major challenges facing \nCloudIoT models in recent years. IoT-based Cloud \n\
    paradigms require standardized protocols, interfaces, \nand APIs to interconnect\
    \ heterogeneous intelligent \nobjects and provide unique services. Many IoT and\
    \ \ncloud \ndeployment \napproaches \nhave \nbeen \nrecommended by the technical\
    \ community. \n \nEdge/Fog computing  \nComputing can be applied at the edge of\
    \ providing \ncloud-based services. To assist customers with their \ncloud computing\
    \ needs, Fog provides application \nservices. As a generalisation, fog is an expansion\
    \ of \nthe cloud system that connects the cloud to the \nnetwork's edge. To achieve\
    \ latency constraints, \nadditional nodes are necessary for services that are\
    \ \nlatency-sensitive. Although Cloud and Fog are highly \ndependent \non \nprocessing,\
    \ \nnetworking, \nand \ncomputing. \nCloud capabilities  \nAn IoT architecture\
    \ based on the cloud poses a \nsignificant security risk to every networked system.\
    \ \nThere are additional attack vectors on both the IoT \nand cloud sides. An\
    \ IoT setting can benefit from \nencryption for data privacy, confidentiality,\
    \ and \nauthentication. On the other hand, internal threats \ncannot be defeated,\
    \ and operating IoT devices with \nlimited functionality is equally problematic.\
    \ \nS.L.A. implementation  \nCloud-based IoT applications enable the transmission\
    \ \nand storage of data created within the confines of \napplication-specific\
    \ \nlimits, \nwhich \nmight \nbe \ntroublesome in certain cases.  \n \nA single\
    \ provider may not always be sufficient to \nassure a specified level of QoS.\
    \ As a result, it is \nlikely to require the support of several cloud service\
    \ \nproviders for addressing SLA violations. \nBig Data  \nThe pervasiveness of\
    \ mobile devices and sensors \nnecessitates the use of modular systems. As a result,\
    \ \nseveral Cloud service providers may be required to \navoid breaches of S.L.A.\
    \ files. However, the \nflexibility of the most regularly come up of cloud \n\
    services is still an unresolved problem because of the \ntime, cost, and maintenance\
    \ of QoS complexity. \nPower and energy efficiency \nDuring the past decade, IoT-enabled\
    \ applications \nhave enabled frequent data flow between IoT devices \nand the\
    \ cloud, which has resulted in rapid power \nconsumption on the nodes. Consequently,\
    \ the data \nprocessing and transmission industries continue to \nprioritize energy\
    \ efficiency. \nPerformance  \nSeveral cloud computing and IoT technologies (such\
    \ \nas networking, processing, and storage) are difficult \nto \nstandardize \n\
    due \nto \ntheir \nscale-dependent \nperformance requirements. \nReliability \
    \ \nCloud computing and IoT convergence typically \nintroduce dependability concerns\
    \ in mission-critical \napplications. For example, in the domain of \nintelligent\
    \ mobility, vehicles are frequently in \nmotion, and automotive networking and\
    \ connection \nare frequently irregular and inefficient. In a resource-\nconstrained\
    \ setting, a range of issues relating to \nsystem breakdown or systems that are\
    \ not always \napproachable are highlighted. \nMonitoring \nIn cloud environments,\
    \ monitoring is essential for \nbatch processing, resource management, S.L.A.s,\
    \ \ndependability and security, and troubleshooting. \nConsequently, the cloud-based\
    \ IoT system adheres to \nall the same requirements as a traditional cloud \n\
    monitoring system, despite the IoT's inherent \nchallenges associated with speed,\
    \ volume, and \ndiversity. \n \n8.Discussion \nIn an effort to maximize the yield\
    \ of IoT and cloud \nintegration, researchers from around the world have \nexplored\
    \ a variety of technological solutions. IoT and \ncloud computing are two buzzword-rich\
    \ digital \nInternational Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration,\
    \ Vol 9(97)                                 \n1839          \n \ntransformation\
    \ topics that have been the focus of a lot \nof attention in recent years. This\
    \ research reviews \nmultiple aspects of IoT-based cloud applications (i.e., \n\
    health-care, environment, agriculture, smart city, and \nindustry). Furthermore,\
    \ various QoS factors (such as \navailability, AI, reliability, security, real-time,\
    \ and \nBig Data) have been analysed for each domain. For \ndeeper insight, a\
    \ comprehensive review of various \nexisting \nplatforms \nand \nenabling \nmiddleware\
    \ \ntechnologies also have been synthesized. There are \nfollowing potential impacts\
    \ of methods and platforms \nfor IoT cloud integration which include: \n Increased\
    \ \nefficiency \nand \nproductivity: \nBy \nautomating tasks and monitoring devices\
    \ and \nsystems \nremotely, \nbusinesses \ncan \nimprove \noperational efficiency\
    \ and productivity. \n Improved decision making: With real-time data \nand analytics,\
    \ IoT-enabled cloud applications can \nmake better informed decisions about their\
    \ \noperations. \n Enhanced \ncustomer \nexperience: \nIoT-enabled \nbusinesses\
    \ \ncan \nprovide \nbetter \ncustomer \nexperiences by customizing products and\
    \ services \nto meet customer needs. \n Reduced costs: Automation and remote\
    \ monitoring \ncan help businesses reduce costs associated with \nlabour, energy,\
    \ and other resources.  \n Enhanced security: Cloud-based IoT platforms can \n\
    offer enhanced security features such as data \nencryption and user authentication.\
    \ This can help \norganizations to protect their data and prevent \nunauthorized\
    \ access. \n Increased scalability: Cloud-based IoT platforms \noffer \nincreased\
    \ \nscalability, \nwhich \nallows \norganizations to easily add or remove devices\
    \ and \nusers as per their requirement. \nFurthermore, this article uses PRISMA\
    \ guidelines for \nquality assessment. Our primary objective is to \nidentify\
    \ the current state of the art of integrating IoT \ncloud technologies and map\
    \ the key research areas \nand future development trends. To achieve this \nobjective,\
    \ a comprehensive literature review was \nconducted and a total of 63 papers were\
    \ identified \nand analyzed. The results of the bibliometric analysis \nshowed\
    \ that the field of IoT cloud integration is a \nrelatively new research area\
    \ with a rapidly growing \nbody of literature. However, there are some \nlimitations\
    \ of IoT and cloud integration as follows: \n Security issues: It is important\
    \ to note that security \nis one of the primary concerns with the IoT. There \n\
    is a potential for hackers to gain access to IoT \ndevices which are constantly\
    \ connected to the \ninternet. \n Privacy concerns: Another concern is the privacy\
    \ \nof data. IoT devices may capture a plethora of \ninformation about individuals\
    \ and their actions. \nThere is a possibility that this information could be \n\
    used to follow individuals or compromise their \nprivacy. \n Reliability: One\
    \ of the most challenging aspects of \nIoT network is the reliability of data.\
    \ IoT devices \ncan malfunction or lose data. This data may not be \nbacked up\
    \ and could be lost forever.  \n Lack of standardizations: The major limitation\
    \ of \nIoT cloud integration is the lack of standardization. \nThere is no such\
    \ standard protocol that fits to all \nsolution for integrating IoT devices and\
    \ data into \nthe cloud. Each cloud provider has their own \nproprietary solution,\
    \ which makes it difficult to \nintegrate multiple IoT devices and platforms.\
    \ In \naddition, many IoT devices are not compatible \nwith standard cloud technologies,\
    \ which further \ncomplicates integration. \n Dependence \non \ninternet: \n\
    IoT \ndevices \nare \ndependent on the internet for data transmission. If \nthere\
    \ is no internet connection, the devices will not \nbe able to function properly.\
    \ \n Cost: The IoT and cloud computing integration \ncan be costly, as organizations\
    \ need to invest in \nhardware, software, and services. \n Complexity: The convergence\
    \ of IoT with cloud \ncomputing might be complex since it requires for \nthe deployment\
    \ of a \nvariety of different \ntechnologies. \n \nA complete list of abbreviations\
    \ is shown in \nAppendix I. \n \n9.Conclusion and future directions \nAs the IoT\
    \ continues to grow in popularity, so does \nthe need for efficient and reliable\
    \ cloud integration \nsolutions. In light of systematic literature reviews \n\
    (SLRs), the integration of IoT devices with cloud-\nbased applications has emerged\
    \ as an attractive \napproach. This article is intended to provide an \nassessment\
    \ of the current status of IoT and cloud \nintegration, including a review of\
    \ available SLR \ntools, middlewares and platforms. Despite the \npotential of\
    \ cloud integration for IoT, there are still \nseveral significant challenges\
    \ to be overcome. First, \nthe development of IoT cloud integration solutions\
    \ is \nstill in its early stages, and there is a lack of mature \nand robust tools\
    \ and platforms. Second, the use of \nIoT cloud integration solutions often requires\
    \ a \nsignificant amount of manual effort, which can be \ntime-consuming and error-prone.\
    \ As part of this \nstudy, we aim to investigate various aspects of cloud \nManzoor\
    \ Ansari et al. \n1840 \n \ncomputing and the IoT, as well as advantages and \n\
    limitations of a synergistic approach. The PRISMA \nmethod has been used for a\
    \ systematic literature \nreview. Literature identification and relevant articles\
    \ \ninclusion and exclusion have been made using the \nPRISMA technique. The Bibliometric\
    \ networks \nmethod, such as co-authorship analysis, and term co-\noccurrence,\
    \ has been used to analyze the literature. \nThe IoT powered by the cloud is paving\
    \ the way for \nnew \nbusiness \nopportunities \nand \nresearch \nopportunities.\
    \ \n \nIn the future, we believe that IoT cloud integration \nsolutions will become\
    \ more mature and robust and \nthat they will be increasingly used to integrate\
    \ IoT \ndevices with cloud-based applications.  \n \nThe future of IoT cloud integration\
    \ is looking \npromising with the advent of new technologies, \nincluding edge\
    \ computing, Big Data, blockchain, \nindustrial 5.0, 5G, and AI, the possibilities\
    \ for IoT \napplications are endless. In the near future, we can \nexpect to see\
    \ more IoT devices and applications \nbeing integrated into the cloud. This will\
    \ enable more \ndata to be gathered and processed, resulting in \nimproved \n\
    decision-making \nand \nmore \nefficient \noperations. Our research has revealed\
    \ that the \ncombination of these technologies could lead to new \nopportunities\
    \ for practitioners and researchers. \n \nAcknowledgment \nThe authors would like\

  title: 'Internet of things (IoT) fusion with cloud computing: current research and
    future direction'
  verbatim_quote1: Internet of things (IoT) represents a revolutionary concept that
    has become a part of modern society and is generating tremendous enthusiasm among
    both the business and academic communities [1]. IoT, as the next-generation technology,
    has enormous ramifications for many industries [1]. According to analyst predictions,
    the IoT could reach 64 billion devices by 2025, constituting one of the major
    sources of "Big Data," distinguished by volume, value, variety, velocity, and
    accuracy [24].
  verbatim_quote2: With the advent of the IoT, gigantic amounts of data are generated
    in real-time, and this poses a major concern for traditional cloud computing network
    topologies [11]. A traditional cloud infrastructure condenses all processing,
    storage, and networking into a limited set of data centers, and the distance between
    remote devices and remote data centers is relatively wide [12]. This challenge
    could be addressed by edge computing since it provides access to computing resources
    that are closer to the data source and may lead to a new ecosystem for IoT innovation
    [13].

    \ is no doubt that the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) in our daily\
    \ lives has\nchanged the way we live and interact as a global community, as IoT\
    \ enables intercommunication of\ndigital objects around us, creating a pervasive\
    \ environment. As of now, this IoT is found in almost\nevery domain that is vital\
    \ for human survival, such as agriculture, medical care, transportation, the\n\
    military, and so on. Day by day, various IoT solutions are introduced to the market\
    \ by manufacturers\ntowards making our life easier and more comfortable. On the\
    \ other hand, even though IoT now\nholds a key place in our lives, the IoT ecosystem\
    \ has various limitations in efﬁciency, scalability,\nand adaptability. As such,\
    \ biomimicry, which involves imitating the systems found in nature within\nhuman-made\
    \ systems, appeared to be a potential remedy to overcome such challenges pertaining\n\
    to IoT, which can also be referred to as bio-inspired IoT. In the simplest terms,\
    \ bio-inspired IoT\ncombines nature-inspired principles and IoT to create more\
    \ efﬁcient and adaptive IoT solutions, that\ncan overcome most of the inherent\
    \ challenges pertaining to traditional IoT. It is based on the idea\nthat nature\
    \ has already solved many challenging problems and that, by studying and mimicking\n\
    biological systems, we might develop better IoT systems. As of now, this concept\
    \ of bio-inspired IoT\nis applied to various ﬁelds such as medical care, transportation,\
    \ cyber-security, agriculture, and so on.\nHowever, it is noted that only a few\
    \ studies have been carried out on this new concept, explaining\nhow these bio-inspired\
    \ concepts are integrated with IoT. Thus, to ﬁll in the gap, in this study, we\n\
    provide a brief review of bio-inspired IoT, highlighting how it came into play,\
    \ its ecosystem, its latest\nstatus, beneﬁts, challenges, and future directions.\n\

    \ wireless sensor network\n1. Introduction\nThe proliferation of Information and\
    \ Communication Technologies (ICTs) early in\nthe 21st century has led to a revolution\
    \ in our daily lives in which we are able to perform\nmany tasks that were considered\
    \ difﬁcult with the use of available technologies at that\ntime [1]. Progressively,\
    \ this ICT has given birth to many advanced technologies, of which\nIoT can be\
    \ considered as one such major technology [2–5]. Over the years, this IoT has\
    \ been\nafﬁliated with many of the domains that are deemed important for human\
    \ survival, such\nas agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare\
    \ [6–9]. Undoubtedly, as of\nnow, this IoT can be considered a major technology\
    \ that is an essential part of our daily\nlives. Day by day, IoT solutions are\
    \ becoming more closely integrated into our daily lives,\nand such IoT solutions\
    \ are being introduced to the market at a rapid rate. In general, the\nIoT has\
    \ the capability to connect digital devices/objects all around the world and allow\n\
    them to communicate with each other, creating a larger ubiquitous network [10–12].\n\
    Overall, the IoT is an ecosystem of connected devices that communicate with each\n\
    other and exchange data. The integration of the IoT and the worldwide web has\

    creation of new kinds of services and applications in different domains, such\
    \ as real-time\nsurveillance, plant disease diagnosis, remote healthcare, real-time\
    \ disease diagnosis, preci-\nsion agriculture, air quality monitoring, and so\
    \ on [1–5,12–16]. In general, IoT facilitates\nus to connect our digital belongings\
    \ to the worldwide web, anytime, anywhere in the\nworld [17–21], as depicted in\
    \ Figure 1.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n2  of  28 \n \n \ncreation of new kinds of services and applications in different domains, such as real‐time \n\
    surveillance, plant disease diagnosis, remote healthcare, real‐time disease diagnosis, pre‐\n\
    cision agriculture, air quality monitoring, and so on [1–5,12–16]. In general, IoT facilitates \n\
    us to connect our digital belongings to the worldwide web, anytime, anywhere in the \n\
    world [17–21], as depicted in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1. The IoT ecosystem. \nDay by day, various IoT solutions are being introduced to the market owing to the \n\
    development of underlying infrastructure (e.g., communication facilities, computing fa‐\n\
    cilities) and the increasing technology competency of people. These ever‐growing IoT so‐\n\
    lutions are employed in a variety of domains and offer convenient facilities to the stake‐\n\
    holders engaged in these domains. According to the latest statistics, it is predicted that \n\
    there will be over 100 billion IoT devices by 2025 [5–10]. It is also evident that the IoT \n\
    market size is expected to reach over USD 140 billion by 2030 from USD 12 billion in 2020 \n\
    [5–10]. Overall, the IoT is transforming industries and revolutionizing the way we live \n\
    and work. However, even though IoT is a fast‐growing technology, it is still in its infancy, \n\
    and it will take years to become a stable technology [21–25]. As such, there are several \n\
    drawbacks and challenges associated with the incorporation and implementation of the \n\
    IoT (depicted in Figure 2), which are categorized and highlighted further in the following. \n\
     \nSecurity and privacy   \nSince IoT devices are always connected to the Internet, they can be vulnerable to \n\
    hacking, unauthorized access, and data breaches [10]. Further, weak security measures \n\
    and insufficient encryption can expose sensitive information, leading to privacy violations \n\
    and potential risks to individuals and organizations [26–28]. \n \nInteroperability issues \n\
    The IoT ecosystem involves a wide range of devices, protocols, and platforms from \n\
    various manufacturers [4]. Achieving seamless interoperability and compatibility among \n\
    these different components can be challenging whereas lack of standardized communica‐\n\
    tion protocols and fragmentation within the IoT industry can hinder device connectivity \n\
    and hinder the integration of IoT systems [4,5]. \n \nScalability and complexity \n\
    As the number of IoT devices increases, managing and scaling the infrastructure be‐\n\
    comes more complex [4,5]. Connecting and coordinating a large number of devices, man‐\n\
    aging  data  flows,  and  ensuring  efficient  data  processing  and  analysis \
    \ require  robust \nFigure 1. The IoT ecosystem.\nDay by day, various IoT solutions\
    \ are being introduced to the market owing to the de-\nvelopment of underlying\
    \ infrastructure (e.g., communication facilities, computing facilities)\nand the\
    \ increasing technology competency of people. These ever-growing IoT solutions\n\
    are employed in a variety of domains and offer convenient facilities to the stakeholders\n\
    engaged in these domains. According to the latest statistics, it is predicted\
    \ that there will\nbe over 100 billion IoT devices by 2025 [5–10]. It is also\
    \ evident that the IoT market size is\nexpected to reach over USD 140 billion\
    \ by 2030 from USD 12 billion in 2020 [5–10]. Overall,\nthe IoT is transforming\
    \ industries and revolutionizing the way we live and work. However,\neven though\
    \ IoT is a fast-growing technology, it is still in its infancy, and it will take\
    \ years\nto become a stable technology [21–25]. As such, there are several drawbacks\
    \ and challenges\nassociated with the incorporation and implementation of the\
    \ IoT (depicted in Figure 2),\nwhich are categorized and highlighted further in\
    \ the following.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3  of  28 \n \nsystems and architectures. Thus, scaling up IoT deployments can be challenging, particu‐\n\
    larly when dealing with legacy systems and integrating with existing IT infrastructure [3]. \n\
     \nPower and energy requirements \nMany IoT devices are small, battery‐powered devices designed to operate for ex‐\n\
    tended periods without human intervention. However, maintaining constant connectiv‐\n\
    ity, data transmission, and processing can drain device batteries quickly [10–13]. Thus, \n\
    energy efficiency becomes a crucial factor, especially for IoT deployments that involve a \n\
    massive number of devices or remote locations (e.g., in agricultural lands, mines etc.) \n\
    where the power supply is limited. \n \nData overload and management \nIoT generates vast amounts of data from multiple sources and sensors, where effec‐\n\
    tively managing, storing, analyzing, and deriving actionable insights from these data can \n\
    be a daunting task [10–13]. Thus, organizations need robust data management strategies, \n\
    including data storage, processing, and analytics capabilities, to make sense of the infor‐\n\
    mation generated by IoT devices. \n \nReliability and downtime \nIoT devices heavily rely on network connectivity and uninterrupted Internet access \n\
    [4,5]. Network outages, connectivity issues, or server downtime can impact the function‐\n\
    ality of IoT systems. Hence, dependence on stable network infrastructure and the poten‐\n\
    tial for single points of failure pose reliability challenges for IoT deployments [4,5]. \n\
     \nFigure 2. Challenges pertaining to IoT. \nAddressing these inherent drawbacks of IoT requires concerted efforts from manu‐\n\
    facturers, policymakers, and technology experts, and it will take years to tackle all these \n\
    drawbacks. As IoT continues to evolve, there is an ongoing need to prioritize security, \n\
    standardization,  data  management,  and  privacy  considerations  to  mitigate \
    \ these  chal‐\nlenges. On the whole, all the aforementioned drawbacks can be mainly apportioned into \n\
    scalability,  efficiency,  security,  and  adaptability  challenges.  As  a  remedy \
    \ to  overcome \nsuch challenges, bio‐inspired IoT emerged as a new paradigm that combines the princi‐\n\
    Figure 2. Challenges pertaining to IoT.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 373\n3 of 29\n•\n\
    Security and privacy\nSince IoT devices are always connected to the Internet,\
    \ they can be vulnerable to\nhacking, unauthorized access, and data breaches [10].\
    \ Further, weak security measures and\ninsufﬁcient encryption can expose sensitive\
    \ information, leading to privacy violations and\npotential risks to individuals\
    \ and organizations [26–28].\n•\nInteroperability issues\nThe IoT ecosystem involves\
    \ a wide range of devices, protocols, and platforms from\nvarious manufacturers\
    \ [4]. Achieving seamless interoperability and compatibility among\nthese different\
    \ components can be challenging whereas lack of standardized communication\nprotocols\
    \ and fragmentation within the IoT industry can hinder device connectivity and\n\
    hinder the integration of IoT systems [4,5].\n•\nScalability and complexity\n\
    As the number of IoT devices increases, managing and scaling the infrastructure\n\
    becomes more complex [4,5]. Connecting and coordinating a large number of devices,\
    \ man-\naging data ﬂows, and ensuring efﬁcient data processing and analysis require\
    \ robust systems\nand architectures. Thus, scaling up IoT deployments can be challenging,\
    \ particularly when\ndealing with legacy systems and integrating with existing\
    \ IT infrastructure [3].\n•\nPower and energy requirements\nMany IoT devices are\
    \ small, battery-powered devices designed to operate for extended\nperiods without\
    \ human intervention. However, maintaining constant connectivity, data\ntransmission,\
    \ and processing can drain device batteries quickly [10–13]. Thus, energy\nefﬁciency\
    \ becomes a crucial factor, especially for IoT deployments that involve a massive\n\
    number of devices or remote locations (e.g., in agricultural lands, mines etc.)\
    \ where the\npower supply is limited.\n•\nData overload and management\nIoT generates\
    \ vast amounts of data from multiple sources and sensors, where effec-\ntively\
    \ managing, storing, analyzing, and deriving actionable insights from these data\
    \ can\nbe a daunting task [10–13]. Thus, organizations need robust data management\
    \ strate-\ngies, including data storage, processing, and analytics capabilities,\
    \ to make sense of the\ninformation generated by IoT devices.\n•\nReliability\
    \ and downtime\nIoT devices heavily rely on network connectivity and uninterrupted\
    \ Internet access [4,5].\nNetwork outages, connectivity issues, or server downtime\
    \ can impact the functionality of\nIoT systems. Hence, dependence on stable network\
    \ infrastructure and the potential for\nsingle points of failure pose reliability\
    \ challenges for IoT deployments [4,5].\nAddressing these inherent drawbacks of\
    \ IoT requires concerted efforts from manu-\nfacturers, policymakers, and technology\
    \ experts, and it will take years to tackle all these\ndrawbacks. As IoT continues\
    \ to evolve, there is an ongoing need to prioritize security,\nstandardization,\
    \ data management, and privacy considerations to mitigate these challenges.\n\
    On the whole, all the aforementioned drawbacks can be mainly apportioned into\
    \ scal-\nability, efﬁciency, security, and adaptability challenges. As a remedy\
    \ to overcome such\nchallenges, bio-inspired IoT emerged as a new paradigm that\
    \ combines the principles of\nbiology with IoT.\nIn general, these bio-inspired\
    \ solutions, also known as biomimetic or nature-inspired\nsolutions, refer to\
    \ the development of technologies, strategies, and designs that draw\ninspiration\
    \ from biological systems found in nature [3,4]. These solutions aim to solve\n\
    complex problems by emulating or adapting principles, structures, processes, and\
    \ behaviors\nobserved in living organisms. Incorporating such solutions with IoT\
    \ leads to the creation\nof innovative and efﬁcient solutions enabling IoT to\
    \ overcome its inherent drawbacks [1–4].\nAccording to the literature, in the\
    \ area of bio-inspired IoT, little research has been carried\nBiomimetics 2023,\
    \ 8, 373\n4 of 29\nout and no reviews have synthesized the latest knowledge pertaining\
    \ to the subject area\nowing to the novelty of the ﬁeld. Thus, motivated by the\
    \ synthesis of the latest knowledge\npertaining to bio-inspired IoT, the following\
    \ describes the key contributions of the study.\n1.\nFollowing the Introduction,\
    \ we provide a brief review of what is meant by bio-\ninspiration, bio-inspired\
    \ IoT, and the beneﬁts and applications of bio-inspired IoT.\n2.\nThe latest status\
    \ of bio-inspired IoT is presented with use cases (highlighting domains\nthat\
    \ they are used in).\n3.\nA summarization of the state of the art is presented,\
    \ providing a summary of recent re-\nsearch and survey studies followed by a brief\
    \ comparison of IoT and bio-inspired IoT.\n4.\nTo make this a comprehensive review,\
    \ challenges and anticipated future directions\npertaining to the bio-inspired\
    \ IoT are also highlighted.\nTo carry out the review, we have followed a systematic\
    \ approach in which the initial\nstep encompasses the identiﬁcation of key terms\
    \ relevant to the topic, “bio-inspired Internet\nof Things”, “IoT”, “bio-inspired\
    \ algorithms”, and “IoT algorithms”. To effectively retrieve\npertinent scholarly\
    \ content, we have searched through the IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital\nLibrary, PubMed,\
    \ Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science scholarly databases. Upon\nexecuting\
    \ the search queries, the next phase involves the meticulous screening of search\n\
    results. Titles and abstracts of retrieved articles are carefully reviewed to\
    \ gauge their\nrelevance. To ensure the inclusion of high-quality and recent literature,\
    \ a set of inclusion\nand exclusion criteria is established where we have chosen\
    \ scholarly articles published\nfrom 2010 onwards. However, we have also referred\
    \ to the state of the art in 1998, 1999,\nand 2001, owing to the relevance of\
    \ the subject for our review (e.g., swarm intelligence).\nThe remainder of the\
    \ study is organized in the following order. Following the Introduc-\ntion, the\
    \ second section discusses bio-inspiration, bio-inspired solutions, and bio-inspired\n\
    IoT. Afterwards, the third section discusses the ecosystem of bio-inspired IoT,\
    \ highlighting\nthe architecture of bio-inspired IoT and bio-inspired algorithms.\
    \ Then, the fourth section\nsummarizes the state of the art. Challenges pertaining\
    \ to the bio-inspired IoT are high-\nlighted in Section 5 and current status and\
    \ future directions are highlighted in Section 6\nand, ﬁnally, the study concludes\

    literature, the field of bio‐inspired study can be apportioned into three primary fields [27–\n\
    30], as shown in Figure 3. \n \nFigure 3. Fields of bio‐inspired study. \n1. \n\

    Bio-inspired computing.\n2.\nBio-inspired systems.\n3.\nBio-inspired networking.\n\
    Bio-inspired computing focuses on optimization and efﬁcient computing and repre-\n\
    sents a class of algorithms that focus on efﬁcient computing, whereas bio-inspired\
    \ systems\nconstitute a class of system architectures for massively distributed\
    \ and collaborative sys-\ntems [25,29]. On the other hand, bio-inspired networking\
    \ is a set of approaches that are\nused for scabble and efﬁcient networking under\
    \ uncertain, volatile conditions [7,8,29].\nOverall, in order for a biological\
    \ idea to be applied, it needs to be comparable to an issue\nthat exists in the\
    \ actual world. It should be possible to put into action, and the procedure\n\
    for adapting it to a system in the actual world should be articulated in a way\
    \ that is obvious\nand concise. In this regard, the next section brieﬂy discusses\
    \ biomimicry, or bio-inspiration,\nand then the bio-inspired IoT solutions and\
    \ how they are formed.\n2.1. What Is Biomimicry?\nThe concept of biomimicry derives\
    \ its name from the combination of two Greek words,\n“bios”, meaning life, and\
    \ “mimesis”, meaning imitation [26]. Essentially, it involves imitat-\ning the\
    \ systems found in nature within human-made systems. Biomimicry encompasses\n\
    innovation inspired by nature, where engineers, knowledgeable about mechanics\
    \ and\ndynamic ﬂow systems in industrial processes, collaborate with biologists\
    \ who possess\nexpertise in the mechanics and dynamic ﬂow characteristics of living\
    \ processes [27–30].\nThroughout human existence, nature has provided solutions\
    \ to numerous complex\nproblems that engineers continue to face. By exploring\
    \ nature all around us, we can\ndiscover elegant and environmentally friendly\
    \ solutions that do not contribute to further\ndegradation. Nature avoids the\
    \ use of unnecessary toxic chemicals and manages waste\neffectively, either through\
    \ compensation or efﬁcient cleanup. For instance, Leonardo da\nVinci conceptualized\
    \ designs for helicopters and parachutes by studying natural systems,\nand the\
    \ Wright brothers examined birds to develop their ﬁrst ﬂying machine, which paved\n\
    the way for the development of modern aircraft [26–30]. This clearly indicates\
    \ how nature\nhas already solved many existing problems and how it holds the answers\
    \ for many of the\nchallenges that humankind is currently struggling with.\nOverall,\
    \ nature operates in a simple and sustainable manner. By emulating natural\nengineering,\
    \ individuals can strive for technological advancements while living harmo-\n\
    niously with nature and maintaining a balanced and equitable lifestyle. This approach\n\
    stands in contrast to current systems that disrupt harmony, pose risks to health\
    \ through\ntoxic elements, and strain ecosystem services. The emulation of nature’s\
    \ engineering\nsystems operates on three levels, according to [26].\n1.\nEmulating\
    \ the form and function of natural processes.\n2.\nEmulating the way nature produces\
    \ (engineers) biological components.\n3.\nExamining and understanding how nature\
    \ deals with all aspects of waste and regen-\neration through closed system thinking.\n\
    Starting from 1998, biomimicry has facilitated collaborations between engineering\n\
    ﬁrms and scientists to create eco-friendly and efﬁcient technology through redesign\
    \ and\nconstruction. Such example designs include modern automobiles, ﬁghter aircrafts,\
    \ bullet\ntrains, underwater submarines, etc. [26]. Overall, these nature-inspired\
    \ solutions have now\nbecome an essential part of our daily lives.\nHaving provided\
    \ a brief overview of what is meant by bio-inspiration, the next section\ndiscusses\
    \ such bio-inspired solutions in more detail.\n2.2. Bio-Inspired Solutions\nAs\
    \ aforementioned, the concept of bio-inspiration has inspired many domains to\n\
    create/implement novel solutions that can overcome many challenges that are otherwise\n\
    hard to overcome with traditional technologies. The process of designing bio-inspired\n\
    Biomimetics 2023, 8, 373\n7 of 29\nsolutions can be apportioned into ﬁve main\
    \ stages, as shown in Figure 4 [25,26,31]. It\ninvolves starting from understanding\
    \ the problem to be solved (problem), abstracting\nthe problem to be solved (reframe),\
    \ exactly identifying the problem and the solution\n(identify), analysis of biological\
    \ principles and abstraction to identify analogies, and, ﬁnally,\napplying bio-inspired\
    \ solutions to solve the problem (apply). For a better understanding,\nthe following\
    \ describes some of the remarkable bio-inspired solutions designed in recent\n\
    years inspired by the biological world.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\
    7  of  28 \n \nthe following describes some of the remarkable bio‐inspired solutions designed in recent \n\
    years inspired by the biological world. \n \nFigure 4. Process of designing a bio‐inspired solution. \n\
     \nRobotics and locomotion \nResearchers study animal locomotion to create robots and vehicles that can move \n\
    more efficiently and adapt to various terrains [2,3]. Such examples include robots inspired \n\
    by insects, birds, or marine creatures and the design of the high‐speed bullet trains in \n\
    Japan, which was inspired by the beak shape and aerodynamic efficiency of the kingfisher \n\
    [26], where the streamlined nose design reduces noise and enhances speed, making it an \n\
    iconic bio‐inspired solution in transportation. Another example is swarm robotics which \n\
    involves the coordination and cooperation of multiple robots to achieve collective behav‐\n\
    ior [6,20,26]. Inspired by the behavior of social insects like ants or bees, swarm robotics \n\

    Having discussed what is meant by bio-inspiration and bio-inspired solutions,\
    \ the\nnext section thoroughly discusses bio-inspired IoT.\n2.3. What Is Bio-Inspired\
    \ IoT?\nBio-inspired IoT is a concept that combines the principles of biology\
    \ and IoT to create\na more efﬁcient and adaptive system. It is based on the idea\
    \ that nature has already\nsolved many complex problems, and by studying and mimicking\
    \ biological systems, we\ncan develop better IoT systems to enhance the functionality\
    \ of such IoT systems toward\nimproving security, scalability, adaptability, efﬁciency,\
    \ and so on [1–5,32–36]. Overall, bio-\ninspired IoT can be deﬁned as the use\
    \ of bio-inspired computing techniques and algorithms\nto develop creative/novel\
    \ IoT systems that can overcome the inherent challenges of IoT,\nsuch as resource\
    \ constraints, low efﬁciency, and so on [17–20,37–40]. As of now, this bio-\n\
    inspired IoT is applied to various ﬁelds such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation,\n\
    smart cities, and so on.\nAccording to the state of the art, bio-inspired IoT\
    \ has several beneﬁts over traditional\nIoT systems, such as:\nBiomimetics 2023,\
    \ 8, 373\n9 of 29\n•\nScalability\nBio-inspired IoT systems can scale easily due\
    \ to the decentralized nature of biological\nsystems. They can handle a large\
    \ number of devices and data without compromising efﬁ-\nciency [23–25]. In this\
    \ regard, bio-inspired IoT algorithms, such as swarm intelligence [9,20],\nenable\
    \ efﬁcient scalability in IoT systems by leveraging collective intelligence and\
    \ self-\norganization, allowing devices to interact and cooperate locally. On\
    \ the other hand, this\nscalability feature enables bio-inspired IoT systems to\
    \ handle a growing number of devices,\ninteractions, and data, without lacking\
    \ efﬁciency and performance.\n•\nEfﬁciency\nBio-inspired IoT systems are energy-efﬁcient\
    \ as they can adapt to changing environ-\nmental conditions and optimize their\
    \ operations accordingly. In general, they optimize en-\nergy consumption, adjust\
    \ resource usage based on demand, and enable energy-harvesting\ntechniques [39].\
    \ This focus on energy efﬁciency leads to sustainability, longer device battery\n\
    life, and reduced environmental impact [23–25].\n•\nAdaptability\nBio-inspired\
    \ IoT systems can adapt to changing conditions and learn from their\nenvironment.\
    \ They can dynamically adjust to changing environmental conditions, network\n\
    conﬁgurations, and resource availability. This adaptability allows bio-inspired\
    \ IoT systems\nto handle uncertainties, ﬂuctuations, and unexpected events more\
    \ effectively as opposed to\ntraditional IoT [5,26].\n•\nResilience and autonomous\
    \ behavior\nBiological systems have evolved to be resilient to external disturbances,\
    \ and bio-\ninspired IoT systems can inherit these properties. They can recover\
    \ from failures and\ncontinue to operate efﬁciently under adverse circumstances\
    \ [26–30]. On the other hand,\nbio-inspired IoT systems can incorporate Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) and adaptive behavior.\nBy mimicking biological learning processes,\
    \ they can adapt and improve their performance\nover time. With the involvement\
    \ of AI, bio-inspired IoT systems can learn from data, adjust\ntheir parameters,\
    \ and make intelligent decisions, enhancing their autonomy and ability to\nhandle\
    \ complex tasks [9,16].\nBio-inspired IoT has a variety of applications across\
    \ various domains, as shown in\nFigure 6, which we have categorized according\
    \ to the state of the art. In the following, we\nbrieﬂy discuss these domains.\n\

    \ IoT solutions have been implemented in agriculture to improve crop\nyields,\
    \ optimize resource usage, and monitor environmental conditions [16,30–33]. For\n\
    instance, using sensors inspired by bee vision, IoT devices can monitor plant\
    \ health by\nanalyzing the reﬂection of light from leaves. This helps farmers\
    \ make informed decisions\nabout irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.\n\
    •\nHealthcare\nBio-inspired IoT devices are being used for remote health monitoring\
    \ and personalized\nmedicine. For example, wearable devices inspired by the structure\
    \ and functionality of\nhuman skin can continuously monitor vital signs, detect\
    \ abnormalities, and transmit data\nto healthcare providers in real time [17–21].\
    \ Nonetheless, bio-inspired IoT can be used to\nmonitor patients’ vital signs\
    \ and alert healthcare professionals in case of emergencies. It\ncan also be used\
    \ to track the spread of diseases and monitor outbreaks.\n•\nTransportation\n\
    Bio-inspired IoT can be used to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow and reduce congestion. It\
    \ can also\nbe used to monitor vehicle performance and reduce emissions [25–28].\n\
    •\nEnvironmental monitoring\nBio-inspired IoT systems can help monitor and manage\
    \ environmental conditions. For\ninstance, IoT sensors inspired by the sensory\
    \ capabilities of birds can detect air pollution,\nmonitor noise levels, or analyze\
    \ water quality in real time, contributing to early warning\nsystems and environmental\
    \ conservation efforts [18,25,26].\n•\nEnergy management\nInspired by the behavior\
    \ of social insect colonies, bio-inspired IoT systems can optimize\nenergy management\
    \ in smart grids or buildings [25–28]. By coordinating the energy\nconsumption\
    \ and production of multiple IoT devices, these systems can improve efﬁciency,\n\
    balance energy loads, and enable better integration of renewable energy sources.\n\
    •\nStructural health monitoring\nBio-inspired IoT solutions can be used to monitor\
    \ the structural health of buildings,\nbridges, and other infrastructure [3–5].\
    \ By mimicking the sensory capabilities of animals,\nsuch as bats or dolphins,\
    \ IoT sensors can detect and analyze vibrations, acoustic signals, or\nchanges\
    \ in electromagnetic ﬁelds to identify potential structural issues or defects.\n\
    •\nWildlife conservation\nIoT devices equipped with bio-inspired sensors and communication\
    \ mechanisms\nhave been deployed to monitor wildlife populations and protect endangered\
    \ species. For\nexample, researchers have developed bio-inspired camera traps\
    \ that mimic the visual and\nauditory cues of prey to attract and photograph elusive\
    \ or endangered animals [15,25,26].\n•\nMilitary\nBio-inspired IoT in the military\
    \ involves applying biological principles to design\nadaptable, resilient, energy-efﬁcient\
    \ IoT systems capable of self-organization, enhanced\nsensing, swarm intelligence,\
    \ stealth, and biometric security (e.g., swarm drones for recon-\nnaissance, biochemical\
    \ sensing, and energy-efﬁcient sensors) [25,26]. It aims to leverage\nnature-inspired\
    \ strategies for efﬁcient data processing, communication, and environmental\n\
    adaptation, enabling improved situational awareness, surveillance, reconnaissance,\
    \ and\nmission success.\n•\nSmart cities\nBio-inspired IoT can enhance the efﬁciency\
    \ of urban infrastructure and services. For\ninstance, researchers have looked\
    \ at the collective foraging behavior of ants to develop\nefﬁcient routing algorithms\
    \ for garbage collection and transportation networks [25,26].\nBiomimetics 2023,\
    \ 8, 373\n11 of 29\nBy applying these principles, IoT devices can optimize routes,\
    \ reduce congestion, and\nminimize energy consumption [3,25–28]. On the other\
    \ hand, bio-inspired IoT is used to\nmonitor air and water quality, detect and\
    \ prevent natural disasters, and improve energy\nefﬁciency in a typical smart\
    \ city.\n3. The Bio-Inspired IoT Ecosystem\nThe IoT is an ecosystem that comprises\
    \ various enabling technologies, of which\nIoT constitutes the core. The remaining\
    \ technologies that constitute an IoT ecosystem\ninclude cloud computing, fog\
    \ computing, edge computing, AI, underlying communication\ntechnologies, and so\
    \ on. Overall, the typical architecture of an IoT solution comprises\nthree or\
    \ four layers [32,33]. The three-layer architecture comprises a physical/sensing\n\
    layer, network/communication layer, and the application layer whereas the four-layer\n\
    architecture comprises an intermediate data-processing layer in between the network\
    \ and\nthe application layer [1,3,4]. On the other hand, when it comes to bio-inspired\
    \ IoT, the\npervasive ecosystem comprises underlying bio-inspired algorithms/techniques\
    \ that hold a\nkey place in the bio-inspired IoT ecosystem. The architecture of\
    \ bio-inspired IoT systems\nvaries depending on the speciﬁc application and the\
    \ level of bio-inspiration incorporated.\nHowever, there are certain common architectural\
    \ elements that are often present in bio-\ninspired IoT systems. To provide a\
    \ better understanding of the bio-inspired IoT ecosystem,\nthe next section discusses\
    \ further the architecture of bio-inspired IoT and underlying\nbio-inspired algorithms\

    \ intelligence, where individual IoT devices interact and\ncooperate to make decisions\
    \ [34–38].\n5.\nAdaptation and learning layer\nThe adaptation and learning layer\
    \ enables IoT devices to adapt their behavior and\nlearn from their environment.\
    \ It may include AI algorithms that enable devices to learn\nfrom data, adjust\
    \ their parameters, or optimize their performance over time, similar to the\n\
    adaptive behavior observed in biological systems [33–38].\n6.\nControl layer\n\
    The control layer coordinates and manages the operations of the IoT system. It\
    \ may\ninvolve hierarchical control mechanisms inspired by the organization and\
    \ coordination\nfound in biological systems, allowing for self-organization, self-healing,\
    \ and fault toler-\nance [34–38].\n7.\nApplication layer\nThe application layer\
    \ encompasses the speciﬁc applications and services enabled by\nbio-inspired IoT\
    \ systems used in various domains such as agriculture, smart city, and so on\n\
    as aforementioned.\nIt is noted that the architecture can be tailored to the speciﬁc\
    \ requirements of the\napplication. On the other hand, the level of bio-inspiration\
    \ can vary, ranging from incor-\nporating bio-inspired algorithms within speciﬁc\
    \ layers to developing fully bio-inspired\narchitectures [34–38]. Whilst developing\
    \ bio-inspired IoT solutions, the following key\nprinciples are also incorporated\
    \ into the architecture towards making sure such solutions\ncan overcome the challenges\
    \ associated with traditional IoT systems.\n•\nSelf-organization\nBio-inspired\
    \ IoT architectures emphasize self-organization, allowing devices to au-\ntonomously\
    \ form networks, adapt to changing conditions, and dynamically reconﬁgure\nthemselves\
    \ [10–13]. This concept draws inspiration from biological systems, such as ant\n\
    colonies or ﬂocking birds, where individual entities collectively organize and\
    \ collabo-\nrate [26].\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 373\n13 of 29\n•\nSwarm intelligence\n\
    Bio-inspired IoT can leverage swarm intelligence, which is inspired by the collective\n\
    behavior of social insects like bees or ants. In this approach, IoT devices interact\
    \ and share\ninformation to achieve speciﬁc goals through distributed decision\
    \ making and coordination.\nSwarm intelligence helps especially in achieving scalability,\
    \ fault tolerance, and robustness\nin IoT networks [20–23].\n•\nHierarchical structures\n\
    Inspired by biological systems with hierarchical structures, bio-inspired IoT\
    \ archi-\ntectures often adopt layered or hierarchical arrangements. This allows\
    \ for efﬁcient data\nprocessing and decision making at different levels, enabling\
    \ distributed intelligence and\nreducing the need for centralized control [15–19].\n\
    •\nAdaptive and resilient\nBio-inspired IoT architectures aim to be adaptive and\
    \ resilient, capable of responding\nto changes and disruptions. They can dynamically\
    \ adapt to environmental conditions,\nreconﬁgure themselves in the presence of\
    \ failures or changes, and continue operating\nreliably [24–26].\n•\nEnergy efﬁciency\n\
    Energy efﬁciency is a critical consideration in IoT deployments. Bio-inspired\
    \ ap-\nproaches can help optimize energy consumption by taking cues from energy-efﬁcient\n\
    mechanisms observed in biological systems, such as efﬁcient communication, resource\n\
    allocation, and power management strategies [24–26].\n•\nSensing and actuation\n\
    Bio-inspired IoT architectures often emphasize advanced sensing capabilities,\
    \ drawing\ninspiration from biological sensors and perception mechanisms [5–8,26].\
    \ These architec-\ntures may also incorporate actuation mechanisms to enable devices\
    \ to interact with the\nphysical world, much like organisms found in nature.\n\
    3.2. Bio-Inspired IoT Algorithms\nHaving described the core part of bio-inspired\
    \ IoT, this section discusses further bio-\ninspired IoT algorithms. Bio-inspired\
    \ IoT algorithms refer to the use of nature-inspired\napproaches to develop efﬁcient\
    \ and adaptive algorithms for IoT systems [3,5,24–28]. These\nalgorithms are based\
    \ on the principles of biology and are designed to solve complex prob-\nlems more\
    \ efﬁciently and effectively [39,40]. Overall, bio-inspired optimization algorithms\n\
    are an emerging approach that is based on the principles of and inspiration from\
    \ the\nbiological evolution of nature to develop new and robust computing techniques.\
    \ There\nare various taxonomies available for bio-inspired algorithms [18,24,25],\
    \ each with its own\npros and cons, and the following Figure 8 depicts a possible\
    \ classiﬁcation of bio-inspired\nIoT algorithms.\n1.\nPhysically Inspired Algorithms\
    \ (PIAs)\nIn general, PIAs draw inspiration from physical principles and phenomena\
    \ to solve\ncomplex problems. These algorithms attempt to replicate or mimic physical\
    \ processes or\nbehaviors to develop efﬁcient and effective problem-solving strategies.\
    \ By harnessing the\nprinciples observed in the physical world, PIAs offer alternative\
    \ approaches to traditional\ncomputational algorithms [25]. e.g., simulated annealing,\
    \ harmony search algorithm.\n2.\nNeural Networks and Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\
    \ (ANNs)\nThese algorithms aim to simulate the structure and functionality of\
    \ biological neural\nnetworks, such as the human brain. In general, they are computational\
    \ models composed of\ninterconnected artiﬁcial neurons, which process and transmit\
    \ information to perform tasks\nlike pattern recognition, classiﬁcation, and prediction\
    \ [40–45]. e.g., feedforward neural\nnetworks, perceptron, convolutional neural\
    \ networks.\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 373\n14 of 29\n3.\nEvolutionary Algorithms (EAs)\n\
    EAs are a class of computational optimization algorithms inspired by the principles\n\
    of biological evolution and natural selection. These algorithms mimic the process\
    \ of\nnatural evolution to search for optimal solutions to complex problems [45–47].\
    \ EAs operate\non a population of candidate solutions, evolving and improving\
    \ them over successive\ngenerations through the application of genetic operators\
    \ such as mutation, crossover, and\nselection. e.g., genetic algorithms.\n4.\n\
    Immunological Algorithms (IAs)\nIAs are inspired by the principles of the immune\
    \ system. These algorithms draw analo-\ngies from the behavior, mechanisms, and\
    \ processes of the immune system to solve complex\noptimization and pattern recognition\
    \ problems. IA models aim to mimic the adaptive and\nself-organizing nature of\
    \ the immune system to develop intelligent algorithms [25–27]. e.g.,\nartiﬁcial\
    \ immune systems, clonal selection algorithm, immune network algorithm.\n5.\n\
    Swarm Intelligence Algorithms (SIAs)\nSIAs are a class of computational methods\
    \ inspired by the collective behavior of social\ninsects, such as ant colonies\
    \ and bee swarms, or bird ﬂocks [6,9,27]. These algorithms\nmimic the decentralized\
    \ decision making and self-organization observed in nature, where\nindividual\
    \ agents interact locally with their environment and with each other to achieve\
    \ a\ncollective goal [27].\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n14 of 28\

    \ Algorithms (PIAs) \nIn general, PIAs draw inspiration from physical principles\
    \ and phenomena to solve \ncomplex problems. These algorithms attempt to replicate\
    \ or mimic physical processes or \nbehaviors to develop efficient and effective\
    \ problem-solving strategies. By harnessing the \nprinciples observed in the physical\

    \ structure and functionality of biological neural \nnetworks, such as the human\
    \ brain. In general, they are computational models composed \nof interconnected\
    \ artificial neurons, which process and transmit information to perform \ntasks\

    \ E.g., \nfeedforward neural networks perceptron con olutional neural networks\n\
    Figure 8. Taxonomy of bio-inspired algorithms.\nSIAs have found applications in\
    \ various ﬁelds, including optimization, robotics, data\nclustering, and IoT.\
    \ In the context of IoT, SIAs can be leveraged to address several challenges\n\
    related to scalability, adaptability, and fault tolerance. These algorithms enable\
    \ IoT devices\nto cooperate and coordinate their actions to perform complex tasks\
    \ and solve problems\nefﬁciently [6,27,48–50]. One popular swarm intelligence\
    \ algorithm used in IoT is Ant\nColony Optimization (ACO). ACO is inspired by\
    \ the foraging behavior of ants and has\nbeen applied to solve optimization problems\
    \ in IoT networks. ACO works by simulating\nthe behavior of ants searching for\
    \ the shortest path between their colony and a food source.\nBiomimetics 2023,\
    \ 8, 373\n15 of 29\nThe pheromone trails left by ants guide the other ants in\
    \ their search, gradually converging\ntoward the optimal solution [27,48–50].\
    \ In the context of IoT, ACO can be used to optimize\nrouting paths, resource\
    \ allocation, or energy management in a network of interconnected\ndevices [48–50].\
    \ Another swarm intelligence algorithm is Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO),\
    \ which is inspired by the ﬂocking behavior of birds, where each individual (particle)\n\
    adjusts its position and velocity based on its own experience and the experience\
    \ of the\nbest-performing particle in the swarm. PSO has been successfully applied\
    \ to various IoT\napplications, including dynamic task scheduling, load balancing,\
    \ and sensor placement\noptimization. These are just a few examples of swarm intelligence\
    \ algorithms used in the\nconstruction of IoT solutions. Other swarm intelligence\
    \ algorithms like Genetic Algorithms\n(GAs), Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO),\
    \ and the Fireﬂy Algorithm (FA) have also\nbeen explored in the context of IoT\
    \ [27,48–50].\n6.\nIn addition to the bio-inspired algorithms mentioned earlier,\
    \ there are several other\nnotable bio-inspired algorithms. Here are a few more\
    \ examples:\nA.\nBat Algorithm (BA)\nThe BA takes inspiration from the echolocation\
    \ behavior of bats. It simulates\nthe movement and interaction of bats to search\
    \ for optimal solutions. Bats\nemit ultrasonic sounds and use the echo to detect\
    \ objects and navigate their\nenvironment. The algorithm incorporates this behavior\
    \ to optimize problem\nsolutions [27,48–50].\nB.\nCuckoo Search (CS)\nThe CS algorithm\
    \ is inspired by the brood parasitism behavior of cuckoos.\nCuckoos lay their\
    \ eggs in the nests of other bird species, and the algorithm\nmimics this behavior\
    \ to optimize solutions. It uses random walk and Lévy\nﬂights to explore the search\
    \ space and replace poor solutions with better\nones [27,48–50].\nC.\nBee Algorithm\
    \ (BA)\nThe BA is inspired by the foraging behavior of honeybees. It mimics the\n\
    process of food source exploration and exploitation by a bee colony to solve\n\
    optimization problems [27,48–50]. The algorithm employs employed bees,\nonlooker\
    \ bees, and scout bees to search for high-quality solutions.\nD.\nGrey Wolf Optimizer\
    \ (GWO)\nThe GWO is inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey\n\
    wolves. It imitates the leadership and cooperation of wolf packs to optimize\n\
    solutions. The algorithm deﬁnes four types of wolves (alpha, beta, delta, and\n\
    omega) and simulates their search for prey to ﬁnd optimal solutions [27].\nE.\n\
    Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA)\nThe DEA is inspired by the echolocation\
    \ behavior of dolphins. It mimics\nthe use of sound waves and echoes for navigation\
    \ and prey detection. The\nalgorithm employs the concept of wavefronts and sonar\
    \ sensing to optimize\nproblem solutions [27].\nAccording to our analysis, bio-inspired\
    \ IoT algorithms offer several advantages over\ntraditional algorithms when it\
    \ comes to solving complex problems pertaining to IoT sys-\ntems. The following\
    \ describes the beneﬁts of these bio-inspired IoT algorithms:\n1.\nAdaptability\n\
    Bio-inspired algorithms are inherently adaptable and can dynamically adjust to\
    \ chang-\ning conditions. They draw inspiration from biological systems that exhibit\
    \ adaptability\nand can handle uncertainties and ﬂuctuations effectively [23–25].\
    \ This adaptability allows\nbio-inspired IoT algorithms to respond to varying\
    \ network conditions, resource availability,\nor environmental changes, resulting\
    \ in improved system performance.\n2.\nScalability\nBiomimetics 2023, 8, 373\n\
    16 of 29\nBio-inspired algorithms, such as swarm intelligence, are well-suited\
    \ for large-scale\nIoT systems [27]. They enable devices to interact and cooperate\
    \ locally, leading to self-\norganization and decentralized decision making. This\
    \ scalability feature allows bio-inspired\nIoT algorithms to efﬁciently handle\
    \ a growing number of devices, interactions, and data in\ncomplex IoT networks.\n\
    3.\nOptimization and efﬁciency\nBio-inspired algorithms excel at optimization\
    \ tasks, resource allocation, and decision\nmaking. By mimicking natural processes\
    \ like genetic evolution or ant colony foraging be-\nhavior, bio-inspired IoT\
    \ algorithms can optimize routing, scheduling, energy management,\nand other resource-intensive\
    \ tasks [48–52]. This optimization leads to improved efﬁciency,\nreduced energy\
    \ consumption, and enhanced system performance [53–57].\n4.\nRobustness and resilience\n\
    Bio-inspired IoT algorithms often exhibit robustness and resilience similar to\
    \ biological\nsystems. They can handle failures, disruptions, or changes in the\
    \ system, thanks to their\ndecentralized and self-organizing nature. This resilience\
    \ helps bio-inspired IoT systems\nmaintain functionality and adapt to evolving\
    \ conditions, making them more reliable in\ndynamic and uncertain environments\
    \ [48–52,58–62].\n5.\nDistributed intelligence\nBio-inspired IoT algorithms enable\
    \ distributed intelligence and decision making. In-\nstead of relying on a centralized\
    \ authority, devices in bio-inspired IoT systems interact\nlocally and collectively\
    \ contribute to the decision-making process. This distributed intelli-\ngence\
    \ enhances fault tolerance, autonomy, and scalability while reducing dependence\
    \ on a\nsingle point of failure [48–52,63–65].\n6.\nSustainability and energy\
    \ efﬁciency\nBio-inspired algorithms often prioritize energy efﬁciency and resource\
    \ optimization,\naligning with sustainability goals. They leverage energy-efﬁcient\
    \ behaviors observed in\nbiological systems, helping reduce energy consumption\
    \ and environmental impact in IoT\ndeployments [6,13–16,64–68].\nOverall, bio-inspired\
    \ IoT algorithms offer a new approach to developing efﬁcient and\nadaptive algorithms\
    \ for IoT systems. As this ﬁeld continues to grow, we can expect to see\nmore\
    \ innovative and efﬁcient algorithms that are inspired by nature.\n4. A Summarization\

    \ IoT offers varying beneﬁts as opposed to traditional IoT, it also\nfaces certain\
    \ challenges. The following describes key challenges pertaining to bio-inspired\n\
    IoT as we have noted through the state of the art.\n1.\nComplexity and scalability\n\
    Bio-inspired algorithms often involve complex interactions and computations, espe-\n\
    cially when simulating swarm intelligence or evolutionary processes. Scaling up\
    \ these\nalgorithms to handle large-scale IoT systems with a massive number of\
    \ devices and data\npoints can be a challenging task. Thus, efﬁciently managing\
    \ the complexity and ensuring\nthe scalability of bio-inspired IoT solutions require\
    \ careful design and optimization [34–36].\n2.\nResource constraint nature\nIoT\
    \ devices are typically resource-constrained in terms of computational power,\
    \ mem-\nory, energy, and bandwidth [32]. Bio-inspired algorithms, especially those\
    \ involving\ncomplex computations or large populations, can impose signiﬁcant\
    \ resource demands\non IoT devices. Thus, designing bio-inspired IoT solutions\
    \ that are efﬁcient in terms\nof computational requirements and resource usage\
    \ becomes crucial to overcome these\nconstraints [32,34–36].\n3.\nAdaptability\
    \ and robustness\nBio-inspired algorithms are known for their adaptability and\
    \ robustness. However,\nadapting these algorithms to dynamic and evolving IoT\
    \ environments poses challenges.\nIoT systems experience changes in device availability,\
    \ network conditions, and data char-\nacteristics, requiring bio-inspired IoT\
    \ solutions to be resilient and adaptive to such varia-\ntions [27,35,49].\nBiomimetics\
    \ 2023, 8, 373\n24 of 29\n4.\nSecurity and privacy\nIn general, IoT systems raise\
    \ concerns about security and privacy, and bio-inspired\nIoT is no exception.\
    \ The interconnected nature of IoT devices and the use of bio-inspired\nalgorithms\
    \ can introduce vulnerabilities, such as attacks on swarm intelligence or genetic\n\
    processes [73]. Thus, ensuring the security and privacy of data, communications,\
    \ and\nalgorithms in bio-inspired IoT is an ongoing challenge that many researchers\
    \ are currently\nworking on [34–36].\n5.\nInteroperability and standardization\n\
    Bio-inspired IoT solutions may involve different devices, protocols, or platforms,\
    \ lead-\ning to interoperability challenges [32–36]. Integrating diverse devices,\
    \ algorithms, and data\nformats can be complex, requiring standardized interfaces\
    \ and protocols for seamless com-\nmunication and collaboration. Hence, developing\
    \ interoperable bio-inspired IoT solutions\nis crucial for their widespread adoption\
    \ and integration into existing IoT ecosystems.\n6.\nEthical and legal considerations\n\
    Bio-inspired IoT solutions may raise ethical and legal concerns, particularly\
    \ when they\ninvolve autonomous decision making, learning from data, or privacy-sensitive\
    \ information.\nAddressing issues related to accountability, fairness, transparency,\
    \ data privacy, and com-\nplying with available policies and regulations is essential\
    \ to ensure responsible deployment\nand use of bio-inspired IoT solutions.\nIn\
    \ summary, addressing all these challenges requires interdisciplinary research,\
    \ collab-\noration, and a holistic approach that considers the technical, computational,\
    \ environmental,\nsocial, and ethical aspects of bio-inspired IoT systems.\n6.\
    \ Current Status and Future Directions\nBio-inspired IoT aims to address various\
    \ challenges in traditional IoT systems, such\nas scalability, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ adaptability, and fault tolerance. Drawing inspiration\nfrom biological systems,\
    \ it aids in designing IoT systems that can self-organize, self-heal,\nand adapt\
    \ to changing environments. As of now, according to the latest statistics, there\n\
    are around 16 billion IoT devices, a number which is expected to double by 2030\
    \ [29–31].\nOn the other hand, the market size was valued at nearly USD 600 billion\
    \ in 2022, and it\nis expected to reach more than USD 3000 billion in 2030 [29–31].\
    \ Thus, being a rapidly\ngrowing technological ecosystem, it is expected that\
    \ the challenges that IoT may encounter\nmay also grow in the long run. Hence\
    \ even though the research in terms of bio-inspired IoT\nis still at an early\
    \ stage, it is expected that it will also continue to grow toward designing\n\
    robust, safe, and resilient IoT solutions in the long run [74,75]. According to\
    \ our review,\nit is evident that the integration of bio-inspired solutions with\
    \ the IoT holds tremendous\npotential for shaping the future of technology and\
    \ determining the future of the human\nrace, enabling us to overcome whatever\
    \ challenges we encounter. Such bio-inspired IoT\nsolutions would continue to\
    \ grow in the long run, and in this regard, anticipated future\ndirections of\
    \ bio-inspired IoT are highlighted in the following for better understanding.\n\
    1.\nHybrid approaches\nThe integration of bio-inspired algorithms with other computational\
    \ techniques, such\nas machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics, can\
    \ enhance the capabilities of\nbio-inspired IoT [63,64,73–78]. Hybrid approaches\
    \ that combine the strengths of different\nalgorithms and methodologies are likely\
    \ to emerge, enabling more powerful and adaptable\nsolutions [74,75,79].\n2.\n\
    Integration with edge computing/fog computing\nWith the growing emphasis on edge\
    \ /fog computing in IoT, bio-inspired algorithms\ncan be leveraged at the edge\
    \ to enable intelligent decision making and resource optimiza-\ntion [30–34].\
    \ Bio-inspired edge intelligence can lead to more autonomous, energy-efﬁcient,\n\
    Biomimetics 2023, 8, 373\n25 of 29\nand responsive IoT systems that process data\
    \ and make decisions locally, reducing latency\nand bandwidth requirements.\n\
    3.\nExplainability and interpretability\nAs bio-inspired IoT systems become more\
    \ complex and autonomous, the need for\nexplainable and interpretable models and\
    \ algorithms becomes critical. Research focusing on\nunderstanding and interpreting\
    \ the decision-making processes of bio-inspired algorithms\ncan lead to more trustworthy\
    \ and transparent IoT systems, enabling users to comprehend\nand validate the\
    \ outputs and behavior of such systems [48–50,73–75].\n4.\nCollaborative and cooperative\
    \ bio-inspired IoT systems\nExploring the collective behavior and cooperation\
    \ among multiple bio-inspired IoT\nsystems can lead to innovative solutions [76,77].\
    \ Research on collaborative algorithms,\ncoordination mechanisms, and collective\
    \ decision making can enable IoT systems to work\ntogether as intelligent collectives,\
    \ sharing information and optimizing tasks in a cooperative\nmanner [73].\n5.\n\
    Ethical and social considerations\nAs bio-inspired IoT becomes more integrated\
    \ into various aspects of daily life, ad-\ndressing ethical and social implications\
    \ is crucial. Hence, future research should focus on\nunderstanding and addressing\
    \ issues related to bias, fairness, accountability, transparency,\nand the social\
    \ impact of bio-inspired IoT systems [49,73–75].\n7. Conclusions\nWith the emergence\
    \ of bio-inspired IoT, researchers have been able to develop creative\nsolutions\
    \ to handle the complex issues faced by IoT deployments by pulling inspiration\n\
    from biological systems such as diverse ecosystems and swarms. In the study, we\
    \ have car-\nried out a review of what is meant by bio-inspiration, how bio-inspired\
    \ IoT can overcome\nthe challenges associated with traditional IoT, bio-inspired\
    \ solutions, and the ecosystem\nof bio-inspired IoT, highlighting challenges and\
    \ future directions. With the review per-\nformed, it is evident that bio-inspired\
    \ IoT has shown exceptional ﬂexibility and robustness\nin various domains where\
    \ traditional IoT solutions are not capable of delivering such\nbeneﬁts. According\
    \ to the state of the art, researchers have suggested decentralized and au-\n\
    tonomous designs for IoT networks based on the self-organizing and self-healing\
    \ qualities\nof natural systems, allowing them to dynamically adapt to changing\
    \ conditions, reorganize\nthemselves, and recover from failures. These bio-inspired\
    \ techniques have the potential to\nprovide extremely scalable and durable IoT\
    \ systems that can survive disturbances while\nmaintaining consistent connections.\
    \ Nonetheless, it is also evident that the bio-inspired\nIoT paradigm has considerable\
    \ environmental advantages where researchers have created\nenergy-efﬁcient communication\
    \ protocols, low-power sensor networks, and intelligent\ndata-processing approaches\
    \ by mimicking nature’s efﬁciency and sustainability. These\ndevelopments not\
    \ only reduce the carbon footprint of IoT installations but also allow\nIoT technologies\
    \ to be integrated into environmentally benign applications such as smart\nagriculture,\
    \ wildlife monitoring, and smart cities. However, while bio-inspired IoT systems\n\
    have enormous promise, there are several difﬁculties and prospects for further\
    \ study. The\nscalability and security of these systems continue to be signiﬁcant\
    \ challenges, similar to\ntraditional IoT solutions, necessitating more research\
    \ in the area. On the other hand, ethical\nproblems, privacy concerns, and the\
    \ responsible use of data must all be properly addressed\nfor bio-inspired IoT\
    \ to be a stable technology, which researchers are currently working\non. In conclusion,\
    \ bio-inspired IoT solutions will surely play a critical part in deﬁning the\n\
    next generation of smart and pervasive solutions enhancing the power of the biological\n\
    world, ushering us into a more efﬁcient, robust, and harmonious future as we continue\
    \ to\ninvestigate the synergy between nature and technology.\nBiomimetics 2023,\

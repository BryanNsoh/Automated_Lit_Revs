- analysis: 'The paper contributes to understanding how to most efficiently and securely
    transfer sensitive healthcare data to the cloud for storage and analysis. The
    paper specifically addresses the importance of data sanitization, restoration,
    and the choice of appropriate encryption keys. The paper introduces a new algorithm,
    BFL-PSO, which optimizes both encryption efficiency and data privacy. The authors
    claim that their approach provides superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
    algorithms in terms of cost, delay time, encryption time, error rate, and convergence
    speed, all of which are important considerations for real-time healthcare applications.


    The paper presents the following three key quotes relevant to the point of the
    analysis:


    * "We present data sanitization and restoration processes to generate the keys
    from the acquired data and develop a multi-objective function for the hiding ratio,
    degree of modification, and information preservation ratio. We then employed the
    Bee-Foraging Learning-based Particle Swarm Optimization (BFL-PSO) algorithm to
    acquire the optimal key while transferring healthcare data into the cloud to ensure
    high security."

    * "The experiment is carried out on the UHDDS dataset. The performance is assessed
    in terms of Security, delay time, encryption time, error rate, and convergence
    speed, with the results contrasted to state-of-the-art works. The performance
    study demonstrates that the suggested algorithm has higher Security than cutting-edge
    security algorithms."

    * "We present a novel multi-objective-based healthcare data transmission in the
    cloud environment based on the BFL-PSO algorithm to meet the security requirements
    and solve the trade-off problem."


    While the paper provides a detailed description of the proposed approach and its
    performance evaluation, some limitations should be noted:


    * The evaluation is based on a single dataset (UHDDS), which may not be representative
    of all healthcare data scenarios. Future work could involve evaluating the approach
    on a wider range of datasets, including those with different sizes, structures,
    and data types.

    * The paper does not provide a theoretical analysis of the security or privacy
    guarantees provided by the proposed approach. Future work could explore this aspect
    in more depth to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the approach''s
    security and privacy implications.

    * The paper does not compare the proposed approach to other recent advances in
    healthcare data security, such as homomorphic encryption or federated learning.
    Future work could include a more comprehensive comparison of the proposed approach
    to these other techniques.


    Despite these limitations, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field
    of healthcare data security and offers a promising new approach for optimizing
    the efficiency and security of healthcare data transfer to the cloud.'

    Abstract: Cloud computing is a potential platform transforming the health sector
    by allowing clinicians to monitor patients in real-time using sensor technologies.
    However, the users tend to transmit sensitive and classified medical data back

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Cloud computing offers distributed
    database, networking, storage, data analysis, and Internet of Things (IoT) services
    to various stakeholders, enabling them to be more flexible, faster, and financially
    benefiting from cheap operating, maintenance, and service costs [1]. The cloud
    distributes storage and processing among servers and edge devices that provide
    self-services, enabling end users and stakeholders to receive ubiquitous and timely
    responses [2]. The cloud infrastructure is divided into three categories: private,
    public, and hybrid services, depending on the service being provided and the requirements
    of the customers [3]. The remote cloud configuration is for an organization hosting
    data within its own data center, where the organization is responsible for managing
    all cloud resources owned [4]. Since that infrastructure owns its private resources
    with limited organization-owned transactions, it provides enhanced security compared
    to public and hybrid cloud infrastructures. Albeit using a private cloud solution
    offers organizations better Security and control over their servers, it does necessitate
    a considerably higher level of IT experience than utilizing a public cloud. The
    public cloud setup is available to all externally registered companies over the
    internet, with the option to use the resources on a pay-per-use basis [5]. Given
    the shared communication channel, the public cloud is less secure but less expensive
    than the private cloud arrangement. The cloud infrastructure is controlled and
    maintained by a large Cloud Service Provider (CSP), responsible for establishing
    and encouraging the general public cloud and its IT resources. The hybrid cloud
    concept arose from the blurred distinctions between traditional private and public
    clouds, defined by location, ownership, and organizational requirements [5]. The
    hybrid cloud configuration combines the benefits of private and public clouds.
    The environment shares critical and non-critical information with the private
    and public infrastructure to ensure the appropriate Security while cutting resource
    management expertise and equipment costs [6]. These clouds empower their customers
    with infrastructure as a service (Iaas), platform as a service (Paas), and software
    as a service (SaaS) services that are hosted by outside providers and allowed
    access to consumers online [7]. The IaaS provides computing, networking, and data
    storage capabilities; PaaS offers a programming environment for users to develop
    code and run applications; and SaaS enables customers to run software that demands
    high processing over distant servers [8]. Besides the organization’s distinctive
    requirements, the standard assessment metrics of cloud infrastructure are Security,
    cost, flexibility, service latency, responsiveness, encryption and decryption
    times, convergence speed, control over infrastructures, and complexity [9]. The
    healthcare sector is currently facing various financial challenges, such as managing
    multiple stakeholders for service delivery and an older population; nevertheless,
    medical informatics organizations may appreciate the benefits of the cloud paradigm
    for transmitting data and applications [10]. Cloud computing has the potential
    to address these challenges because medical data administration and analysis are
    expensive, and there are few appropriate software solutions [11]; consequently,
    cloud-based applications can bring solutions to the current problems confronting
    the healthcare sector [12]. However, even with the anticipated improvements, the
    rate of acceptance and efficient application of cloud computing within the healthcare
    industry still needs to improve. For instance, the retail industry has a 57% adoption
    rate of cloud computing, but the healthcare sector has a 31% adoption rate [13].
    Security is one of the most significant barriers to adopting cloud computing within
    the healthcare system, influencing data integration, interoperability, real-time
    patient monitoring, and decision-making sharing among different healthcare physicians
    [14]. The cloud provides real-time patient monitoring, and clinicians frequently
    send sensitive health monitoring and classified medical data back and forth to
    cloud service providers resulting in a convoluted and insecure system that leads
    to a trade-off between computing complexity and security [15]. In this work, we
    presented a novel multi-objective-based healthcare data transmission in the cloud
    environment based on the BFL-PSO algorithm to meet the security requirements and
    solve the trade-off problem. The main three-fold contribution of this work is
    listed below. We investigated the data sanitization and restoration process to
    generate the keys and devised a multi-objective function for the hiding ratio,
    degree of modification, and information preservation ratio in conjunction with
    an optimization algorithm to determine the optimal key for patient’s real-time
    monitoring and doctor’s interchange of sensitive medical data back and forth to
    the cloud system. We addressed the multi-objective function by employing the Bee-Foraging
    Learning-based Particle Swarm Optimization (BFL-PSO) algorithm, which learns the
    hiding ratio, degree of modification, and information preservation ratio for the
    acquisition of the optimal key that ensures high Security for the transferring
    the healthcare data into the cloud system. We evaluated the suggested BFL-PSO
    algorithm against the cutting-edge Euclidean L3P-based Multi-Objective Successive
    Approximation (EMSA) [16], Shark Smell Optimization (J-SSO) [17], Improved Multi-Objective
    Particle Swarm Optimization (IMPSO) [18]. Hashed Needham Schroeder (HNS) Cost
    Optimized Deep Machine Learning (HNS-CODML) [19] security algorithms in terms
    of Security, delay time, encryption time, error rate, and convergence speed utilizing
    the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data set (UHDDS) [20] dataset. The remainder of
    the work is organized as follows: Section II assesses the relevant results, and
    their benefits and drawbacks are enumerated. The system model of the proposed
    bee-foraging learning-based particle swarm optimization algorithm is demonstrated
    in Section III. the proposed BFL-PSO approach for the secured healthcare data
    in the cloud environment, as well as the multi-objective parameters, are discussed
    in Section IV. The findings and comparison study are discussed in Section V, and
    finally, Section VI concludes the work. SECTION II. Literature Survey A Euclidean
    L3P-based Multi-Objective Successive Approximation (EMSA) algorithm is proposed
    by Sathya et al. [15] to conserve eHealth data, including the classification of
    health information into private and public categories. They encrypted sensitive
    information with an encryption key and retained the significant source of the
    encrypted keys. They assessed the proposed EMSA using the usefulness, fitness,
    and privacy parameters. Their findings revealed improved privacy for relatively
    large datasets, but they didn’t consider the avoidance of all potential assaults.
    Ahamad et al. [16] developed a Jaya-based Shark Smell Optimization (J-SSO) algorithm
    for the cloud sector, utilizing a two-step data restoration and sanitization approach
    to achieve optimal results. The parameters acquired from the optimum key are employed
    to verify health data security. The suggested model exhibited its potential to
    solve problems quickly and yield significant results; nevertheless, a sluggish
    convergence rate with low accuracy was observed. Consequently, an optimum output
    with a high convergence rate and accuracy have yet to be developed. Devaraj et
    al. [17] have described the Firefly (FF) algorithm and the Improved Multi-Objective
    Particle Swarm Optimization (IMPSO) technique to reduce the search space for improving
    the acquisition of the optimum key. The search space is optimized, and the global
    best solution is chosen by locating a point and computing the distance to the
    optimal solution. The response time and resource usage are increased to facilitate
    effective selection, which results in data duplication. Alzubi et al. [18] proposed
    the Hashed Needham Schroeder (HNS) Cost Optimized Deep Machine Learning (HNS-CODML)
    approach for secure data transmission. Their work derives the number of transitions
    and states from the classical Finite State Automata network model and employs
    Finite State Automata (FSA). The execution time, communication overhead, and cost
    estimate the model’s effectiveness; however, security measures are not considered.
    Rani et al. [20] adopted Hybrid Teaching and Learning Based Optimization (HTLBO)
    to solve encryption key optimization problems. The block cipher recognizes healthcare
    data encrypted by the network’s IoT sensors. The number of users generates ciphertext
    data utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), and the privacy and accuracy
    optimization is strengthened for the number of communicating users; moreover,
    the practical application of the work still needs to be addressed. A Preferred
    Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) technique has
    been proposed by Shukla et al. [21] to lower the latency of cloud and IoT. They
    exploited fog computing to reduce packet errors and identify the best path for
    the packets. They furthermore investigated the clustering mechanism to determine
    latency. As a result, their technique is highly efficient, albeit the emphasis
    was on latency rather than other security considerations. Tamilarasi and Jawahar
    [22] introduced a novel hybrid lightweight encryption scheme employing a swarm
    optimization algorithm (HLE-SO). The lightweight features integrate HLE-SO with
    pallier encryption, which reduces the number of iterations required by the key
    space modifications algorithm. Furthermore, the approach encrypts the data and
    sends it to the end-user while considering encryption and decryption metrics while
    evaluating the suggested algorithm. As a result, the proposed method lowered error
    and processing time while boosting encryption time. Anand et al. [23] have developed
    compression-then-encryption-based dual watermarking for healthcare to preserve
    Electronic Patient Records. The watermark is incorporated in the wavelet coefficient
    for data transmission in Electronic Patient Records. The redundant discrete wavelet
    transform (RDWT) covers the image, allowing it to be transferred effectively over
    the network. However, real-time implementation is challenging and results in significant
    complexity. Mousavi and Ghaffari [24] present a novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
    approach to secure irrigation systems by using Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC)
    to generate private keys. The suggested study employs the D-dimensional space
    to determine the most suitable solution. Both the private and public keys are
    used to securely transmit data over the communication channel by storing the user’s
    information. However, the mechanism for generating secure private keys needs to
    be researched, and therefore algorithms for private key generation are desired.
    The cloud’s Security can be gained by virtualized IP, data protection, controls,
    and policies; yet, it also has some shortcomings, such as data loss, loss of control
    and procedures, complexities, and more. To improve security in transmitting healthcare
    data in the cloud environment, resolving these problems is vital. Table 1 lists
    the limitations and benefits of prior works. TABLE 1 A summary of the limitations
    of the previous algorithms concerning the cloud security measure in the healthcare
    system SECTION III. System Model of the Proposed Bee-Foraging Learning-Based Particle
    Swarm Optimization Algorithm Although cloud computing is a rapidly expanding technology,
    Security is one of the biggest worries since it must adhere to stringent security
    protocols for sensitive data like patient monitoring and hospital records. Therefore,
    the cloud system should ensure the safe transmission and receipt of sensitive
    data for patient monitoring and healthcare professionals. Moreover, the cloud
    grants access permission to a subset of users, reflecting a lack of data processing
    for all users in the cloud environment; to address the access permission issue,
    the cloud also supports the data sharing mechanism; nevertheless, this leads to
    the data breach problem. The cloud must establish a strong cyber security layer
    to ensure the cloud system’s Security for both patient monitoring data and healthcare
    professional data. Therefore, the proposed work employs data sanitization and
    restoration techniques to construct secure keys for data transfer before utilizing
    the BFL-PSO to optimally determine the most suitable keys that enhance the security
    level for healthcare data, as shown in Fig. 1. The figure shows how healthcare
    data is encased using a two-step sanitization and restoration technique, with
    the former allowing the concealment of sensitive monitoring and other confidential
    data, preventing data breaches by unauthorized users. Subsequently, it leverages
    the BFL-PSO algorithm to resolve the multi-objective function and learn the encased
    ratio, degree of modification, and information preservation ratio to acquire the
    optimal key that guarantees high Security for transmitting medical data into a
    cloud system. The latter mechanism then decrypts the data using optimally chosen
    keys for the authorized users, consequently heightening Security and processing
    through a two-step sanitization, restoration, and optimization algorithm. FIGURE
    1. Illustration of the system model of the proposed BFL-PSO approach for enhancing
    Security in cloud systems for healthcare data. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed BFL-PSO
    Approach for the Secured Healthcare Data in the Cloud Environment This Section
    delves into the mechanism of the proposed multi-objective function for the cloud-based
    healthcare system, which employs data sanitization, restoration, and the BFL-PSO
    algorithms to encapsulate data, pick optimal keys, and restore data for authorized
    users. A. The Uniform Hospital Discharge Dataset The Uniform Hospital Discharge
    Dataset (UHDDS) [25] was utilized to investigate the cloud environment’s security
    through the sanitization and restoration process for the data-encased and restoration
    processes, as well as for optimum key selection using the suggested BFL-PSO algorithm.
    The UHDDS was a project of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the
    forerunner of today’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and it offered
    patients access to their treatment data, including information on their Medicare
    and Medicaid coverage. Additionally, it provides sensitive information regarding
    the inpatient’s symptoms and reports on the primary treatment procedure, both
    before and after the diagnosis. B. The Sanitization and Restoration Mechanisms
    for Data Encasing and Restoring The generation of a key matrix commences with
    binary data conversion in the cloud system, followed by the XOR operation to sanitize
    [26] the binary data that was transformed from the healthcare dataset, as depicted
    in the schematic diagram in Fig. 2. Meanwhile, the suggested BFL-PSO selects the
    best key among the generated keys, ensuring high Security and preventing unauthorized
    users from accessing the sanitized data. Next, the generated key and the cloud
    data are converted into binary form, and its total binary number is converted
    into decimal form for further processing. Following that, Eq. (1) is used to perform
    the XOR operation, which leads to the generation of sanitized data from the original
    data in addition to the generated key matrix data. This mechanism conceals sensitive
    data, enhancing the Security of the cloud system and offering data protection.
    The same XOR process is employed in the data restoration mechanism for permitted
    access, which utilizes the duplicate keys on the encrypted data to reinstate the
    encapsulated sensitive data, as shown in Eq. (2). F s ′ F s ∼ =Fs⊕K2 =F s ′ ⊕K2
    (1) (2) View Source The original data from the cloud is denoted as Fs, and after
    sanitization, the data is represented Fs’, with the key generated after the optimization
    process labeled as K2. Likewise, the restored data is indicated as F s ∼ at the
    restoration end. FIGURE 2. The data conversion and the sanitization and restoration
    processes for the generation of keys and optimal key selection through the proposed
    BFL-PSO approach. Show All C. The Key Generation Mechanism Once the pool of keys
    has been generated using the sanitization as mentioned above and the restoration
    mechanism, the suggested BFL-PSO algorithm is employed to determine an optimal
    key that ensures the highest level of Security. The key generation process entails
    the transformation into a new framework utilizing the Kronecker technique. Following
    that, the Kth key converts to the K1 matrix with a size of W − − √ × R max , for
    instance, when the Kth key size is K={6,8,1} the resultant K1 matrix can be retrieved
    as shown in Eq. (3). K1= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 6 8 1 6 8 1 6 8 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ W √ × R max (3) View Source
    The total number of records transacted is represented by W , which results in
    key duplication, as demonstrated by the rows in Eq. (3), necessitating a mechanism
    for determining the optimal keys. To derive the optimal key denoted by K2 from
    a population of keys with duplication, we utilize the BFL-PSO algorithm, as detailed
    in the subsequent section. Lemma 1:If ( K r ) ∞ r=1 is an infinite series of real
    integers that conforms to ∑ ∞ w=1 K w =s If something exists and is limited, then
    we have all got to 0< b 1 ≤ b 2 ≤ b 3 ≤…..and b r →∞ that lim r→∞ 1 b n ∑ n=1
    r b n K w =0 View Source Proof:Let L n indicate the important partial amounts.
    Summarizing using components lim r→∞ 1 b n ∑ n=1 r b n K w = L K − lim r→∞ 1 b
    n ∑ n=1 r ( b n+1 − b n ) L n View Source Select any ε>0 . Select N now so that
    it L n is near s for k > N. This can be done as the series L n approaches s .
    The right half is then: = L K − 1 b k ∑ n=1 N−1 ( b n+1 − b n ) L n − 1 b k ∑
    n=N k−1 ( b n+1 − b k ) L n L K − 1 b k ∑ n=1 N−1 ( b n+1 − b n ) L n − b k −
    b N b k s− 1 b k ∑ n=N k−1 ( b n+1 − b k )( L n −s) View Source Let n now extend
    to infinite. s receives the first term, and the third term wipes it out. The second
    component equals “0” (as the sum is a fixed value). The final component is limited
    by ∈( b k − b N )/ b k ≤∈ because the b sequence is growing. D. The Bee-Foraging
    Learning (BFL) Model Since the suggested optimization algorithm is based on the
    bee-foraging learning model, we investigate it by employing the ABC division-of-labor
    approaches outlined in [27]. The model is composed of three main stages: employed
    learning, onlooker learning, and scout learning with the personal location designated
    by P b , velocity V i , and own location L i portrayed through the particle N
    initialization procedure. 1) Employed Learning The employed learning level demonstrates
    the behavior of particle swarm optimization as employee bees in the ABC algorithm,
    with the location and velocities of each particle updated depending on the Learning
    of personal and global ideal locations denoted by P b and G b , respectively.
    The following Eq. (4) is used to accomplish the modifications. { V new i = L new
    i = l( V old i , L old i , P bi , G b ) L old i + V new i (4) View Source where
    the variables L old i and V old i represent the location and velocity of the previous
    iteration, and the variables L new i and V new i are the updated or new location,
    and the velocity, with l being the upgrading velocity factor that replaces the
    local location L new i , instead of the global location G b . Moreover, the remaining
    particles are updated by incrementing the counter variable as CN(i)=CN(i)+1 ,
    which leads to the best position and the reset operation denoted with CN(i)=0
    . 2) Learning of Onlooker Taking into account the onlooker bees mentioned in ABC
    [28], the particle with the best fitness values is sought in this onlooker stage;
    consequently, the best fitness value of each particle F b i is determined employing
    Eq. (5) and the probability of the i th particle P i being chosen can be computed
    according to Eq. (6). Fit( L i ) P i ={ 1 1+ F b i 1+| F b i | F b i ≥0 otherwise
    = Fit( L i ) ∑ M i=1 Fit( L i ) (5) (6) View Source The roulette technique identifies
    particles based on P i values so that the particle with the largest value with
    the highest P b value is regarded as the optimal value. For instance, considering
    the j th chosen particle, the new location L new j based on the P b value can
    be estimated and then compared to the same value; if the value is higher than
    the P b , the estimated L new j value is substituted. Then, again, the remaining
    particles are updated by incrementing the j th counter variable as CN(j)=CN(j)+1
    that leads to the best position and the reset operation denoted with CN(j)=0 .
    3) Scout Learning The scout learning stage recognizes particles that fail to update
    their P b value as exhausted until a certain number of iterations, with the positions,
    velocity, and P b values becoming randomly re-initialized when the particles are
    evicted from the search space. E. The Proposed Bee-Foraging Learning Enabled Particle
    Swarm Optimization Algorithm The BFL-PSO technique may be used to tackle various
    optimization problems by optimizing system parameters using the BFL model as a
    foundation. Therefore, the proposed BFL-PSO algorithm employs the BFL model in
    conjunction with the concept of biogeography-based Learning PSO to upgrade the
    velocity and location through generated Eq. (7). { V new i = L new i = λ×A.random(
    P b ε i − l old i ) L old i + V new i (7) View Source The inertia weight λ and
    learning factor A are crucial variables in the particle swarm optimization process.
    The inertia weight regulates the behavior of the particles in the swarm, enabling
    them to explore more of the search area. In contrast, the learning factor regulates
    the rate at which the particles update their velocities and locations, enabling
    them to converge on a solution swiftly. The optimization method may be modified
    to find better solutions in less time by modifying the values of these parameters.
    In this instance, λ is the inertia weight supplied in the range [0, 1], and A
    is the learning factor, a uniformly distributed random vector for values in the
    [0, 1] range. Finally, the total of all the particles’ personal best placements
    is found, which is represented by P b ε i . Figure 3 depicts the algorithm flowchart
    of the proposed BPLF-PSO, performing the following main steps. Initialization:
    Initialize the particles’ positions, velocities V i and personal best p best placements
    L i with random values. Estimate the particles using Eq. (5) and store the G best
    position. While the criteria are not met, Apply employed Learning. Movement: Move
    the particles according to the velocity vector and update the personal best placements
    using Eq. (7). Evaluation: Evaluate the fitness of the current positions and compare
    them with the personal best placements. If the new position is better than the
    old placements, then p best = L new i otherwise, the remaining particles are updated
    with incremental the counter variable as CN(i)=CN(i)+1 that lead to the best position
    and the reset operation denoted with CN(i)=0 . Replacement: Replace the personal
    best placements with the better fitness value using the Learning of onlooker from
    Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) and continue the process similar from the previous steps till
    the optimal solution. Consequently, the Learning of scout is estimated and updated
    to the best solution. total: Calculate the total of all the particle’s personal
    best placements from employed, onlooker, and scout learning of all stages. Termination:
    Terminate the algorithm if the total of all the particles’ personal best placements
    is equal to P b ε i . FIGURE 3. The flowchart of the proposed bee-foraging Learning

    of the particle’s globally best score. After that, G b i = Δ G b . The trajectory
    of the particle is evaluated by the theory as, lim i→+∞ V i = L 1 = ϕ 1 G b +

    that lim i→+∞ V b,i = ϕ 1 G b + ϕ 1 G b ϵ i ϕ 1 + ϕ 2 = G b ϵ i (9) View Source
    This outcome is immediately applicable to the BFL-PSO’s predictable variant. Furthermore,
    this result can be readily expanded to the stochastic case using Poli’s most recent
    findings because G b i = G b ϵ i . We will now include the other elements in this
    outcome. F. Multi-Objective Model for Our Proposed Cyber Security-Based Cloud
    Storage For the Healthcare Data This Section detailed the multi-objective function
    for the hiding ratio, degree of modification, and information preservation ratio
    using the BFL-PSO algorithm. Our proposed BFL-PSO algorithm fitness function optimizes
    the parameters of these four major objectives for the acquisition of the optimal
    key that ensures high Security for transferring the healthcare data into the cloud
    system. 1) Hiding Ration The ratio of sensitive data to be concealed during the
    sanitization procedure [29] is determined by the hiding ratio, which is described
    by Eq. (10). F D =abs( F 1 − F 2 ) (10) View Source The original data points F
    1 and F 2 are utilized to compute the difference (distance) and is by the index
    F D , where the non-zero F D indices are denoted by M and can be computed using
    Eq (11). H= M I i (11) View Source where H is the hiding ratio, and the total
    number of data indexes is denoted as I i , with better performance with a higher
    value of H and vice versa. 2) Degree of Modification The Euclidean distance between
    the original and sanitized data is used to calculate the degree of modification
    ( Q ), which is expressed as a percentage and computed using Eq. (12). Q=Fs−F
    s ∼ (12) View Source 3) Solution Encoding: The generation of keys is contingent
    on the number of transactions or the size of the data, and the optimization of
    the generated key through the sanitization and restoration mechanism for the optimal
    key with an improved security level is accomplished by incorporating the BFL-PSO
    algorithm. 4) Information Preservation Ratio: Information preservation indicates
    the fraction of non-sensitive data that is encapsulated throughout the sanitization
    process and is defined by the reciprocal value of the information loss, as stated
    in Eq. (13). PI= M TP (13) View Source where TP is the total number of indexes
    that are preserved, where the higher value of PI results in stronger security
    measures and vice versa. 5) Final Objective Function: The final objective function,
    Eq. (14), integrates the hiding ratio, degree of modification, and preservation
    ratio to yield an optimal key from the collection of generated keys. FO=Q+(1−H)+(1−PI)
    (14) View Source Here, Q denotes the degree of modification, H indicates the hiding
    ratio, and PI denotes the information preservation ratio. SECTION V. Experimental
    Analysis In this section, we contrasted the multi-objective optimization-based
    encryption strategy with the diverse cutting-edge security approaches for improving
    the Security of cloud-linked smart healthcare data transmission. A. Performance
    Analysis Table 2 defines patient clinical information, and Table 3 provides several
    parametric descriptions based on health data size, in which parameters such as
    key size, keywords, number of rounds, and percentage of cipher security levels
    vary depending on health data size [30]. The suggested BFL-PSO-based security
    algorithm is assessed in terms of best price or cost and is shown in Fig. 4. The
    figure shows that the suggested algorithm outperforms the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML,
    and IMPSO approaches in terms of cost. Cost comparisons between the EMSA, J-SSO,
    HNS-CODML, IMPSO, and the suggested technique indicate costs of 35, 40, 29, 14,
    and 2 dollars, respectively. As a consequence, the proposed approach offers more
    cost-effective advantages when compared to the other security algorithms. TABLE

    size of health data FIGURE 4. A comparison of the price or best service cost concerning
    the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML, IMPSO, and the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms for healthcare
    data in cloud system. Show All In Fig. 5, we show the Evaluation of service delay
    time to evaluate the suggested technique against the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML, and
    IMPSO approaches. According to the empirical investigation, the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML,
    IMPSO, and suggested approaches took 8.45 sec, 7.43 sec, 11.67 sec, 6.77 sec,
    and 3.2 sec, respectively. FIGURE 5. A comparison of the service delay time in
    seconds with EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML, IMPSO, and the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms
    for healthcare data in cloud system. Show All The suggested approach, however,
    has a shorter service delay time than other current methods, such as EMSA, J-SSO,
    HNS-CODML, and IMPSO. We also took into account various situations, such as with
    and without optimization, and we recorded certain iterations to measure the response
    time, as shown in Fig. 6. The figure shows the response time for each security
    solution when 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 iterations are considered, both with and
    without optimization. It is noticeable that the suggested BFL-based PSO algorithm
    achieves faster convergence than previous meta-heuristic models. Finally, the
    availability of BFL-based PSO optimization findings reduces execution time compared
    to the absence of optimization results [19]. Similarly, we analyzed the encryption
    times for the various techniques to assess the effectiveness of the proposed BFL-PSO
    algorithm and showed the findings in Fig. 7. The data bit size is essential in
    determining the encryption time since it consumes CPU cycles, which influences
    the encryption time. As a result, data bit sizes of 8, 18, 24, and 32 are selected
    for the encryption time evaluation. According to the figure, the suggested approach
    results in encryption times of 1, 5, 10, and 19 seconds for varied data volumes,
    which is significantly shorter than current methods such as EMSA, J-SSO, and HNS-CODML.
    Similarly, the performance in terms of decryption time for varied data sizes and
    results are shown in Fig. 8. The equivalent data bit sizes of 8, 18, 24, and 32
    are used to evaluate the decryption time for each approach. We obtained decryption
    times of 1.5, 4.3, 9.9, and 18.78 seconds using the suggested approach for decrypting
    data of various sizes, and in comparison to current techniques such as EMSA, J-SSO,
    and HNS-CODML, the proposed strategy results in faster decryption. FIGURE 6. A
    comparison of the response time in seconds considering the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms
    for healthcare data in cloud system. Show All FIGURE 7. A comparison of the encryption
    time with varying data sizes according to the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML, and the proposed

    of the decryption time with varying data size according to the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML,
    and the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms for healthcare data in cloud system. Show
    All The suggested algorithm’s convergence speed [31] with the number of iterations
    is also compared to the EMSA, J-SSOM, and HNS-CODML approaches. The findings are
    shown in Fig. 9 for the iterations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 that were taken into
    consideration. In comparison to the cutting-edge security algorithms EMSA, J-SSOM,
    and HNS-CODML approaches, we have seen a faster convergence using the proposed
    algorithm. The suggested BFL state-of-the-art PSO’s computational time [32] is
    contrasted to the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML, and IMPSO algorithms and the result
    is depicted in Figure 10. The figure demonstrates that the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML,
    IMPSO, and suggested approaches offer 12.38, 9.06, 10.34, 18.23, and 2.89 percentages
    of computational time, respectively. The figure shows that the proposed technique
    requires less computing time than the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML, and IMPSO algorithms.
    FIGURE 9. A comparison of the convergence speed with varying number of iterations
    following the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML, and the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms for healthcare
    data in cloud system. Show All FIGURE 10. A comparison of the computational time
    concerning the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML, IMPSO, and the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms
    for healthcare data in cloud system. Show All Ultimately, we investigated error
    rate [33] measurement to analyze further the performance of the proposed BFL-PSO
    algorithm against the existing EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML, and IMPSO approaches, and
    the results are shown in Fig. 11. The error rate values for the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML,
    IMPSO, and suggested techniques were 4.56, 7.34, 11.23, 3.23, and 1.02, respectively,
    shown in the figure. Compared to the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-CODML, and IMPSO, the suggested
    BFL-PSO reduces the error rate by approximately 3.54, 6.32, 10.21, and 2.21, respectively.
    FIGURE 11. A comparison of the error rate with respect to the EMSA, J-SSO, HNS-COML,
    IMPSO, and the proposed BFL-PSO algorithms for healthcare data in cloud system.
    Show All B. Discussion The figure shows that the suggested algorithm outperforms
    the EMSA, J-SSO, HNSCODML, and IMPSO approaches in terms of cost, service delay
    time, response time, encryption times, decryption time, convergence speed, computational
    time, and error rate. In cost analysis, the J-SSO method has achieved 40 dollars,
    which is higher than the other methods. The IMPSO method has obtained 14 dollars,
    yet it is highly more than the proposed method because the developed model is
    highly cost-effective at 2 dollars. Moreover, the HNS-CODML method has taken a
    higher service delay time of 11.67 sec, which is 40% more than the other method
    and 70% higher than the proposed approach. However, the proposed method is 70%
    lesser service delay time than the earlier models. While increasing the size of
    the data, the encryption time will increase. However, the proposed method has
    achieved very less time as 1, 5, 10, and 19 seconds for data bit sizes of 8,18,
    24, and 32. The earlier EMSA method has obtained higher encryption time for the
    24 th and 32 nd data bits. The EMSA and J-SSO performance results are slightly
    identical. Consequently, the decryption time is also increased due to varying
    data bits. For small data bits, the conventional methods are performed faster,
    yet higher data bits consume more time for decryption. The proposed method takes
    less time and is 60% superior to the earlier methods. The convergence speed of
    the proposed method is 20% more than the HNS-CODML method and 50% and 70% more
    than the EMSA and J-SSO methods. Furthermore, the I MPSO computational complexity
    is higher than the earlier and proposed method, yet the proposed method has achieved
    very less complexity. The error rate of the HNS-COML method is more than the other
    methods. The analysis justified that the proposed method has achieved higher performance
    in terms of less cost, service delay time, encryption time, decryption time, computational
    time, error time, and higher convergence speed. The feasibility of the suggested
    approach in real-time applications is determined by various aspects, including
    the complexity of the problem, the amount of data, and the processing resources
    available. The suggested approach outperforms traditional approaches in terms
    of computing complexity, convergence speed, error rate, optimal encryption, and
    decryption durations, service and response times, and other factors. Besides,
    the suggested model also makes use of the PSO and bee foraging learning algorithms,
    which are well-known in optimization issues for their ease of use, adaptability,
    and capacity to manage several objectives concurrently. The fundamental PSO technique
    has undergone several extensions and modifications to meet a variety of optimization
    issues, including healthcare data security in cloud systems. Hence, it demonstrated
    a superior appropriateness for the realistic settings as compared to other options.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion Cloud computing has the potential to facilitate the healthcare
    system by providing clinicians and other healthcare professionals with ubiquitous
    access to patient monitoring and other medical classified records for decision-making.
    Nonetheless, Security is one of the main obstacles that must be conquered to convince
    healthcare systems to adopt the cloud-based paradigm. In this study, we explored
    the data sanitization and restoration processes to generate the keys. We developed
    a multi-objective function for the degree of modification, hiding ratio, and information
    preservation ratio to enhance the Security of cloud-based systems for real-time
    patient monitoring and doctor-to-doctor exchange of sensitive medical data. The
    proposed model is highly effective for real-time practical application in validating
    real-time data. Consequently, by employing the Bee-Foraging Learning-based Particle
    Swarm Optimization algorithm, which learns the hiding ratio, degree of modification,
    and information preservation ratio to acquire the optimal key, high Security for
    transferring healthcare data into the cloud system is ensured. The proposed approach
    has achieved a 3.2 sec service delay time, 80% of convergence speed, 1 sec and
    1.5-sec encryption and decryption time, and a 1.02% of error rate. The proposed
    BFL-PSO algorithm is evaluated against cutting-edge Euclidean L3P-based Multi-Objective
    Successive Approximation (EMSA), Shark Smell Optimization (J-SSO), Improved Multi-Objective
    Particle Swarm Optimization (IMPSO), and Hashed Needham Schroeder (HNS) Cost Optimized
    Deep Machine Learning (HNS-CODML) security algorithms in terms of Security, delay
    time, encryption time, error rate, and convergence speed. The results demonstrate
    that the proposed work effectively transfers healthcare data that is cleverly
    linked to the cloud environment while maintaining high-level Security. Future
    user identification during multi-level setup will use a secure authentication
    method, including artificial intelligence-based hashing in an authorization framework
    that can fend off fraud assaults and secure privacy. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors

  description: Irrigation is an essential agronomic practice in intensive apple production.
    Under the predicted scenario of climate change and increased pressure for sustainability
    in the future, irrigation is becoming more important. The practical use of soil
    moisture sensors could support farmers in improving irrigation scheduling. Recent
    technical advances in wireless communication, such as Long Range Wide Area Networks

    sensors, data transfer by LoRaWAN, and data visualization on a Smartphone Application.
    The project partners, Research Center Laimburg, Advisory Service Beratungsring,
    and the company Alperia worked since 2019 together to achieve this goal. A sensor
    network of 120 soil moisture sensors was established within the apple growing
    area of South Tyrol near Bolzano, Italy. Data were collected during the growing
    seasons 2019 and 2020. At the same time, the data flow system from the sensors
    to the database backend was technically improved. Finally, the technical basis
    for future DLT/blockchain-based data trails validation has been prepared.

    the integration of IoT and cloud computing and its impact on data management in
    irrigation systems, the paper does not delve deeply into specific case studies
    or empirical evidence related to real-time automated irrigation management.


    One limitation of the paper is that it does not provide a specific case study
    or empirical evidence focused on real-time automated irrigation management systems.
    The analysis is primarily based on a literature review and theoretical concepts,
    which may limit its practical implications for implementing and evaluating such
    systems in real-world scenarios.'

    : The internet of things (IoT) has been a major buzzword in recent years, with
    the potential to connect a huge number of devices to the internet and each other.
    The integration of all of these devices and data sources into a cohesive system
    is one of the key challenges involved in the development of the IoT. Cloud integration
    is one approach that can be used to achieve this, and there are several different
    cloud-based IoT platforms available. As consequences, IoT and cloud computing
    has drastically changed the environment of technological development. A synergistic
    strategy that combines the strengths of these two breakthrough technologies into
    one package is estimated to provide enormous benefits. Despite these advantages,
    the integration of such technologies poses numerous issues and challenges. An
    in-depth analysis of each of these technologies is discussed, along with the advantages,
    challenges, and limitations associated with convergent approach. The preferred
    reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method has been
    used to identify all relevant articles from the literature, and the most relevant
    articles have been included for further analysis. The relevant articles have been
    analysed using the method of the Bibliometric network, such as co-authorship analysis,
    term co-occurrence. Furthermore, taxonomy of IoT-based cloud applications has
    been discussed and quality of service (QoS) factors-based analysis for each applications
    domain has been done. In this review, we take a look at some of the most popular
    IoT cloud integration platforms and compare their features and capabilities. In
    addition, we have investigated a variety of related technologies and anticipated
    future developments. Keywords : Internet of things (IoT), Cloud computing, Edge

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture plays an importance role in sustaining
    food shortage and global economy. Agriculture crops has been cultivated for many
    years back as it holds the key element in various cuisine around the world. High
    cash value input of agricultural crops in agribusiness among farmers also contributed
    to extensive of agricultural crop planting [1]. Sustainability in agricultural
    production are very challenging task as main restriction input are deprived from
    variety factor (deficiency of nutrient, environmental changes and pest management)
    (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1 The main factors restricts crop’s sustainability [1] Full
    size image Among these three factors, deficiency of nutrient element (potassium,
    nitrogen, phosphorus) and problem in water management become major problem in
    ensuring the stability of crop’s production in each of reap seasons. As an alternative,
    fertigation technique does emerge as a solution to tackle the nutritional and
    irrigation problem in plant. Fertigation technique considered as one of effective
    method to distributes evenly amount of water and fertilizer depending on different
    type of crops [2]. Nevertheless, the most common way to detect crop’s nutritional
    status are by visualize the colour changes in plant but this is time consuming
    process and the result are not always accurate [3]. Thus, a variety of methods
    and technology for data monitoring and decision support system has been develop
    in effort to optimize crop yields in agriculture by emphasizing on factors that
    affect the growth of plants (irrigation, nutritional status etc.). Precision agriculture
    is concept on supplying exact amount of resources on the exact duration of time
    [4]. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology together with fertigation
    agriculture lead to precision agriculture in term of data collection and monitoring
    approaches to increase crop’s yield while minimizing impact of excessive fertilizers
    and irrigation on environmental [5]. Data retrieval using via sensors gives better
    understanding and specific insight on physical environment (bio diversity, soil
    analysis and weather indicator) leading to the precise data measurement. The development
    of IoT data driven in agriculture sector together with variety of wireless technology
    had been explored for example, Bluetooth [6], Wi-Fi [7], ZigBee [8] and LoRa [9]
    which interestingly gives an options to farmers for farm management according
    to the size of farm. In many dimensions of the agricultural landscape, IoT-based
    solutions prove to be very helpful and these smart solutions could also be lush
    in smart irrigation with optimal water utilization [10]. Therefore, fertigation
    technology and implementation of IoT in crops are briefly discuss in Sects. 2
    and 3. 2 Application of Fertigation Technique in Crops This section exploring
    the details on fertigation applied in various crops with consideration of concept
    and system design together with fertilizer management in subsections 2.1 and 2.2.
    2.1 Concept and System Design on Fertigation Technique Fertigation system is on
    of popular agriculture technique of based on integration irrigation and fertilizer
    in one system for time controlling water management. In fertigation, fertilizers
    were dissolved in certain amount of water at the right time and sufficient quantity
    of nutrients provided and to the root zone to ensure maximum absorption of more
    crops per drop of water [2]. The advantages of fertigation system include (i)
    sufficient water and fertilizers to minimize nutrient loss and leaching (ii) costly
    chemical are applied efficiently (iii) reduce major cost of labour and machineries
    and (iv) Soil erosion minimization [11]. Drip water fertigation have more advantages
    compared to conventional fertigation system as the droplet water from drip nozzle
    ensure the wetness of soil and increasing the probability of nutrient absorption
    in soil [12]. Drip fertigation technique were specifically designed for specific
    crop, climatic and soil condition [13]. Drip fertigation architecture consist
    of several equipment such as fertilizer, water tank, dripper, timer, water pump
    and connected pipe line. Feeding of nutrient soluble to plants are by drippers.
    The dedicated drippers were connected to the main pipe line later connected to
    the main nutrient solution (combination of water and fertilizer) tank. As the
    dripper drop the nutrient solution according to the need of specific crops, the
    timer are used to control the supply amount of fertilizer a day [14]. Figure 2
    shown the basic architecture of drip fertigation. Fig. 2 The drip fertigation
    system [26] Full size image 2.2 Fertilizer in Various Crops In fertigation, specific
    amount and type of fertilizers are supply accordingly to the type of plant. This
    include of (i) type of plant and stage of growth (ii) irrigation system and soil
    type and (iii) quality of available water. The sensitivity of a plant to the forms
    of N should also be considered in varying physiological stages as most type of
    plants (roots area) are sensitive to the present of ammonia. Ammonia can cause
    damage to the root due to high root soluble sugar content. Phosphorus on the other
    hand is depending on pH level not to be diminished [12]. In Malaysia, AB fertilizer
    are extensively being used in fertigation system. AB fertilizer are composed into
    two types, Micro and macro nutrient. Most of the plants need macro nutrient more
    compared to micro nutrient. These two types of nutrients are originated from basic
    element of plant fertilizers known as NPK where N is Nitrogen, P is Phosphorus
    and K is Kalium/Potassium. Fertilizer in fertigation system is validated trough
    three main indicators, ensuring the sufficient nutrient being supplied to the
    plants. The parameters are pH level, EC, and TDS measurement. These three indicators
    are greatly affected to the growth of plant fruit. EC indicates concentration
    of fertilizer in water and measured in µS (Siemens) [26]. Different crops required
    different concentration of fertilizer varying from planting seedlings to fruit
    maturity as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Average EC readings for different stages
    of agricultural crops [15, 16] Full size table Though the EC are precisely measured,
    the efficiency of nutrient absorbance depend on pH value of crop’s medium. Average
    pH requirement for agricultural crops varies from 5.5 to 6.5. TDS in other ways
    is to measure either fertilizer is completely dissolved or not and important factor
    in providing crops quality in term of fruit taste and firmness [17]. Mixing of
    more than two types of fertilizer can affect the solubility of fertilizer causing
    impractical of nutrient management [13]. Thus, agricultural crops using fertigation
    system require three crucial remote monitoring of variable, pH, EC, and TDS as
    it is substantially affect to the grown and maturity of agricultural crops. Fertigation
    technique were proved as one of good solution in ensuring both water and fertilizer
    enough to cover up the growth factor depending on type of crops, however excessive
    water and fertilizer used in soil lead to bleaching and drainage problem that
    lead to increase of soil salinity and greatly affected the plant growth cycle.
    Thus, IoT based fertigation technique are used as initiative to control the amount
    of water and fertilizer supply in agricultural crops while wirelessly monitor
    condition of soil (soil moisture and soil temperature) and weather (temperature
    and humidity). Section 3 focusing on application of IoT in agriculture by deep
    review of architecture, sensor and wireless communication module used. 3 Overview
    of Internet of Things (IoT) in Agriculture IoT based fertigation precision farming
    are enabling the wireless monitoring on desired variables such as soil moisture,
    soil temperature, water level and weather condition in crop’s production while
    facilitate new era of modern digital technology with integrating sensors and communication
    standard. Radio Frequency (RF) transceiver, embedded device (microprocessor/microcontroller),
    sensors and power source (battery, solar panel) to operate as a complete monitoring
    system. Advantage of IoT are (i) simplification and major cost reduction in wiring
    and harness (ii) allowing impossible sensors deployment for extremely hard event
    monitoring (iii) speedy deployment and various sensors installation and (iv) mobility
    [18]. In agricultural crops fertigation system, IoT aiming to collect and monitor
    the growth of various crops variables for example; soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, pH level of EC, pH, TDS and water level. In this section, detail on
    architecture of IoT including with type of agriculture sensor and communication
    standard used as well as application of IoT in agriculture are explained in Sect.
    3.1, subsections 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and Sect. 3.2. 3.1 Architecture of IoT IoT hardware
    system has features of energy efficient, low cost processor, robust and reliable
    radio technology, long lifetime power source, various flexible I/O for various
    sensors and flexible open source development platform. IoT architecture comprise
    four major layers; sensing, network, analyzing and application [19]. Type of sensors,
    communication modules and related works of IoT implementation that have been done
    previously are discussed in next subsection. 3.1.1 Type of Agriculture Sensors
    IoT in general view, consist of few end-nodes and base station [20], depend on
    networking layer for data transferring to platform layer and application platform.
    Sensing is a method used to collect data of real object and phase, including activities
    such as drop in temperature or pressure. Sensing activities activated by things
    called sensors which integrated with embedded device [21]. Different sensors for
    different applications were used according to the parameter or properties needed
    by the system and users. For fertigation in agricultural crops, several parameters
    such as soil moisture, nutrient status and water level in main tank are monitor
    trough sensors. Sensors selection play the important role in IoT based agriculture
    development in order to ensure the robustness, reliability, accuracy and common
    type of sensors used in agriculture. There are six factors to be consider when
    choosing sensors which are (1) precision and accuracy (2) identified environmental
    changes (3) signal conditioning (4) Response time (5) cost (6) size. 3.1.2 Revolutionary
    Communication Standard RFID have been used as communication modules to collect
    data from sensors. RFID at the first place being developed for identification
    purpose that later growth more interest in possible application which led to the
    development of new range RFID outfit with sensor for wider range of applications
    [22]. Several work on application of RFID (semi passive/active tag) in agriculture
    such as soil temperature and salinity [23] and humidity [24] were proved to increase
    the productivity of plant and help farmers to manage to their plantation. Commonly,
    application of RFID in sensing environment used semi-passive tag or active tag
    rather than passive tag. Integrating RFID technology in sensing world led to the
    development IoT standardize protocol for easy implementation of sensing application.
    This is due to installation complexity. Robustness guaranteed, cost and easiest
    installation has led Bluetooth as communication module in WSN with operating frequency
    2.4 GHz [25]. Development of Bluetooth in IoT environment especially in agriculture
    productivity had been noticed such temperature [6]. Even though Bluetooth module
    have advantage in term of transmission reliability, however it is difficult to
    emerge as an alternative choice for further deployment of sensor network application
    due to its expansive maintenance cost and energy inefficient and relying on dual
    radio approaches. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is developed to provide a framework
    and lower power networks and cost of MAC and Physical layers, leaving the upper
    layers to be developed according to the market needs. IEEE 802.15.4 standard like
    ZigBee [26] are the most common to deploy and its outlined the criteria of the
    physical and MAC layers for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN)
    and basically used peer to peer and star topologies. ZigBee based 802.15.4 offer
    a flexible protocol, simple, short range operation, cheaper, reliable data transfer,
    easy installation and reasonable battery life. However, ZigBee technology is lacking
    in terms of security, prone to attack from unauthorized people and limited coverage
    [21]. Development of IEEE 802.15.4 standard (ZigBee) somehow show great interest
    in agriculture deployment such greenhouse [27] and storage house [28]. Since different
    application needs specific requirement in terms of capacity and range coverage,
    long power wide area (LPWA) are being introduced. Long range (LoRa) is a spread
    spectrum modulation technique which is based on 802.15.4 standard are the leading
    wireless communication module as efficient solution of connecting sensors which
    has features of better capacity, longer battery lifetime and lower cost [29].
    3.2 Application of IoT as Monitoring System in Agriculture IoT have great impact
    in agriculture sector by monitoring the most important parameters [30] as stated
    below: Environment changes (temperature, and humidity) Fertility condition (soil
    moisture, and soil temperature) Irrigation management (water level). The wireless
    technology application does emerge in various sector such as, home appliances,
    vehicles and health including agriculture sector. In the earlier development of
    IoT technology, various wireless communication module such as, Bluetooth and ZigBee
    has been introduced. A number of researchers have reported developing IoT based
    platform including [30] who developed wireless irrigation system (WIS) for irrigating
    Romaine Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa) and Red Lettuce (Loollo Rosa) in Greenhouse using
    Bluetooth. The Romance Lettuce were plant in 64 bags. 32 of them were irrigated
    by WIS system and timer were set to pump water in every 15 minutes started at
    7 am. Five sensing nodes were setup with Bluetooth as wireless communication at
    different location. As the result, the author reveals that the plant in test group
    grown higher and heavier compared to plant in normal irrigation system. The electricity
    and water consumption also were low than normal irrigation system with 60% efficiency.
    While, [8] in other work develop a system that low cost and energy efficient frame
    work for precision agriculture in automated water supply for sweet melon using
    ZigBee approach. The system was placed at a pot of sweet melon plant and the senor
    node and BS station were setup in outdoor and indoor. The author only shown the
    graph on variation of temperature and humidity only but the details discussion
    on result were not provided. Meanwhile, using the same wireless communication
    standard, Ref. [31] present development of IoT system for real time temperature
    and humidity monitoring for Chongqing mountain citrus using ZigBee technology
    in China. The IoT system comprises of HA2002 (soil temperature), HA2001 (Soil
    moisture) and Fk-WS (air temperature and humidity) sensor that integrate on JN5139
    module for data collection and transmission from node to base station. After a
    year of the implemented design in citrus orchard, author reveals that soluble
    slid content of fruit increase with 1–2%, orchard per mu yield increase 500 kg
    or more and 20% save in water and fertilizer management. The trend of development
    IoT based platform keep increasing with new wireless technologies; LoRa, which
    focusing in increasing area of coverage and considerable amount of literature
    has been published on development of IoT with Lora technologies. These studies
    include [32] that develop IoT system for monitoring water level of trough in cow
    barn. Reference [33] discuss on work of development of Smart Mushroom House (SMH)
    using LoraWAN-IoT technology controlling environmental factor (temperature, humidity
    and Co2) that affect the growth of Shitake Mushroom. The SMH using controller
    are setup with humidifier and exhaust fan for controlling the wetness and c02
    level in mushroom house. The transmission between SMH controller, humidifier and
    exhaust fan were established by LoraWAN wireless communication module with distance
    of 100 m of EN to Base Station (BS). Lora works better with open environment rather
    than in buildings (concrete walls). IoT Monitoring system indeed gives farmers
    deep insight on changes in factors (weather condition and soil condition) that
    affected crop’s growth even in small changes. 4 Limitation and Challenge As previously
    mentioned, the monitoring IoT system comprised of sensors and wireless communication
    modules located at the end-nodes as transmitting components while the gateway
    receiving all data from the nodes. Data transfer reliability is important as data
    loss from sensor nodes can cause the recidivism of crops growth. Position of sensor
    node and gateway play an important role in determine the reliability of conveying
    data to gateway. Furthermore, number of sensor nodes influenced the transmission
    of data, which greater nodes leads to higher possibilities of data collision between
    nodes and center station [32]. The communications modules have different standards
    and specifications, thus the user needs to identify the technical requirements
    at first e.g. for this review of various agricultural crop, requirements are based
    on the area of the farm and distance between node sensors and gateway. References

    SLIDE identification and control, integrated allocation model, synergetic coupling,
    water quality and quantity, Yellow River INTRODUCTION Listen Water quantity and
    quality are two basic attributes of water resources, and they belong to an interdependent
    unity. With the growth of population, economic and social development, the increasing
    demand of water resources and the increase of sewage discharge, the double pressure
    of water quality and quantity is increasing, and the integrated allocation of
    quantity and quality has become a hot issue in the current research field (Wang
    et al. 2013). Globally speaking, research on river water quantity and quality
    is limited by many factors, and research findings on the integrated regulation
    of water quantity and quality are few (Shokri et al. 2014). There are few studies
    on the joint allocation of water quantity, quality and water shortage. The main
    research works focus on the impact of water quality on the process of water resources
    allocation, or use water quality as a constraint to develop water resources allocation
    schemes (Dong et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2015). The key technology of integrated
    water quality and quantity research is to establish an integrated allocation model.
    The regulation objectives of an integrated allocation model of water quantity
    and quality include: water allocation, pollution control and water ecological
    protection. The model can be divided into three categories according to the purpose
    of solving problems: (1) a model for joint optimal regulation of water quantity
    and quality with reservoir optimal operation as central (Nikoo et al. 2014); (2)
    a model based on a carrying capacity assessment of the ecological environment
    system of a river network, and taking the simulation of water quantity and quality
    of the river network as central (Chen et al. 2014a, 2014b); (3) a model focusing
    on the hydrological environment effect of rivers under the control of sluice dams,
    and the regulation and control of sluice dams on polluted rivers (Liu et al. 2014).
    From the view point of modeling method, the current joint allocation of water
    quality and quantity can achieve the goal of water quality and quantity control
    through water quality and quantity joint simulation models. ‘Loose coupling’ is
    widely used in coupling technology (Zhao et al. 2012), i.e. the separation of
    the water quality and quantity model, and the realization of water quantity and
    quality simulation in turn, ignoring the relation and interaction between water
    quality and quantity. Control technology generally simplifies the water quality
    target as a constraint, and lacks process coordination within the model, which
    does not consider real-time feedback and on-line identification function. Therefore,
    most models only solve the problem of water quality effect evaluation of river
    water allocation and do not realize the integrated allocation of water quantity
    and quality. The Yellow River is short of water resources, the contradiction between
    water supply and demand is prominent, and water pollution is serious. At present,
    research on Yellow River regulation mainly focuses on flood control, silt reduction,
    water supply and power generation. For the study of water quality, it is based
    on the ability to absorb pollution and the law of pollutant transformation. It
    mostly aims at a single problem such as water regulation, capacity assessment,
    or water quality evaluation and so on. Study on the integration of water quantity
    and quality is still at the stage of comprehensive evaluation (Lyu et al. 2013).
    The research methods and means of water resources integration allocation need
    to be deepened. Therefore, taking the Lanzhou to Hekouzhen reach as an example,
    by means of systematic generalization and supported by numerical simulation, a
    model of integrated allocation of water quantity and quality is established, and
    the water allocation scheme is optimally put forward. GENERALIZATION OF TYPICAL
    REACH General situation of the reach Listen The soil and water resources distribution
    in the Yellow River Basin is uneven. The main water production area is located
    above the Lanzhou section, and the runoff discharge at the Lanzhou section accounts
    for 62% of the total runoff of the Yellow River. The reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen
    is 1,362 km long. It spans Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia provinces and regions.
    It belongs to arid and semi-arid areas with less water production. The average
    annual water consumption of the reach accounts for 41% of the total water use
    in the Yellow River Basin, and the discharge of waste water accounts for 32%.
    It is the main water resource consuming area and pollutant source area of the
    Yellow River, and the water quantity and quality problems are prominent. The Longyang
    Gorge, Liujiaxia and other large reservoirs have been built in the upper reaches
    of the Yellow River, with a regulation capacity of more than 200.0 × 108m3, which
    has the basic conditions for carrying out the integrated regulation of water quantity
    and quality. Generalization of the reach Listen The calculation is carried out
    according to different sections. The main engineering nodes, control nodes and
    system elements such as water supply and drainage are expressed by generalized
    ‘point’ and ‘line’ elements, and the system network node diagram describing the
    hydraulic connection of the watershed is drawn, which is used as the basis of
    simulation and calculation. In order to ensure the simulation accuracy of the
    model, the river reach generalization and node division could follow five principles:
    reflecting the characteristics of river flow and sewage production; reflecting
    the hydraulic connection and the process of movement transformation; reflecting
    the taking and using of drainage characteristics; reflecting the engineering conditions
    of the reach; and reflecting the water quality and quantity requirements of the
    reach. According to the investigation, there are 23 water intake outlets, 44 drainage
    outlets, three tributaries and 20 hydrological and water quality monitoring stations
    from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen section. The river reach water system is generalized
    into ten basic nodes of runoff, confluence, power station, reservoir, urban water
    use, agricultural irrigation, runoff control, wetland, hydrological station and
    water quality monitoring station. The generalized network nodes of the river reach
    water system are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Generalized
    nodes of the reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen of the Yellow River. INTEGRATED ALLOCATION
    MODEL CONSTRUCTION OF WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY Water quantity model Listen Based
    on the hydraulic connection of the nodes and the evolution, transformation and
    balance of river flow, a water allocation model with network technology as the
    core is established to simulate the response of the river water resources system
    under different allocation strategies of water resources (Lee et al. 2010). Construction
    of water quantity model Listen Aiming at the minimum water shortage and reasonable
    distribution of water in the reach of the river, the main purpose is to solve
    the problem of the spatial–temporal equilibrium of water volume and water allocation
    in different water demand departments. When the water supply cannot meet the water
    demand, the spatial–temporal distribution of water is optimized through reasonable
    allocation, to increase the system water supply and realize the minimum water

    the ecological environment of the section. (2) in which E is the water demand

    (4) Output constraint Listen The hydropower station should meet the requirement
    of system output (Qian et al. 2013). (5) Safety constraint Listen Safety requirements
    for reservoir operation. (6) Water balance constraint Listen (7) Water available
    constraint Listen The total water consumption in the region is less than the water
    distribution index in this region (Peng et al. 2013). (8) Variables non-negative
    constraint Listen In which QR(x, t) is the discharge in the t period of the x
    reach; Qmin(x,t) is the minimum discharge demand of the reach; QM(m, t) is the

    Listen Based on the simulation of pollutant migration and transformation in river
    channels and the control goal of water quality in the water function areas, a
    water quality model with numerical simulation as the core is established to simulate
    the river environmental effects under different water resource allocation and
    pollutant discharge scenarios. Construction of water quality model Listen In order
    to meet the requirement of water quality in the water function areas, the model
    was established with the aim of minimum deviation between water quality index
    and target water quality index (Razmkhah et al. 2010). (9) in which θj is the
    weight coefficient of water quality in reach j; Cob is the target water quality
    control index in the water function areas; is the water quality index function
    under water intake ⁠. Boundary condition treatment Lateral inflow Listen This
    mainly includes three categories. (1) Tributary inflow. Runoff and pollutant concentration
    can be calculated with long-term observation data. (2) Sewage discharged to the
    river channel. Regular monitoring of discharges and emission concentrations. (3)
    Interval surface inflow. Inflow and pollutant concentration are calculated by
    using a distributed model. There is no underground water inflow because the river
    bed is higher than the surface land outside the river. The mass of the lateral
    pollutants entering the equilibrium region can be expressed as follows (Tang et
    al. 2014): (10) in which m1t is the mass of pollutants from lateral inflow; QRu(l,
    t) is the inflow at the I lateral entry point in the x reach; Clt is the pollutant
    concentration at the I entry point; and L is the total inflow reaches. Boundary
    outflow Listen This mainly refers to the amount of water (agricultural, industrial,
    living water use) taken from the section, which is generalized as the intake node
    with spatial coordinates, and the pollutant concentration of the water intake
    is deduced according to the water quality model. The quality of the extraction
    pollutant is related to the quantity of water intake and the concentration of
    the pollutant. The pollutant mass of the water intake can be expressed as follows:
    (11) in which m2t is the mass of water intake pollutants; Cijt is the pollutant
    concentration for the j user, t period and in i area; Qs(i, j, t) is the water
    intake for the j user, t period and in i area; and I, J is the total number of
    water users and regions in the reach, respectively. Considering the degradation
    of pollutants, discharge of pollutants along the river and water intake, a model
    of river water quality is established according to the principle of material balance
    (Yang et al. 2014). (12) in which Cx-1 is the pollutant concentration at time
    t above the cross-section x; Z is the length between the upper and lower section;
    Kp is the degradation coefficient of pollutant p; Zl is the length between the
    section x and the l lateral inflow; u is the flow velocity of the reach, there
    being a nonlinear relationship between the flow velocity and the flow rate; and
    the other symbols have the same meaning as above. Model coupling and control Listen
    Joint control of water quantity and quality is the basis of integrated allocation,
    and data transmission, coupling and coordination are the key to realizing joint
    control. Using decomposition, coordination, coupling and control methods, the
    model is decomposed into water quantity model M1 and water quality model M2. The
    function of M1 is to calculate reservoir operation, water evolution, water distribution
    and section water balance in the reach, and output discharge from the section
    and nodes will be used as the basic input of M2. Based on the output of M1, M2
    simulates the process of pollutant transfer and transformation and gives feedback
    to M1 on the concentration of pollutants. The real time connection between the
    two models is established by means of data transfer, and the synchronous coupling
    of the two models is realized. The coordinated control model M0 is used to identify
    the water intake, the discharge under the section and the water quality of the
    water function areas output by the water quantity model. According to the satisfaction
    degree of the system information identification control target, Model M0 gives
    feedback to M1 and M2 on the target deviation of water quantity and quality allocation
    according to the satisfaction degree of the control target of system information
    identification, and controls the direction of adjustment and correction to guide
    the model to be optimized step by step. The composition of the model is shown
    in Table 1. Table 1 Model composition of integrated water quality and quantity

    following measures: cross-section water intake control, cross-section discharge
    control, taking the water quality of the water function areas as identification
    control variables, the top-down forward calculation of water quality and the reverse
    control of water quality from bottom to top, on-line adjustment, rolling correction
    of water amount and pollutants into the river, etc. being carried out. The model
    framework and control flow are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Model framework and control process. Forward calculus Listen According to
    the water requirement of the section below the Liujiaxia Reservoir, water inflow
    and water loss between sections, the initial operation line of the Longyangxia
    Reservoir and the Liujiaxia Reservoir is preliminarily determined. Discharge is
    carried out according to preset flow. The water evolution is carried out at intervals
    of one hour and river reach by reach. Reverse control Listen The reverse calculation
    is carried out to determine the minimum discharge of the reservoir. Taking the
    requirement of water intake, cross-section discharge and water quality index as
    the control condition, when the result output does not meet the control condition,
    the discharge under Longyangxia Reservoir and Liujiaxia Reservoir is automatically
    changed to recalculate the discharge, so as to iterate calculation until the section
    discharge and water quality meet the requirements (Zhang et al. 2011). Process
    adjustment Listen To identify the water intake, the section discharge and the
    water quality parameters of the water function areas, if the outputs are not satisfied,
    then, coordinate the control to reduce the amount of water intake and the amount
    of pollutants entering the river in a discounted proportion; if it is still not
    satisfied, then go up by feedback and adjust the parameters (Zhang et al. 2010).
    Rolling correction Listen The water quality and quantity simulation results and
    system status are renewed at time intervals. According to the results of the water
    quantity calculation in the previous period and the pollution control situation,
    the remaining period water allocation scheme is recalculated, that is, revise
    the scheme, and then roll to the end of the sequence (Yuan et al. 2015). MODEL
    VERIFICATION Model parameters Listen (1) Water quantity parameters. Considering
    the relatively complex flow in the Lanzhou to Hekouzhen reach, the Muskinggem
    algorithm is used to calculate the flow. The relevant main parameters include:
    flow advance time and flow specific gravity factor, which is determined by the
    flow, the flow velocity and the distance between the upper and lower sections.
    (2) Water quality parameters. According to the relevant research results, the
    variation range of chemical oxygen demand (COD) attenuation coefficient is 0.15–0.25
    and the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) attenuation coefficient is 0.3–0.6 in the Yellow
    River (Yun et al. 2005). There are many factors affecting the attenuation coefficient
    of pollutants. The fluctuation of influence factors will cause the change of pollutant
    attenuation coefficient. Through sensitivity analysis, the concentration of pollutants,
    water temperature, hydraulic characteristics and suspended solids are considered
    as the key factors affecting the comprehensive attenuation coefficient of a water
    quality model (Zhou et al. 2013). The attenuation coefficient of pollutants in
    a river reach consists of two parts: the basic coefficient and the influence coefficient.
    (13) in which is the basic value of attenuation coefficient of polluntant p; ⁠,
    is the affecting coefficient of pollutant p attenuation of factor q at time t
    and their variation respectively. The influence factors of the main pollutant
    attenuation coefficient are set out in Table 2. Rating and verification Listen
    (1) Parameter rating. The main parameter rating in the model is carried out based
    on the period 2001–2007. The measured runoff of Lanzhou section is taken as the
    basic inflow of the model, and the amount of water intake, the process of water
    intake and the discharge of pollutants are taken as the basic input. The simulated
    discharge process and pollutant concentration in different sections are compared
    with the measured water quantity and quality data from 2001 to 2007 in the section
    from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen of the Yellow River, and the parameters are adjusted
    until the fitting accuracy meets the requirement, then, the parameter rate is
    determined. (2) Model verification. The reliability of the model is verified using
    2008–2010 as the verification period. The discharge of 14 main sections from Lanzhou
    to Hekouzhen are simulated using the water volume model. The model simulation
    accuracy criteria are required as follows. The average deviation of monthly discharge
    is less than 8%. The Nash coefficients of section water flow simulation are greater
    than 0. 84. The main pollutant concentration, water quality category and change
    trend of the main section simulated by the water quality model are basically consistent
    with the actual measurement. The relative errors of COD and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)
    are less than 20%. Table 2 Influence factors of main pollutant attenuation coefficient

    ANALYSIS Basic data analysis Listen (1) Water resources quantity. From 1956 to
    2000, the average annual natural runoff at the Tangnaihe section is 205.2 × 108
    m3, and 329.90 × 108 m3 at the Lanzhou section. The amount of surface water resources
    between Lanzhou and Hekouzhen is 17.68 × 108 m3, the loss of evaporation and leakage
    between the two sections is 15.82 × 108 m3, the natural runoff at the Hekouzhen
    section is 331.8 × 108 m3, and the amount of groundwater availability is 40.55
    × 108 m3. (2) Water demand. It is predicted that the total water demand from Lanzhou
    to Hekouzhen at the 2020 level (relative to probabilities of 50%, 75% and 90%)
    is 191.1 × 108 m3, 200.0 × 108 m3, and 207.3 × 108 m3 respectively, of which more
    than 50 percent are agricultural water use. Water demands for different reaches
    are shown in Table 3. (3) Pollutant emission. Pollutants in the reach come mainly
    from municipal sewage, industrial waste water and agricultural irrigation water
    recession. According to the current pollutant discharge level and the development
    trend of different water use and drainage technology, and based on the water demand
    of different sectors in the river reach, the average annual COD emission from
    Lanzhou to Hekouzhen at the 2020 level is predicted to be 53.8 × 104t. The amount
    of ammonia and nitrogen (NH3-N) emission is 6.328 × 104t. Emissions of major pollutants
    are shown in Table 4. (4) Section discharge and ecological water flow control.
    According to ‘The Detailed Rules in the Implementation of the Yellow River Water
    Allocation Act’, the minimum control discharge at the sections of Xiaheyan, Shizuishan
    and Toudaoguai is 200 m3/s, 150 m3/s and 50 m3/s respectively. Annual discharge
    quantity at the Hekouzhen section should not be less than 197.0 × 108 m3. (5)
    Water quality objectives in water function areas. There are five water function
    primary areas and 22 water function secondary areas in the reach from Lanzhou
    to Hekouzhen. The water quality targets in the water function areas are all of
    class III, corresponding to the target water quality control index: COD is not
    more than 20 mg/L, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) is not more than 1 mg/L. Table 3 Prediction

    chart of simulation, feedback, coordination and control, under the guidance and
    control of water discharge and water quality target in the water function areas,
    through water intake adjustment, control and feedback, and reducing the amount
    of pollutant emission, the integrated allocation purpose of water quality and
    quantity can be realized. (1) Water quantity allocation. The requirements of section
    discharge and water quality in function areas are met by the water intake control
    and water supply process. Water allocation results: the annual average water supply
    above Hekouzhen is 202.50 × 108 m3, in which surface water supply is 166.50 ×
    108 m3, underground water supply is 23.59 × 108 m3, reclaimed water is 12.42 ×
    108 m3, and water shortage in the reach is 22.41 × 108 m3. Water intake is controlled
    reasonably. The annual average natural runoff at the section of Lanzhou is 329.90
    × 108 m3, the annual average water intake above the Lanzhou section is 30.67 ×
    108 m3, and the water consumption is 22.02 × 108 m3. The annual average water
    discharge at the Lanzhou section is 315.9 × 108 m3. The annual average surface
    water consumption in the reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen is 125.2 × 108 m3. The
    reduction of water consumption is 6.72 × 108 m3 compared with the surface water
    consumption index allocated by the ‘87 Water Diversion Scheme’. The section discharge
    meets the relevant requirements. The average annual inflow of the Lanzhou section
    is 307.90 × 108 m3. The section discharge at Xiaheyan, Shizuishan and Hekouzhen
    is 288.0 × 108 m3 and 263.7 × 108 m3, and 206.6 × 108 m3 respectively. Water allocation
    in the different reaches is shown in Table 5. (2) Water quality allocation. Through
    controlling the section discharge volume, the environmental capacity is improved,
    the amount of pollutant emission is controlled and the water quality in the water
    function areas is improved. Water quality allocation results: the discharge of
    waste water is controlled to 41.34 × 108 m3, in which the discharge of industrial
    and domestic sewage is 17.28 × 108 m3 and the agricultural irrigation water recession
    is 24.05 × 108 m3. The main pollutant COD into the river is reduced to 26.5 ×
    104t, which is reduced by 27.3 × 104t, and the rate of reduction is 50.6%. The
    amount of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) entering the river is controlled within 2.17
    × 104 t, which is reduced by 4.15 × 104t, and the rate of reduction is 65.7%.
    The water quality in 14 water function areas in the river reach achieves the third
    class (class III), and the water quality control goal is realized. The pollutants
    entering the river are shown in Table 6. Table 5 Water allocation scheme in the

    of water quantity and quality allocation Listen (1) Water distribution in the
    reach. The exploitation of groundwater is controlled to 23.59 × 108 m3. Under
    the condition of meeting the discharge quantity and water quality target, the
    average annual water supply from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen is 202.50 × 108 m3, water
    shortage is 27.45 × 108 m3, and the water shortage rate is 14.1%. Uniform distribution
    of water shortage in time and space and the target of the minimum water shortage
    have been realized. (2) Section discharge. The annual discharge at Hekouzhen section
    is 206.6 × 108m3, which is greater than the amount of the water regulation requirement
    (197.0 × 108 m3). The minimum discharge at the section is 269 m3/s, which is over
    the minimum controlled flow (250 m3/s). The discharge at the 14 control sections
    all meet the requirements of the downstream discharge process. (3) Water quality
    in the water function areas. The main pollutants (COD and NH3-N) in the reach
    of the river are strictly controlled. The maximum COD is no more than 20 mg/L,
    the highest ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) is no more than 0. 8 mg /L. The water quality
    at the main section and in the water function areas is up to class III (The State
    Surface Water Quality Standard). The water quality target rate in the water function
    areas reaches 100%. CONCLUSIONS Listen In view of the characteristics of the river
    reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen, such as the large amount of water intake and
    recession points, the large amount of water requirement and the complicated process,
    the reach was abstracted as a conceptual element of parameter expression by means
    of generalization. The water system network of a river reach was established in
    describing the hydraulic relation between various elements in mathematical language.
    Using decomposition, coordination, coupling and control methods, an integrated
    model of water quantity and quality was established. Through real-time transfer
    of water quantity and quality models the synchronous coupling of water quantity
    and quality was realized. Taking the 2020 level year of the Lanzhou to Hekouzhen
    reach as an example, the integrated allocation of water quantity and quality was
    carried out. It is shown by the results that the model can control the surface
    water intake from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen by identifying the water intake and section
    discharge. The surface water consumption of Lanzhou to Hekouzhen is 125.2 × 108m3,
    and the surface water intake is 166.5 × 108m3. Through the identification of water
    quality in the water function areas, the optimized COD and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)
    flow control reduction rates are 50.6% and 65.7% respectively, which effectively
    improve the water quality in the water function areas and meet the water quality
    target in the water function areas. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen The study is financially

- analysis: 'The paper titled "Design and development of real time data push in web-based
    automatic irrigation control system" mainly focuses on improving the real-time
    transmission of data in web-based automatic irrigation systems. While it does
    not explicitly discuss different data types used in irrigation management, it
    provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions related to implementing
    real-time data push in such systems.


    The paper proposes a data push scheme to improve the real-time performance of
    data transmission between the data layer, logic layer, and presentation layer
    of a web-based irrigation control system. The focus on enhancing real-time data
    transmission aligns with the section and subsection of the literature review that
    examines automation across the entire irrigation management pipeline, including
    data collection and real-time processing.


    Overall, the paper provides a practical approach to overcome the real-time data
    transmission bottleneck in web-based irrigation control systems, which indirectly
    supports the efficient collection and use of various data types in irrigation
    management. However, it does not delve into specific types of data used in irrigation

  description: 'The automatic irrigation control system based on web is a main trend
    of current water-saving technology development. In order to provide personalized
    irrigation control scheme and precise water metering, the system needs higher
    real-time data transmission performance. The real-time performance of web application
    is currently poor, and difficult to meet the needs of accurate irrigation control.
    Aiming at this problem, in this paper, the structure and bottleneck of real-time
    data transmission of web-based automatic irrigation control system was analyzed,
    and the data push scheme of improving the real-time performance was proposed.
    Based on observer pattern, the data push mode between data layer and logic layer,
    and that between logic layer and presentation layer were specifically designed.
    In the former data transmission process, the observed object is database table,
    and the observer is Web server monitoring program. After the data is inserted
    into the data table, the database immediately triggers the stored procedure to
    notify the relevant Web service program and executes updating data subject. In
    the latter data transmit process, the observed object is program object running
    on the Web server, and the observer is client program object running on the browser.
    Because the Web service program cannot directly initiate data connection to the
    client program. Therefore, in order to implement the observer pattern, it is essential
    to establish a real-time tow-way data connection in the client program loading
    process. Then through subscribing a group of data subjects, the client program
    can receive real-time data push as soon as the data subjects are updated. The
    connection between client and Web server is established and maintained by client
    connect request, then a streaming connection is evoked by client through which
    Web server streams data down to the client with no poll overhead. But these client-to-server
    messages are not sent over the streaming connection, instead an internal HTTP
    connection was used to send data for the duration of the operation. Through database,
    server and client programming, the construction of web-based irrigation control
    system and the realization of the real time data push mechanism were implemented.
    Then tests were carried out to quantitatively assess real-time performance of
    data acquisition and instruction sending process. The result showed that: the
    average delay of the data acquisition process was 1.7 seconds, the average delay
    of the control process was 3.4 seconds, and the real-time performance could basically
    meet the needs of equipment control and irrigation decision-making. The average
    delay of one-way data transmission in the software system was no more than 130
    milliseconds. The delay factors of the data pull mode were totally eliminated,
    and this improvement plays an important role in enhancing overall real-time performance
    of system. The results of this paper showed that, through the reasonable design
    and development, the real-time performance of the Web based irrigation control
    system can reach the level of desktop control system. When the system is accessed
    through internet or 4G mobile communication network, the delay is on the hundreds
    milliseconds level, which has little effect on the real-time performance of the
    system. The data push scheme can also be applied to other related monitoring and
    control software system in internet of things, which can improve the real-time
    performance with low cost.'

    technology, which benefits from high temporal measuring resolution, real-time
    data transfer and high spatial resolution of sensor data that shows in-field variations,
    has the potential to provide added value for crop production. The present paper
    explores how sensors and sensor networks have been utilised in the crop production
    process and what their added-value and the main bottlenecks are from the perspective
    of users. The focus is on sensor based applications and on requirements that users
    pose for them. Literature and two use cases were reviewed and applications were
    classified according to the crop production process: sensing of growth conditions,
    fertilising, irrigation, plant protection, harvesting and fleet control. The potential
    of sensor technology was widely acknowledged along the crop production chain.
    Users of the sensors require easy-to-use and reliable applications that are actionable
    in crop production at reasonable costs. The challenges are to develop sensor technology,
    data interoperability and management tools as well as data and measurement services
    in a way that requirements can be met, and potential benefits and added value
    can be realized in the farms in terms of higher yields, improved quality of yields,
    decreased input costs and production risks, and less work time and load. Keywords:
    sensors; sensor networks; crop production; agriculture 1. Introduction Agricultural
    production is vital for feeding the human population. Production of crops, however,
    show variation in space and time due to changes in weather conditions, different
    management practices and other external factors. Information on the day-to-day
    factors influencing crop growth has been important for farmers for ages. In the
    past farmers mainly used direct human observations to recognize these factors.
    In the last decades, however, more and more automatic sensor systems such as soil
    moisture sensors, weather stations and satellite or airborne sensors have been
    adopted [1]. Automatic sensors and sensor networks enable local and (near) real-time
    observations and monitoring, and may foster more sustainable crop production practices
    and, thus, lower negative environmental impacts of agriculture and food safety
    risks. Sensor and communication technology has quickly developed from off-line
    sensors using field loggers and manual downloading to wireless on-line sensor
    networks, and is moving toward interoperable and autonomous sensor webs [2]. This
    sensor web concept is based on the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework of the
    Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Within this framework, standard protocols, interfaces
    and web services to discover, task, exchange and process data from different sensors
    and sensor networks have been defined [3–5]. Geo-sensors were loosely defined
    by Nittel et al. in 2008 [6] as sensors that monitor phenomenon in a geographical
    place. Until now the development of sensors and sensor networks has mainly been
    driven by technological innovations. However, this technological push has been
    supported by growing needs for food and fiber, demands for reducing environmental
    effects of agriculture and concerns over food safety [7]. Also increasing competition
    in the global food market and decreasing profitability of European farms have
    been seen to support adoption of new technology in the farms [7,8]. Agriculture
    benefits from high temporal measuring resolution, real-time data transfer and
    high spatial resolution of sensor data that shows in-field variations [2,9–12].
    Sensor technology has the potential to provide added value for agriculture e.g.,
    for improving yield quality or for decreasing costs or risks in production. Currently
    sensor technology has been most commonly applied in real-time weather monitoring
    for support of management practices, and in precision agriculture [10,13]. Maturing
    technology has also enabled first commercial and operational applications in agriculture
    [14]. Sensor networks in agricultural applications have been studied with growing
    interest. Past papers mainly focused on technical issues (hardware, software,
    energy-consumption and communication) [4,9,11,13,14,16–18]. Also recent review
    articles [13,15,18] on sensor technology and sensor networks in agriculture had
    a predominantly technical perspective. More and more queries have been made for
    studies that focus on applications and operational use of sensor technology in
    the field of agriculture and environmental monitoring [14]. As far as we know,
    agricultural applications of sensor networks have not been analyzed or reviewed
    from a practical application and user point of view. Relevant questions when sensor
    networks are implemented in operational crop production and applications are:
    How do they support crop production? What added-value do they bring to production
    process? How do users benefit? What are the risks and bottlenecks involved? In
    the present paper we aim to explore these questions in crop production process.
    The analysis is done by comprehensive literature review and the analysis of two
    sensor network use cases. Literature review of geo-sensor network applications
    is limited to crop production including in-situ or portable sensors and sensors
    mounted in field or airborne vehicles or machines. 2. Sensors and Sensor Network
    Applications in Arable Crop Production 2.1. Literature Review 2.1.1. Sensing of
    Growing Conditions Many of farming decisions are based, at least partly, on weather
    information. Because weather is an important factor in agriculture, many agro-meteorological
    networks were founded decades ago to support agriculture [2]. Most countries provide
    agro-meteorological services by integrating national weather data with soil and
    agricultural data; such as crop growth models, plant disease and pest information.
    These are used for timing tasks like plant protection and irrigation. Many countries
    also offer alerting or forecast services and maintain separate agrometeorological
    station networks [19]. The first networks were based on meteorological stations
    and voluntary observers, but already in the 80s automated weather stations started
    to be commonly available [20,21]. These networks, some of them still operational,
    offered weather and soil information combined with agricultural models to support
    farmers’ management decisions [20,22]. The regional agro-meteorological sensor
    network, AgWeatherNet, from Washington State (USA) [10] is a recent example of
    a commercially successful sensor network application. It integrates biological
    knowledge and sensor data to provide decision support for fruit tree farmers.
    Also applications for irrigation system performance, crop-load monitoring and
    manure spreading employ weather data acquired by AgWeatherNet. Knowledge of the
    spatial variability of soil attributes within an agricultural field is critical
    for successful site-specific crop management. At the start of the growing season,
    the farmer is interested in the actual soil status (e.g., compaction, nutrient
    balance, pre crop) to decide on the required soil preparation activities. During
    the growing season, information on nutrient and pesticide fluxes is relevant for
    proper timing of management decisions. However, manual soil sampling and laboratory
    testing is tedious and expensive. Several studies have presented alternative soil
    sensing techniques which are able to assess this variability. Two main types of
    soil sensing techniques can be distinguished: (1) proximal sensors mounted on
    vehicles for on-the-go measurements [23], and (2) wireless sensor networks with
    individual nodes located at different positions and depths within an agricultural
    parcel [24]. Proximal sensing techniques can be defined as field based techniques
    that can be used to measure soil chemical, physical, biological and mineralogical
    properties from a distance of approximately less than 2 m above the soil surface
    [25]. A broad variety of on-the-go proximal sensing techniques has been applied
    ranging from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using Visible-Near-Infrared (VIS-NIR)
    [26,27] or Mid-Infrared (MIR) wavelengths [27], Gamma-Ray Radiometry (GRR) [28],
    Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [29], and Electrical Conductivity (EC) [30]. VIS-NIR
    and MIR can provide information of the top-soil on several soil properties (e.g.,
    soil organic carbon, texture, nitrogen content, pH) [15]. Viscarra Rossel et al.
    [27] compared the performance of different wavelength ranges using VIS, NIR and
    MIR. Prediction accuracy varied greatly depending on the soil property. GRR and
    EC provided subsurface information and for example the derived textural information
    could be adopted as a-priory variable to improve predictions based on VIS-NIR
    spectroscopy [31]. GPR also quantifies soil properties of the subsurface and especially
    is capable to provide information about soil moisture. Integration of different
    sensing techniques by selecting a complementary set of sensors, may improve the
    estimation of soil properties [32]. These so-called multi-sensor platforms [24]
    would allow increased confidence as independent measurements are made on the same
    soil in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Complementary to this,
    in 2010 Sinfield et al. [33] published a review on the current state of sensor
    technology for monitoring nitrate (N), phosphate (P), and potassium (K) status
    of the soil to optimize fertilizer production inputs. Other specific types of
    sensors are also able to detect the problem of soil compaction which causes many
    problems in crop production (e.g., decreased water storage and soil physical fertility).
    Hemmat and Adamchuk [23] gave a detailed classification of available sensors for
    measuring soil compaction. Wireless sensor networks for measuring soil properties
    had been mainly developed for soil water content and soil temperature [34]. Continuous
    in-situ sensor measurements would be able to provide real-time information on
    field conditions which can be used as a direct input for farm management systems.
    For example, Moghaddam et al. in 2010 [35] presented a smart wireless sensor web
    for optimal measurement of surface-to-depth profiles of soil moisture using in-situ
    sensors. The starting point was to develop a sparser but smarter network with
    an optimized measurement schedule in space and time which can provide soil moisture
    estimates by operating sensor scheduling and estimation strategies. Ritsema et
    al. in 2009 [36] presented an advanced approach with a communication protocol
    including data transfer to an end user web page which is applied for continuous
    monitoring of soil water contents at multiple depths. Finally, Sun et al. in 2009
    [37] have presented a solar-powered wireless cell that contained a water content
    sensor, two temperature sensors, an optical sensor, a communication module and
    a data-logger. Experimental results under varying weather conditions showed that
    the cell is promising to be used as a node of wireless network in agricultural
    fields. Real-time commercial proximal soil sensing systems have already been developed
    for various operations in crop production. In general these techniques are less
    accurate than laboratory analyses, but they improve the efficiency of soil data
    collection and provide the farmer spatial patterns of soil variation instead of
    only a few accurate measurements. In addition, by combining these soil patterns
    with observed yield patterns, stratification zones can be identified for spatially
    varying management [27]. Recent advances in image based sensing techniques showed
    the potential to map soil properties like soil organic matter from airborne [24,38]
    or spaceborne platforms [39]. Currently used, off-the-shelf soil moisture sensors,
    such tensiometers, electrical resistance sensors and dielectric sensor, are also
    relatively large, need soil-specific calibration and careful installation with
    good connection with the soil and are often wired making them impractical for
    agricultural fields [40]. The radio signal attenuation hinder data transfer from
    networks installed underground. However, wireless data transfer through the soil
    has developed fast in recent years [41–44]. Ritsema et al. [36] and Tiusanen [43]
    have reported good performance of underground soil sensor networks in their tests.
    The communication (at ∼868 MHz) through soil showed some problems, especially
    if distances between underground and aboveground nodes were longer. The tested
    distances were between 6–62 m and 30–150 m, when sensor depths varied between
    4–10 cm or 10–40 cm, correspondingly [9,36,43]. 2.1.2. Plant Protection Control
    of disease, insect pests, and weeds is an essential operation to gain a stable
    high yield of crops and high-quality products. To be able to destroy a weed or
    disease, it has to be first sensed or detected. Different sensing techniques are
    used to sense the position of plants and differentiate weeds in order to appropriately
    apply protection agents. These sensors and actuators are either attached to the
    tractor or are independent autonomous machines for this purpose. Spectral colour
    analysis techniques [45,46] and textural properties of leaves [47,48] have been
    employed to identify weeds. Gerhards and Christensen in 2003 [46] and Lamm et
    al. in 2002 [49] used the shapes of plants to differentiate between weeds and
    crops. After sensing the unwanted weed or disease, mechanical, chemical or thermal
    methods can be used to destroy these weeds. Slaughter et al. [50] reviewed different
    methods used for weed control. Rotating hoes and tine types of weed control actuators
    has been utilised for weed control [51–54]. As reviewed by McCarthy et al. [55],
    commercial weed control systems on the market include Photonic Detection System
    [56] that uses reflectance in the NIR wavebands to determine the spectral differences
    between weeds and the bare ground, the Weedseeker [57] which employs light emitting
    diodes to assess the ratios of red and NIR reflectances of weeds and background,
    and the Rees Equipment [58] that identifies weeds based on colour, basic shape
    and size properties using video image analysis. Also a tractor-mounted pendulum-meter
    which measures plant biomass of crop has been tested for controlling fungicide
    dosage in variable-rate application [59]. Lamm et al. in 2002 [49], Gerhards and
    Christensen in 2003 [60], Luck et al. in 2010 [61] used prototype precision chemical
    application system with microscopic or boom section control in a test of a robotic
    weed control systems to improve the precision of agent application. Available
    thermal methods for weed control use similar sensing but different types of actuators
    and mechanisms for weed control. Heisel [62] described in his research the use
    of non contact laser treatments methods for control of weeds. 2.1.3. Fertilising
    Considerable progress has been made in the use of proximal remote measurements
    with handheld and tractor mounted sensors for nutrient management in arable farming
    [63,64]. For these so-called near-sensing systems, different commercial devices
    are currently on the market (e.g., Yara N-sensor, Greenseeker, Cropcircle, Isaria)
    which measure reflectance in a small number of relatively broad spectral bands
    using their own active light-source. In an operational setting, the sensors are
    mounted on the tractor or the spraying boom and measurements are acquired when
    agricultural activities on the field are carried out [65]. This results in a regular
    point sampling of the field depending on the number of sensors and distance between
    them and the velocity of the mobile platform during acquisition. The output of
    near-sensing instruments consists either of more general vegetation indices like
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red-edge position (REP) or system
    specific indices that represent the relative difference in crop conditions. Based
    on this relation, variable-rate technology is developed for spraying and fertilization
    based on real-time sensor data acquisition [24]. Most studies focus on the use
    of near-sensing systems for optimization of nitrogen fertilization in arable crops
    like wheat [66,67], corn [65,68], potato [64] and cotton [69] but also for automated
    fertilizer application in tree crops [70]. For example, in 2006 Berntsen et al.
    [67] adopted the Yara N-sensor to target nitrogen fertilizer in fields of winter
    wheat. Their results showed that better relationships between sensor measurements
    and grain yield could be achieved when improved sensors would be able to describe
    additional crop features (e.g., LAI and canopy characteristics) or soil properties
    (e.g., soil organic matter, water content). An inter-comparison study by Tremblay
    et al. in 2009 [65] showed that although both commercial sensors (Greenseeker
    and Yara N-sensor) were capable of characterizing differences in crop growth resulting
    from variation in nitrogen status, marked differences between sensors were observed
    in NDVI development over the growing season. The studies indicated that integration
    of near-sensing instruments or the combined use of near-sensing systems with remote
    sensing data sources still require further improvement [63]. In addition, recently
    published vegetation indices like the Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve (NAOC)
    [71] and the Double-peak Canopy Nitrogen Index (DCNI) [72] combined with biomass
    indices (e.g., weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) [73] showed promising
    results to assess crop nitrogen status. To improve site-specific nitrogen management,
    plant growth models require accurate information on the whole cropping system,
    including the crop nitrogen status, and supply and losses from the soil with high
    temporal and spatial resolution [74]. 2.1.4. Irrigation Efficient irrigation management
    needs information on when and where to irrigate and how much water to apply. Sensor
    information on soil characteristics, mostly soil moisture and temperature, can
    be utilised in deciding timing and amount water applied as well as in validating
    irrigation efficiency. Also indirect sensor measurement on crop stress has been
    developed for irrigation practises [40,75]. The potential of sensor technology
    for irrigated agriculture has been studied since mid 80s [76,77]. Since then rapid
    development of communication technologies has replaced wired soil conditions monitoring
    systems with wireless systems. In Spain such an experimental system for monitoring
    soil, weather and irrigation water was developed for precision horticulture. The
    system provided more comprehensive data in both space and time compared to the
    traditional systems based on manual measurement with portable device. The wireless
    techniques made systems faster to deploy and provide flexibility while challenges
    were found in costs of the sensors, lack of experienced staff and in power supply
    [78]. Holler presented [79] a ten-node soil moisture and temperature monitoring
    network for managing regulated deficit irrigation in Californian vineyards. They
    used inexpensive off-the-shelf sensors for optimizing irrigation duration and
    intervals and for monitoring water sources and irrigation system operation (e.g.,
    line pressure, tank filling). The use of sensor data seemed beneficial as the
    sensor network was extended to two adjacent vineyards. Benefits were gained from
    improved grape quality and yield and from savings in water use, pumping energy,
    and labour and repair costs. In conventional irrigation, fields are managed uniformly
    both in terms of water application depth and timing, which may results in over-
    or under-irrigation. Site-specific irrigation management takes into account spatial
    variation by using management zones that are treated individually [80]. Vellidis
    et al. [81] presented an irrigation scheduling application based on soil moisture
    and temperature sensors. Sensor data was used to define irrigation zones, timing
    of irrigation and amount of water to apply. The systems used RFID technology in
    transmitting monitoring data which had an advantage of decreasing cost and power
    use by the transmitting network. They also developed variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) system retrofit package that is suitable for most existing pivots to allow
    varying water application amounts. The VRI system was also commercialised in United
    States [81,82]. Control of irrigation system on basis of sensor measurements requires
    wireless real-time communication. Automated irrigation system should also be able
    to allow a variety of control inputs (also sensor inputs), to control individual
    nozzles and be aware of its location to optimise amount of water applied [81,83,84].
    Decision support software for the control of linear-move irrigation based on near
    real-time sensor networks was described by Kim and Evans in 2009 [84]. The experimental
    system employed wireless sensor network of soil moisture monitoring, and used
    sensor data to adjust irrigation and nozzle sequencing for performing site-specific
    irrigation. The location of irrigation machine was also monitored and the system
    was adaptable for different crop designs, irrigation patterns and field locations.
    Chavez et al. [83,85] recently described an automated control system for lateral-move
    irrigation systems. It controlled on/off time of each nozzle to create spatially
    variable water application rates. The system worked at 1-min resolution and integrated
    in-situ soil moisture sensor data, remote sensing maps with thermal infrared readings,
    spatial information on field characteristics and static information of crop water
    use to automatically provide a map for controlling irrigation task and providing
    feedback on tasks’ success. Irrigation management posed requirements for sensor
    and communication technology: sensors should be easy to use and install, expenses
    of sensors be low, power-use of instruments and communication be low and data
    representativeness and reliability be at reasonable level. Interoperability of
    sensors and sensor networks with irrigation control systems also need development
    [84]. The benefits of sensor measurements were obtained by increased efficiency
    of water use [83]. There is also evidence that site-specific irrigation can increase
    amount and quality of yields for crops that are sensitive to soil water availability
    such as potato. However, increase in income may not cover the costs of monitoring
    and improved irrigation systems [80]. Site-specific irrigation had also lowered
    risks of plant diseases and environmental damages, such as nutrient leaching and
    soil compaction [40,80,84]. For site-specific irrigation, as any precision agriculture
    technique, correct modelling of spatial variability (of soil moisture) is critical,
    otherwise uniform application rate may be more approved than variable rate applications
    [75]. Remote sensing was also studied in mapping crop water status. Thermal imagery
    provides spatial data on surface temperature which was used to estimate crop water
    status. The review of recent remote sensing studies on crop water status is given
    by Lee et al. in 2010 [14]. 2.1.5. Harvesting Yield sensing and mapping during
    grain harvesting has been extensively studied and is also widely adopted practise.
    Yield monitor systems usually incorporate data from a yield sensor, a moisture
    sensor, a ground speed sensor, a cut width sensor, an elevator speed sensor, and
    a differential global positioning system (DGPS) receiver to relate sensed grain
    yield to location [86]. Various techniques for on-the-go yield sensing were described
    in review articles by Arslan et al. [86] and Reyns [87]. Reyns [87] separated
    mountable grain yield sensors in four groups: Mass flow measurements, volume flow
    measurements, impact sensors and indirect methods, where indirect methods includes
    radiometric and capacitive methods. Reyns [87] gave a detailed overview of published
    research on different sensors as well as an overview of commercial sensors on
    the market. Most major agricultural equipment companies now provide optional yield-mapping
    systems for their combine harvesters. A fair amount of studies have been conducted
    to assess the accuracy of yield measurement and yield mapping (see [86,88,89]
    and references therein). In addition to crop yield, also sensing of crop quality
    has been developed. For grain crops, these applications typically give information
    on crop moisture and protein content. In commercial applications, grain protein
    content monitoring is carried out with sensors based on either Near-Infrared Transmittance
    (NIT) on stationary grain samples (Cropscan 2000H and Zeltex Accuharvest) or NIR
    technology measuring from continuous flow of harvested grain (The ProSpectra)
    [90]. Taylor et al. [91] tested on-harvester grain protein and moisture sensing
    using NIT technology (Zeltex AccuHarvest). They reported coherent output and strong
    indication that observed patterns are real, and pointed out that local calibration
    is needed for the sensor. Whelan et al. [90] studied use of the same harvester-mounted
    on-the-go sensor to assess wheat grain protein concentration, grain yield and
    their site-specific variation. With calibration to local (Australian) crops, they
    managed to get consistent estimation of protein level with measurement precision
    better than 0.5%, over a large grain protein content range. Similar levels of
    accuracy were reported by Long et al. [92] as they were using NIR reflectance
    spectrometer (ProSpectra Grain Analyzer) to measure wheat protein content in a
    moving grain stream. On-the-go measurement of grain quality in harvesters could
    also allow separation of crop into quality classes, and thus bring competitive
    advantage if there are non-linearity’s in the payments of quality premium [91,93].
    Measuring quality may also help explain the variation in crop yield [87], enable
    nitrogen fertilizer management, and support environmental auditing at the within-field
    scale [89]. Crop quality sensing was regarded as one of the future trends in precision
    farming [93–95]. Research on sensing and yield mapping applications for forage
    crop harvesting has been lesser in amount. Some recent examples are [96] and [97].
    Lee et al. [97,98] developed a wagon-based real-time yield monitoring system that
    was successfully implemented in a silage corn field. The system used moisture
    sensors, DGPS receiver, load cells, and Bluetooth modules for wireless data transmission.
    In addition to yield and crop quality monitoring, emphasis of the research is
    on how to interprete yield maps, and convert them into actionable data such as
    management plans [99,100]. While harvesting of grain and forage crops utilized
    on-the-go sensors, in viticulture sensor network applications were emerging. However,
    full-scale decision support systems (DSS) that could convert sensor monitoring
    data into decision support on harvest still remains a challenge, also in viticulture
    [101]. Precision viticulture has to deal with the existence of variability of
    grape yield and quality, often with more financial importance on quality. Matese
    et al. [102] presented a sensor network solution for precision viticulture that
    was set up on four experimental vineyards in Tuscany, Italy. The system included
    a base agro-meteorological station as a Master Unit, and a series (10) of peripheral
    wireless nodes (slave units) located in the vineyard that monitored air, grape,
    leaf, and soil temperatures, soil water potential, grape radiation, leaf wetness
    and wind speed. The Master Unit utilized wireless technology for data communication
    and transmission with the slave units and remote central server. The system was
    originally developed to monitor agro-meteorological parameters and environmental
    conditions in different management practices, to see how they influence grape
    quality. The network was seen to be flexible and customizable, and it was also
    possible to set an alarm threshold for agro-meteorological conditions such as
    frost risk [10] or drought [81], or weather conditions leading to increased pathogen
    risks [103] and thus provide additional, actionable data to the farmer. Burrell
    et al. [104] explored usability of sensor networks in terms of user needs, equipment
    capabilities, and environmental conditions for a vineyard in Oregon, USA. In the
    study they considered several optional system architectures, and carried out a
    trial installation of 18 monitoring motes capable of in-network processing of
    data, and using radio frequencies for data transmission. It was concluded that
    even if sensor networks provide valuable information on the optimal timing of
    harvest, the decision of actual harvest time should not be fully automated, mainly
    because it is often a subjective and social-economically-based decision. 2.1.6.
    Fleet Management and Control Fleet management and control Systems (FMS) encompasses
    the management of a company’s mobile vehicles properties, which includes the purchase,
    maintenance, inventory, disposal and work scheduling of these vehicles. Fleet
    Management, which became widely adapted in industrial domains from the end of
    the 1980s, provides added value for an enterprise or organization by improving
    efficiency and productivity of mobile vehicles [105,106]. Just as has happened
    in the transportation industry, agricultural production has undergone significant
    changes to embrace large farms with multiple machinery and chains that require
    more efficient management. Furthermore, modern agriculture machinery is advanced
    and equipped with various smart sensors some of which are wirelessly networked
    [107]. Fleet management in agricultural crop production consists of two main components
    a transport telematics; located on the vehicle, which serves and receives network
    information, and a software application [108]. The software application can be
    used via local wireless networks or through the internet to provide access to
    the fleet to be managed [109]. The transport telematics consists of a positioning
    system; a key component for fleet management, and a series of networked sensor
    nodes that enable process and environment monitoring [18]. Large and intensive
    crop production farms invest heavily in machinery; therefore, their usage and
    maintenance must be efficiently planned and implemented. For efficient management
    of the fleet, enterprises need information about where their mobile vehicles are,
    how they are operating, and in which environment they are operating. As the agricultural
    machinery has become complex and diverse, the International Standards Organization
    has charged the Technical Committee 23 (ISO/TC23/SC19/WG5) with standardizing
    wireless communication amongst agricultural equipments. Fleet management and implement
    synchronizations are one of the priorities in the standardization work. Within
    this scope, fleet management with WSN in agricultural crop applications a can
    be classified into two main groups: firstly plant production vehicles and equipment,
    and secondly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Plant production vehicles and equipment
    perform field operations such as soil manipulation, planting, fertilizer and disease
    control applications, and crop harvesting. UAV’s monitor crops and environmental
    conditions of the crop production system. For plant production vehicles and equipment,
    recent publications have reported the trends in the management and control of
    fleet in farming operation which involve single or multi-machinery systems of
    combine harvesters, self-propelled, tractor-trailer units and one or more crop
    transport units. Guo and Zhang [110] presented in 2005 a wireless data fusion
    system that automatically collected and processed operational data from agricultural
    machinery in order to provide real-time support for precision farming tasks. The
    system provided transparent data for management and decision support functions
    to crop producers by wirelessly integrating a machinery-based sensing unit and
    an office-based data processing unit. The machinery-based unit collects the machine
    position and altitude data, the office-based unit performs data fusion to accurately
    estimate the machine position, and the wireless data-link transmits the data between
    the machinery- and the office-based units. Field tests indicate that this system
    can collect field data from the operating machinery and wirelessly send the raw
    data to a data-processing centre to acquire accurate machinery positioning data
    at a sampling rate of 50 Hz. Apart from research literature and prototyped trials,
    major agricultural machinery companies are becoming key actors in fleet management
    in agriculture. Examples include Claas group’s “Agro-Combine online” and the “Claas
    Telematics” [111] or John Deere’s “JDLink”. For unmanned aerial vehicles, Techy
    et al. [112] described the use of a control strategy (coordination via speed modulation)
    to synchronize two autonomous fleet UAVs during aerobiological sampling of the
    potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora Infestans. The UAVs shared position
    coordinates via a wireless mesh network and modulated their speeds so that they
    were properly phased within their sampling orbits. Their report was one of the
    first using an autonomous UAV coordination for aerobiological sampling of a plant
    pathogen in the lower atmosphere. Göktogán et al. [113] also presented a novel
    application of an autonomous Rotary-Wing Unmanned Air Vehicle (RUAV) as a cost-effective
    tool for the surveillance and management of aquatic weeds. The presented system
    locates and identifies weeds on inaccessible locations. The RUAV was equipped
    with low-cost sensor suites and various weed detection algorithms. In order to
    provide the weed control spraying and treatment of the aquatic weeds the RUAV
    is also fitted with a spray mechanism. The system has been demonstrated over inaccessible
    weed infested aquatic habitats. Hunt et al. [114] also remotely controlled and
    monitored a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by acquiring digital color-infrared
    photographs from a single 12-megapixel camera without an internal hot-mirror filter
    but with a red-light-blocking filter in front of the lens, resulting in NIR, green
    and blue images. The UAV-camera system was tested over two variably-fertilized
    fields of winter wheat and the authors found a good correlation between leaf area
    index and the green normalized difference vegetation index. In their research
    Huang et al. [115] presented an overview on the development of three UAVs for
    crop production management. The remote monitoring of the UAV’s were also discussed.
    They presented an ultra low volume sprayer for a UAV helicopter. Two other UAVs,
    one helicopter and one fix-wing airplane, were evaluated for low-altitude remote
    sensing over crop fields. The integration of the spray technology and the remote
    sensing technology on the UAV systems provided a great potential to identify crop
    stresses and hence spray crop production and protection materials at different
    rates over small crop fields to realize highly accurate site-specific crop production
    management. Lelong et al. [116] focused on the use of a combination of simple
    digital photographic cameras with spectral filters, designed to provide multispectral
    images in the VIS-NIR domains in light-weight UAV for remote sensing for precision
    farming. Successful tests were performed on ten varieties of wheat, grown in trial
    micro-plots in Southwest France. 2.2. Use Cases We present two cases of using
    sensor measurements in agricultural applications in detail and conclude with the
    lessons learnt during sensor network deployment and maintenance as well as application
    development. 2.2.1. Precision Farming of Potatoes in The Netherlands In crop production,
    nitrogen is most frequently the limiting nutrient and is needed by most crops
    at higher quantities than other nutrients. Optimal nitrogen supply is essential
    to secure abundant yield with high quality. For example for potato, which has
    a relatively low nitrogen use efficiency (50–60%) due to its naturally shallow
    and poorly developed root system, insufficient nitrogen exhibits yield while excessive
    nitrogen applications can reduce both yield quantity and quality [64]. Over the
    last decade, significant progress has been made in sensing methods to detect and
    diagnose crop nitrogen status for precision agriculture applications. This refers
    to remote sensing based methods from spaceborne or airborne platforms which are
    the basis for operational services like Mijnakker in the Netherlands ( www.mijnakker.nl)
    and GEOSYS in France ( www.geosys.com), but also includes the use of handheld
    and tractor mounted near-sensing (or ground-based) sensors for which a range of
    commercial devices (e.g., Yara N-sensor, Greenseeker, Cropcircle, Isaria) are
    currently available on the market. To investigate the application of near sensing
    instruments for fertility management in potato, a field study was conducted on
    an arable farm in the south of The Netherlands. The objective of the study was
    to investigate to which extent tractor mounted near-sensing instruments like Greenseeker
    (GS) are able to detect and monitor differences in fertility management practices
    in a potato crop. In addition, the complementary use of optical sensors and data
    from sensor networks to diagnose potato crop status over the growing season was
    evaluated. The GS sensor measures crop reflectance using an integrated LED emitting
    light in the red (656 nm) and NIR (774 nm) band from which the well-known NDVI
    can be calculated. Six GS sensors were mounted on the spraying beam behind the
    tractor resulting in a regular point sampling of the field depending on the velocity
    during acquisition. Sensor measurements were acquired during regular agricultural
    management activities (e.g., fungicide application) resulting in a frequency of
    11 measurements over the growing season of 2009. In addition, continuous meteorological
    data (e.g., temperature, rainfall) were available from an on-farm sensor network
    which was also used as input for a decision support system to optimize use and
    timing of fungicide applications to mitigate the risk of potato late blight disease
    development. A simple experiment was set-up to track potato crop development over
    the growing season and to evaluate effects of weather on crop development. One
    parcel was split in two parts and planting dates were varied with early planting
    in the western part (April 25, 2009) and later in the eastern part (May 13, 2009).
    In addition, soil conditions (e.g., organic matter, moisture) within the parcel
    were spatially varying. Figure 1 shows the development of NDVI as an indicator
    for vegetation biomass measured with the GS sensor over the growing season for
    five spatially varying locations within the parcel. The composite image in the
    inset of Figure 1 which combines the spatial distribution of three NDVI observations
    over the growing season clearly detects the spatial variation in potato crop status
    caused by the difference in planting date and the inherent soil variability. Figure
    1. Development of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from time-series
    of measurements with Greenseeker sensor in potato parcel and comparison with rainfall
    data from nearby meteorological sensor network. The timing of agricultural management
    practices (e.g., irrigation and fertilization) is also indicated in the figure.
    The inset shows the sample locations for the Greenseeker sensor within the parcel.
    The variation in colours represent a composite image indicating NDVI at different
    stages over the growing season: red: 13 June; green: 9 July; blue: 29 July 2009.
    Additionally to the spatial variation, also the temporal development of the crop
    varied significantly at different positions within the field (Figure 1). A clear
    difference can be observed between S1, S2 and S3 (early planting) and S4 and S5
    (late planting) in NDVI development where the first samples reach a NDVI saturation
    level of 0.85 around mid June and the latter mid July. However, for all locations
    a clear reduction of NDVI can be observed between mid and end of June. Comparison
    with rainfall data from the meteorological sensor network shows that this overlaps
    with a period with no rainfall. Based on this information, the farmer decided
    to apply irrigation for the whole parcel which resulted in a quick recover of
    the crop as shown by the increasing NDVI. Although some effect of nitrogen fertilization
    can be observed after the application of mid July especially for S4 and S5, the
    detection and diagnosis of nitrogen status of the potato crop needs further improvement.
    Firstly, by the use of optical vegetation indices (e.g., red-edge position) which
    use spectral bands related to the crop nitrogen status, and secondly, by analyzing
    detailed multi-temporal sensor measurements [74]. The latter would require the
    integration of remote sensing and (mobile) near-sensing measurements to achieve
    the best possible consistent high-frequency time-series for an improved continuous
    detection of crop status. The results of this case-study indicated that complementary
    application of optical sensors and sensor network is promising to optimize management
    activities and the usage of (natural) resources in arable farming. As the modern
    farmer requires near-real-time and ready-to-use information to drive management
    decisions and it is anticipated that sensor costs will decrease considerably over
    the coming decade, the next critical step is to improve the quality of sensor
    measurements in precision agriculture. Therefore, based on the presented case
    study and scientific literature, the following aspects would need development:
    Due to different reasons the timeliness of sensor data is still limiting: e.g.,
    remote sensing is weather and satellite dependent and near-sensing is dependent
    on management operations; Currently available sensors and related services are
    mostly based on one or a limited number of sensor data streams while a combination
    of sensors will be required to detect and diagnose processes within the soil-cropping
    system. This will require innovative data analysis methods to take advantage of
    complementary sensor data streams; Established relations between sensor measurements
    and crop-growth, -composition and -yield need improvement. For instance by combining
    existing databases and developing more flexible diagnosis methods which are fitted
    to management information needs of the individual farmer; The availability of
    directly useable spraying maps and information for site-specific management derived
    from sensor measurements needs improvement. Therefore, new concepts of information
    organization are required which take advantage of the increasing opportunities
    for web-based data processing (e.g., cloud computing) and wireless communication
    between sensors and devices. 2.2.2. Applications of the SoilWeather Sensor Network
    in Finland Testing and development of agricultural forecast models and automating
    the use of sensor data in agricultural applications calls for reliable sensor
    measurements that can capture both temporal and spatial variation in the area
    of interest. Several application pilots were carried out using Finnish, large-scale
    (2,000 km2) wireless sensor network, called SoilWeather. The network was established
    in Southern Finland during the years 2007 and 2008 to support development of environmental
    monitoring, agricultural forecast services and precision farming, and also to
    provide local farmers timely information on local weather parameters. SoilWeather
    wireless sensor network (WSN) monitors local weather parameters (air temperature,
    humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction), soil moisture and parameters
    for ditch and river water (turbidity and nitrate concentration) at a frequency
    of 15–60 min (Table 1, Figure 2). The nodes of the network (∼70) are mostly compact
    weather stations (a-Weather) that are located in the fields of private farms.
    GSM network is used in transferring data from nodes to database. Data is available
    near-real time (time lag 1 h in maximum) at customized web services. Every 24
    h, the data is validated by simple data quality algorithms flagging missing data
    and erroneous data (such as measurements outside of defined ranges). Maintenance
    of SoilWeather WSN measuring stations is carried out at a regular basis (twice
    a year) and according to the alerts from quality control system. Common maintenance
    tasks are replacement of batteries or broken parts and manual cleaning of the
    sensor probes. Especially the aquatic sensors require frequent manual cleaning
    due to contamination during the growing season, even though the sensors are equipped
    with automatic cleaning systems based either on a mechanical wiper or air pressure.
    SoilWeather WSN is described in detail by Kotamäki et al. [117]. Figure 2. Photographs
    of the devices used in SoilWeather WSN: (A) the spectrometer used in measuring
    water turbidity and nitrate concentration; (B) Turbidity sensor; and (C) weather
    station (Photographs: Lippo Sundberg, MTT Agrifood Research Finland). Table 1.
    Variables measured and sensors used in SoilWeather WSN. SoilWeather WSN serves
    as platform for research and application development including agricultural application
    for farmers, nutrient leaching studies from agricultural land to water system
    and retention efficiency studies of constructed wetland [117]. Here we focus agricultural
    applications that can improve crop production processes at farm level, and thus
    emphasis is on weather and soil measurements instead of water measurements. To
    demonstrate the usability of local sensor measurement in agricultural decision
    support, we carried out a plant protection forecast pilot for potato blight, white
    mould of turnip seeds and three leaf blotch diseases (glume blotch and tanspot
    for wheat and net blotch for barley). In potato blight application, timing of
    the spraying operation was supported by estimates for onset and spreading of potato
    blight We employed the complex LB2004 model at Web-blight warning service ( www.euroblight.net)
    [118,119] in which an interface was built to operate with SoilWeather sensor data
    (air temperature and humidity). Additionally, potato blight risk was assessed
    by a simple model that uses only temperature and relative humidity measured locally
    in farms. This model was tested for 11 potato fields in SoilWeather WSN. The prevention
    need for white mould of turnip seeds was estimated by a simple decision rule:
    if the soil is continuously moist (precipitation is ∼30 mm) in three week time
    period before the flowering of turnip seed, prevention against white mould is
    needed [117]. The crop disease prognosis for wheat and barley provides a daily
    estimate for accumulated risk for infection. Prognosis is based on the weather
    data from SoilWeather WSN (temperature, humidity and rainfall) and cultivation
    data from FMIS on sowing, cultivation history, tillage and cultivar. Web-based
    FMIS can access SoilWeather WSN database. The prognosis model was verified by
    observations made in 18 farms. The farmer was alerted when risk level exceeded
    the predetermined limit. For cases where a farm does not have an own local weather
    station, spatial coverage was arranged by using national weather data. Plans to
    productize the application as a part of a commercial WebWisu FMIS exist. A grass
    harvesting time model and service application (Artturi, https://portal.mtt.fi/portal/page/portal/Artturi/artturi_web_service)
    is operational with national weather data and available for farmers. The empirical
    model estimates concentration of digestible organic matter of forage based on
    effective temperature sum. In the context of SoilWeather WSN, research on this
    application is focused on the possible additional value gained from higher spatial
    or temporal frequency from the sensor data. Automated use of local weather parameters
    was also piloted in agricultural on-field operations. In the pilot, local weather
    information was used as decision support for farmer to optimize pesticide spraying
    task by taking into account wind drift of the agent and safe time for spraying.
    A prototype task controller for executing precision spraying tasks was developed
    and data transfer between SoilWeather database, FMIS and a field vehicle was demonstrated.
    In addition to other relevant information such as sprayer information and GPS
    location, the task controller of a work set provides the farmer information on
    weather parameters from local weather station of SoilWeather, and rainfall forecast
    for next three hours. The experiences gained from building up the sensor network
    and during four years of operation has highlighted the value of sensor data, but
    also revealed that resources have to be allocated for the maintenance of sensors
    and data quality control. The added value was gained more on temporal and spatial
    resolutions, which made it possible to rapidly analyse or observe highly variable
    phenomena, such as nutrient leaching peaks, and integrate local measurement data
    (e.g., farm weather station) to agricultural models and with work-sets. In SoilWeather
    WSN, running costs include repair of the devices, communication network costs
    (SMS messages), data service cost, and work time and travel costs used for maintenance
    and cleaning. Even if actual costs of sensor devices are decreasing, it should
    be emphasized that greater part of overall costs accumulates from maintenance
    of network, thereby creating the need for long-term financing. The SoilWeather
    WSN produces about 30,000 measurements daily. With this rate of incoming data,
    the data quality control need to be automated as far as possible, but still some
    expert knowledge and manual measurements are needed to keep track on the need
    for maintenance and overall quality of the measurements. Variation in data quality
    needs also to be taken into account in the development of automated applications.
    Software applications have to deal with temporal gaps in the data stream e.g.,
    due to communication network breakdowns, and with spatially irregular gaps as
    sensor networks are still relatively rare. In the developed plant protection forecasts,
    national weather data was used when no local sensor data was available. This highlights
    the need for interoperability between data sources and standardised interfaces
    enabling integration of different data sources for applications. Sensors also
    provide erroneous measurements e.g., due to the contamination of sensors, of which
    most should be identified by data quality algorithms. Although data quality algorithms
    need to be developed further, there is also a challenge of communicating data
    quality to the end users. 3. User Requirements Even if research on sensors and
    sensor networks in agriculture covers a wide spectrum of applications, they only
    have real potential to become operational applications when they provide economical
    or other benefits for users, such as decreased work load for farmer or environmental
    effects of crop production. In crop production, added-value from sensors and sensor
    networks was expected to be gained by increased efficiency in use of water, agrochemicals,
    nutrients and farm vehicles and by improved yield both in quantity and quality
    resulting to benefits both for farmer and environment. All the sensor types, in-situ
    sensors, near-sensing and remote sensing were employed, and several commercial
    sensor products were available. Sensor technology was used more in specialty crop
    production, such as vegetables, fruits and grapes, than in field production. The
    reason is that in specialized crop production, added value is higher, which makes
    investments in sensor technology economically beneficial. Based on the literature
    review and our own experience from the use cases we have identified eight user
    requirements for successful deployment of sensor technology especially of sensor
    networks. 3.1. Ease of Deployment and Maintenance of Sensors Easy installation
    and use of sensors was considered an important issue for operational and wide-spread
    applications. Whereas sensors and networks were considered to be flexible and
    suitable for many purposes and locations, technical expertise needed in deployment
    and use was seen as drawback. At the moment plug-and-play sensors are only limitedly
    available. In traditional farming, many tasks in crop production processes can
    be carried out by unskilled labour. Automation and use of sensors may decrease
    these job vacancies while creating demands for higher-skilled and more specialised
    workers [14]. The lack of technical expertise and support for farms was often
    raised as one of the major challenges in taking sensor technology into operational
    use in farms. Several technical solutions such as solar energy harvesting, automatic
    cleaning systems, development in materials (e.g., antifouling materials), automatic
    calibration and remote control of sensors has been developed to decrease maintenance
    efforts, yet still all the sensors need some amount of maintenance. Deployment
    and maintenance may also be outsourced so that installation and maintenance comes
    along with the measurement service. However an arranged maintenance causes costs
    and requires resources over the measuring time-span. In some cases, field work
    may increase compared to the traditional sample based analysis [2,117,120], but
    on the other hand the obtained level of information is higher. Power supply was
    commonly seen as a main bottleneck in literature, and thus, solutions was searched
    to either decrease sensor energy use or increase their energy use efficiency by
    improving battery technology or by solar harvesting systems [37]. In addition,
    energy use of sensor nodes was commonly improved by limiting communication distances
    or measuring frequencies and by activating the sleep mode of sensors when no measuring
    needs exists. 3.2. Sensor and Network Reliability Sensor nodes need to be durable
    and rugged for varying weather conditions, in some cases under dirty and vibrating
    field vehicle conditions, and against animal disturbance and destruction. This
    demands for a good design and casings for sensor nodes, but also allowance for
    maintenance and cleaning of sensor devices. Sensors work reliably only if they
    are correctly maintained. Sensor networks were mostly wireless systems with real-time
    or near real-time data transfer via radio, Wi-fi, ZigBee, Bluetooth or 3G mobile
    phone networks. The optimal data transfer solution needs to be considered case
    by case considering issues like power consumption, network topology, number of
    nodes, sensor and data type, data transmittance distances and need for extenditibility.
    The benefits and challenges of these technologies has been widely discussed in
    existing reviews [17,18]. Additionally RFID based communication was tested in
    an irrigation application [81]. Wireless communication made devices easier to
    install and less demanding for measuring sites. It also decreased costs because
    wires were not needed. However, coverage of wireless networks is still low in
    many rural areas [14]. Reliability of communication has often been questioned,
    but in the application review it did not appear to be a major bottleneck (keeping
    in mind that most applications were short-term experiments), although some problematic
    experiences have been reported [121]. Many reviewed cases were prepared for packet
    loss or failures in communication connection e.g., by employing diagnostic software
    for observing problems or alternative routing possibilities for sending measurements.
    3.3. Data Correctness Data quality can be considered as one of the most critical
    challenges related to sensors applications and networks [122], and especially
    when data is used in decision making or, moreover in automated processing e.g.,
    on-the-go variable rate application. Sensors may produce erroneous measurements
    or there may be gaps in data streams, e.g., due to sensor, software or communication
    network failure. Due to changing natural conditions such as high dynamics of ambient
    light, field-based sensors will not provide accuracy similar to conventional,
    laboratory based methods, but may provide spatial and temporal coverage and timelines
    that cannot be obtained by conventional methods e.g., on soil properties [23].
    The spatial accuracy of sensor data as well as GPS location field vehicle is critical
    for site-specific applications: in case of spatial inaccuracy, tendencies are
    that it is cost-efficient to apply equal levels of nutrients or chemicals [75].
    Data quality is a result of several aspects: selection of appropriate measuring
    sites and sensors, proper deployment, careful sensor calibration and maintenance,
    and reliable data transfer and management. Some of the challenges are purely technological,
    e.g., data transfer, whereas others are more related resources, skills or ways
    of action. Limited data quality due to loss of calibration accuracy could be solved
    by automated calibration of sensors [123]. However, focus should also put on selection
    of appropriate sensors and careful deployment in representative sites considering
    parameters measured. Sensor observations vary in quality, which has to be taken
    into account in data delivery e.g., by specifying quality flags for observations.
    Although data quality algorithms to flag erroneous (or missing) observations were
    well-developed in meteorological networks, these DQ tools were less frequently
    applied to sensor networks in other domains. However, for end-users, being a farmer,
    a model or a machine, it is critical that data quality is communicated. 3.4. Data
    Amount Continuous data acquisition in sensor networks results in fast accumulating
    amounts of data which poses a challenge to data management. One of the solutions
    to limit data amount was in-situ processing or filtering of data, in particular
    when data sets were very large or data is acquired with high frequency. In the
    cases of on-the-go sensing and applications from mobile vehicles like tractors,
    in-situ processing were a requirement. However, this will result in an increase
    of energy consumption which often is not problematic for moving vehicles but could
    be a limitation for wireless sensor networks. Data amount was also limited by
    timing measurements to events. Thus, most sensor nodes of the network were turned
    off until something interesting was observed. Sensor data availability is also
    supposed to increase due to changes in data policies and in ways of collecting
    and sharing data. Larger amount of data available recalls tools for finding data,
    and for data analysis e.g., by data mining and fusion. 3.5. Interoperability and
    Standardization The availability of equipment with more computing power makes
    it possible to utilize various sensing techniques such as global positioning systems
    (GPS), machine vision, weather sensors, dead-reckoning sensors, laser-based sensors,
    inertial sensors and geomagnetic direction sensors for applications in agriculture.
    Heterogeneity of sensors poses also many challenges for data integration and interoperability
    of systems: data of wide spectrum of variables is generated in various formats
    and resolutions by sensors using different measuring technologies and standards.
    Moreover, data is transferred between various hardware, software and organizations,
    such as FMIS, farm machinery and vehicles, and external web services, resulting
    in incompatibilities [124]. In order to widely apply sensor technologies in agriculture,
    there is the need for standardizing sensor communication and data produced. Interoperability,
    data transfer and data harmonization are the major problems to be addressed for
    enabling easy data transfer between sensors, agricultural machines and the agricultural
    supply chain network, although some progress had been made in recent years. For
    crop production machines, the ISOBUS standard adresseses data exchange and compatibility
    between hardware systems for crop production in agriculture. ISO standard ISO
    11783 specifies the data BUS communication standard between the tractor and implementation
    chain. However, the integration of different networks from external intelligent
    systems such as environmental sensors amongst others is still not widely available
    [125]. European Union’s (EU) INSPIRE directive aims to harmonize European spatial
    data infrastructure. This will enable the sharing of environmental spatial information
    among public sector organisations and better facilitate public access to spatial
    information across Europe [126]. Geography Markup Language (GML) has also been
    proposed to serve as a good basis for standardising data formats for precision
    agriculture [18]. OGC’s standardized web services and interfaces are commonly
    recognised and the following have high relevance in agriculture: WMS (Web map
    service), WFS[-T] (Web feature service [transactional]), WCS (Web coverage service),
    WPS (Web processing service), GML (Geographic markup language), ISO 19115 (Metadata
    standard for geographic data sets), SFS (Simple features specification) and CTS
    (Coordinate transformation service) [127]. Steinberger et al. [128] and Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. [18] demonstrated this with the acquisition of agricultural process data
    using ISO 11783 equipped tractor in ISOBUS XML form, transfering the data to a
    Farm Management Information System, converting the data to AgroXML form with GPS
    and open web services based on OGC standards. 3.6. Temporal and Spatial Resolution
    High spatial and temporal resolution is a well recognized advantage of in-situ
    sensor data. Development of applications was clearly focused on applications that
    are time-critical and benefit from high measurement frequency or real-time data
    transfer like alerting services for irrigation or plant protection. High measuring
    and data transfer frequency enabled to react to rapid or unexpected events, to
    improve timing of practices e.g., initiate frost prevention and automated adjustment
    of field vehicles according to the changing conditions. When considering in-situ
    sensor networks, high spatial resolution was mainly obtained for small-area applications.
    For example, few parcels may be highly instrumented for analysing soil moisture.
    Thus, coverage of high-frequency in-situ sensor networks was relatively low. A
    better spatial resolution and coverage was obtained by airborne or tractor based
    sensing. The spatial accuracy of remote sensing data as well as GPS location of
    field vehicles was critical for site-specific applications. Collection of location
    information in constant intervals from mobile vehicles can cause difficulties.
    Optimal spatial and temporal resolution and coverage of sensing are in relation
    to spatial variation of measured parameter, scale of application and sensing method.
    However, they also influence sensor power consumption, communication solutions
    selected and costs of measuring. 3.7. Costs of Sensing Costs of sensor networks
    were reported often, but only for devices, not for operation. Sensing costs consists
    of investment to equipments, data transfer, network maintenance (including cleaning,
    spare parts, calibration) and possibly data services. The costs of sensors are
    decreasing when use of nodes increases and mass production is realized. Technological
    development is also believed to decrease maintenance need and costs. At the moment,
    it was considered to be an obstacle that limits the use of sensor technology for
    small area applications or in testbeds. 3.8. Access to Data and Applications Most
    of the reviewed applications were made available by Internet giving the flexibility
    to monitor and manage farm activities, and connect to external services or data
    sources, such as weather forecasts, plant protection prognosis and to control
    their own sensors. Moreover, up-to-date information is actively offered to the
    farmers, e.g., in the forms of alerts. The possibilities of standardized web services
    were commonly recognized, and because sensors mostly produce spatial data, open
    geospatial web services were considered especially interesting. Integration of
    agricultural sensor networks to SWE is still untested, but interesting data such
    as aerial photos has been made available through WMS interfaces [124]. Access
    to data can also be considered from the viewpoint of the customers, food chain
    and authorities. Automatic measuring and web services enable to acquire and share
    information on how food is produced. The proof on responsibility of food production
    and traceability of food products may also offer economical benefits to the farmer,
    if customers or food industry are willing to pay more on products or raw material
    which is produced in a responsible way. Farm management data is sensitive, and
    farmers have to be confident that it can only be accessed by defined stakeholders
    4. Conclusions At the start of this paper, we formulated four research questions
    about sensors and sensor networks in the context of crop production: How do they
    support crop production? What added-value do they bring to production process?
    How users benefit? Which are the risks and bottlenecks involved? The review showed
    that lot of potential is seen in sensors and sensor networks along the crop production
    chain ranging from soil preparation to the harvesting and from monitoring of growing
    conditions to automated control of machinery. Also some commercial sensor based
    products (e.g., near sensing systems) and services (e.g., plant protection services,
    frost alert services) were currently available. Presently, sensor technology was
    mostly adopted to support decision making and assist farmer in timing of production
    practises, such as irrigation or plant protection or in allocating chemicals or
    nutrients according to sensor observed needs (e.g., site-specific management).
    Other sensors collected information that can be used in the evaluation of production
    success (e.g., quality and amount of yield). The most advanced sensor systems
    were used for automated control or adjust of machines or vehicles. Benefits were
    then gained through better decisions and by developing production process. Overall
    benefits were obtained in terms of higher yields, improved quality of yields,
    decreased input costs and production risks or less work time or load. The sensor
    based applications may also help to reduce environmental effects or food safety
    risks by lowering use of nutrients, chemicals, energy and water. Quality of sensor
    data and how it is communicated to the end-users has a high importance. Errors
    in the data can trigger to wrong decisions leading to the inefficient resources
    use, and increased costs and environment risks. Therefore, in automated systems
    with low level of human intervention, this must be especially considered. There
    is a risk that users abandon new techniques because it does not respond to their
    demands on data or application quality. Operational sensor networks call for well-developed
    error diagnostics that alert the user on fault situations and maintenance actions
    needed. Alternatively, commercial measurement services may take care of the maintenance
    and users’ attention may not be needed. Another point we would like to raise is
    the integration of sensing data in applications and control systems used in the
    farms. It should be easy to integrate local measurement into the application but
    also the measurement or model result produced by these applications should be
    easy to integrate back to the farming information or control systems through open
    interfaces and standard data formats. Standards and interoperability are of the
    essence that sensor based application are utilised in developing and planning
    crop production in practise. This is an issue that has been widely acknowledged,
    and a lot of progress has been made in recent years. Thirdly, all sensors (both
    mechanical and electronic) need maintenance and recalibration in order to control
    the quality of measurements. Maintenance intensity varies a lot and often causes
    great part of measuring costs. The importance of maintenance was not raised in
    the reviewed applications, maybe because they were mostly research oriented and
    applied in short term testbeds. The review showed a wide spectrum of applications
    and sensor technologies that have potential to benefit crop production. Although
    some commercial and operational applications exist, majority of the reviewed applications
    are still running in the research domain. Further testing on usability, reliability
    and compatibility of applications in practical domain will finally show when or
    if the benefits gained from sensor technology overcome costs, maintenance efforts
    and risks related technology. References Stefanidis, A; Nittel, S. GeoSensor Networks;

  title: 'Geosensors to support crop production: Current applications and user requirements'
  verbatim_quote1: Sensor technology, which benefits from high temporal measuring
    resolution, real-time data transfer and high spatial resolution of sensor data
    that shows in-field variations, has the potential to provide added value for crop
    production.
  verbatim_quote2: The present paper explores how sensors and sensor networks have
    been utilised in the crop production process and what their added-value and the
    main bottlenecks are from the perspective of users.

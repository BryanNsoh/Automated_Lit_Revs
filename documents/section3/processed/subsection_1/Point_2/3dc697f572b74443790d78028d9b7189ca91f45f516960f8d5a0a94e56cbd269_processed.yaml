  analysis: This paper explores the microbial response of different bacterial and
    fungal groups to extreme desiccation and rewetting in soil samples from three
    California grassland sites. In response to summer desiccation, the bacterial and
    fungal community composition differed among sites, but all had a similar response
    to drying and rewetting. Although the community composition of the active bacterial
    community changed significantly as the summer dry-down progressed, it returned
    to pre-dry-down composition within several hours of rewetting. In contrast, the
    fungal community composition was not detectably different among sites and was
    largely unaffected by dry-down. In response to rewetting, transcript copies of
    bacterial rpoB genes increased consistently, reflecting rapid activity resumption.
    The authors propose that predicted changes in precipitation patterns may affect
    soil nutrient and carbon cycling by differentially impacting activity patterns
    of microbial communities.

    \ Australia\nThe microbial response to summer desiccation reflects adaptation\
    \ strategies, setting the stage for a\nlarge rainfall-induced soil CO2 pulse upon\
    \ rewetting, an important component of the ecosystem\ncarbon budget. In three\
    \ California annual grasslands, the present (DNA-based) and potentially active\n\
    (RNA-based) soil bacterial and fungal communities were tracked over a summer season\
    \ and in\nresponse to controlled rewetting of intact soil cores. Phylogenetic\
    \ marker genes for bacterial (16S)\nand fungal (28S) RNA and DNA were sequenced,\
    \ and the abundances of these genes and transcripts\nwere measured. Although bacterial\
    \ community composition differed among sites, all sites shared a\nsimilar response\
    \ pattern of the present and potentially active bacterial community to dry-down\
    \ and\nwet-up. In contrast, the fungal community was not detectably different\
    \ among sites, and was largely\nunaffected by dry-down, showing marked resistance\
    \ to dessication. The potentially active bacterial\ncommunity changed significantly\
    \ as summer dry-down progressed, then returned to pre-dry-down\ncomposition within\
    \ several hours of rewetting, displaying spectacular resilience. Upon rewetting,\n\
    transcript\ncopies\nof\nbacterial\nrpoB\ngenes\nincreased\nconsistently,\nreflecting\n\
    rapid\nactivity\nresumption. Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant\
    \ phyla present and potentially\nactive, and showed the largest changes in relative\
    \ abundance. The relative increase (Actinobacteria)\nand decrease (Acidobacteria)\
    \ with dry-down, and the reverse responses to rewetting reflected a\ndifferential\
    \ response, which was conserved at the phylum level and consistent across sites.\
    \ These\ncontrasting desiccation-related bacterial life-strategies suggest that\
    \ predicted changes in precipita-\ntion patterns may affect soil nutrient and\
    \ carbon cycling by differentially impacting activity patterns\nof microbial communities.\n\

    tion and drought patterns, resulting in more extreme\nconditions, especially for\
    \ Mediterranean ecosystems\n(IPCC, 2007), which are characterised by hot dry\n\
    summers and cool wet winters. Microbial miner-\nalization of carbon substrates\
    \ that are accumulated\nduring the summer period fuels large mineralization\n\
    pulses upon soil rewetting (Birch, 1958; Borken and\nMatzner, 2009; Inglima et\
    \ al., 2009). CO2 pulses\nresulting\nfrom\nthe\nrewetting\nof\nMediterranean\n\
    annual grasslands after the summer dry period\naccount for a large part of the\
    \ annual carbon they\nlose to the atmosphere (Xu et al., 2004; Jarvis et al.,\n\

    Both bacterial\nand\nfungal\nisolates\nhave\nknown strategies to survive desiccation\
    \ and rewet-\nting (Potts, 1994; Griffin, 1977), including: (i) the\naccumulation\
    \ of compatible solutes (see review\nby Schimel et al., 2007); (ii) exopolysaccharide\n\
    production, extensively studied in Pseudomonas\nsp. (Roberson and Firestone, 1992;\
    \ Chang et al.,\n2007) and recently in Acidobacteria (Ward et al.,\n2009); and\
    \ (iii) the production of dormant life forms\nsuch as spores. Field-based evidence\
    \ of different\nbacterial groups displaying contrasting desiccation-\nrelated\
    \ life-strategies nevertheless remain scarce.\nTolerance\nto\ndesiccation\nmay\n\
    also\nresult\nfrom\nmorphological life form: fungi are generally con-\nsidered\
    \ more resistant to desiccation than bacteria\n(Gordon et al., 2008; de Vries\
    \ et al., 2012), with\nhyphae that may cross air-filled soil pores to access\n\
    nutrients and water.\nBoth soil bacteria and fungi include heterotrophic\nmicroorganisms\
    \ that are capable of rapid activation\nupon wet-up, that is, of playing a role\
    \ in the\nmineralization burst that is responsible for the soil\nCO2 efflux pulse\
    \ following a rewetting event (Fierer\nand Schimel, 2003; Placella et al., 2012).\
    \ Although\nmicrobial\ncommunities\nhave\nsometimes\nbeen\nshown to shift seasonally\
    \ in water-limited systems\n(Waldrop and Firestone, 2006b; Clark et al., 2009;\n\
    Cruz-Martinez\net\nal.,\n2009),\nthe\nfunctional\nor\ntaxonomic groups that drive\
    \ the microbial response\nto dry-down and rewetting, their associated strategies\n\
    and to what extent these responses may be general-\nised still remain largely\
    \ unclear (Placella et al., 2012).\nMolecular techniques based on ribosomal RNA\n\
    (rRNA)\nallow\nthe\nphylogenetic\ncharacterisation\nof bacterial and fungal groups\
    \ that are present (as\nrRNA genes) and that have the capacity to actively\nsynthesise\
    \ proteins (rRNA). The abundance of rRNA\nhas commonly been used as an indicator\
    \ of activity\n(for example, Schippers et al., 2005; Jones and\nLennon, 2010;\
    \ see review by Blazewicz et al.,\n2013). The present study investigated changes\
    \ in\nthe present and potentially active soil bacterial and\nfungal communities,\
    \ in three Mediterranean annual\ngrasslands in California, over a 5-month summer\n\
    dry-down\nperiod\nand\nsubsequent\nrewetting.\nThe primary objective was to assess\
    \ the temporal\nresponses of the diverse components of the soil\nmicrobial community\
    \ to extreme desiccation and\nsubsequent rewetting across the three sites, in\
    \ order\nto better understand the life history bases of below-\nground response\
    \ to dry-down and wet-up. The three\nsites are similar ecosystems, albeit with\
    \ different\nsoil properties and climatic conditions, thus allow-\ning us to test\
    \ for site-specific microbial community\ndynamics in addition to more general\
    \ summer\ndesiccation and rewetting responses. For this pur-\npose, ribosomal\
    \ RNA transcripts and genes from\nbacteria and fungi were analysed by 454 Titanium\n\
    pyrosequencing, and the abundance of selected\nphylogenetic marker genes and transcripts\
    \ was\nmeasured using quantitative PCR. We expected to\nlearn how highly adapted\
    \ indigenous bacterial and\nfungal communities were to extreme desiccation\nand\
    \ wet-up, and whether the present and potentially\nactive communities would differ\
    \ among sites (due to\nedaphic\nand\nclimatic\ndifferences)\nand\nthereby\nrespond\
    \ differently to dry-down and rewetting.\nMaterials and methods\nField sites\n\
    Three California grasslands sites with contrasting\nrainfall patterns and soil\
    \ types (Supplementary\nTable S1) were chosen: (i) Hopland field station\n(University\
    \ of California Hopland Research and\nExtension Center, 3910’N, 12313’W), (ii)\
    \ Sierra field\nstation (University of California Sierra Foothill\nResearch and\
    \ Extension Center 39114’N, 121117’W)\nand\n(iii)\nSedgwick\nfield\nstation\n\
    (University\nof\nCalifornia Sedgwick Reserve 34142’N, 12012’W).\nSoil from the\
    \ Sedgwick site has lower organic matter\nand organic carbon content but higher\
    \ clay content\nthan the other two soils. The Hopland soil has a\nlower saturation\
    \ percentage and cation-exchange\ncapacity than the other sites.\nAn experimental\
    \ plot (5 \x02 5 m2) was established in\neach grassland, within a homogeneous\
    \ fenced area.\nIn each plot, 20 PVC cores (7.5 cm internal diameter,\n15 cm long)\
    \ were inserted in the soil, 15 cm deep,\nB1 m apart, between the 5th and the\
    \ 12th of April\n2010, depending on the site. Core installation may\nhave severed\
    \ some plant roots and potentially\naltered rhizodeposition; however, plant photosyn-\n\
    thetic activity does not exceed a few weeks after\nApril at these sites, and most\
    \ plants had set seed and\nwere senescing by this time. Five cores were\nrandomly\
    \ chosen and removed from each site, three\ntimes over the spring-summer dry-down\
    \ period:\n5–12 April, 15–18 June and 2–8 September 2010. At\neach sampling date,\
    \ each site was sampled within a\nday, and three sites were sampled within a week.\
    \ To\navoid edge effects, the PVC cores were internally\ncored (5 cm diameter,\
    \ 10 cm depth). The internal\ncore was sieved and subsampled to determine\ngravimetric\
    \ water content (by comparing fresh with\n105 1C dried soil weights), whereas\
    \ the remaining\nsieved soil was stored at \x03 80 1C, before nucleic acid\nextraction.\n\
    A composite of soil collected within each plot at\nthe initial sampling date was\
    \ analysed for soil\nchemical and physical properties (University of\nCalifornia,\
    \ Davis, Analytical Laboratory). A soil–\nwater retention curve was established\
    \ on the basis of\nthe soil–water potential measured using a constant\npreset\
    \ atmospheric pressure potential (four points\nbetween\n\x03 0.03 and\n\x03 1\
    \ MPa) and an isopiestic\nmethod (four points between \x03 4.6 and \x03 88 MPa,\n\
    using\nsaturated\nsolutions\nof\ncopper\nsulphate,\nsucrose, sodium chloride and\
    \ magnesium nitrate,\nTokunaga et al., 2003).\nMicrobial response to desiccation\
    \ and rewetting\nRL Barnard et al\n2230\nThe ISME Journal\nWet-up\nAt the last\
    \ sampling date (2–8 September 2010), five\nadditional cores were taken and subjected,\
    \ under\ncontrolled conditions, to a simulated first rainfall\nevent after summer\
    \ desiccation. The bottom of the\ncores was sealed, and a 1-L PVC chamber was\
    \ fitted\nairtight\non\ntop of\nthe\ncore.\nImmediately\nafter\ninstalling the\
    \ chamber, distilled water was dis-\npensed through a septum onto the soil surface\
    \ over\na 2-min period, while a needle through another\nseptum ensured no pressure\
    \ build-up. The amount\nof water delivered to each core approximated the\nmoisture\
    \ lost during dry-down in the soils of each\nsite, based on the average weight\
    \ loss of cores during\ndry-down and amounted to a ca. 25 mm rain event.\nThe\
    \ water added was left to penetrate the soils for\n2 hours, thus amounting to\
    \ 12.5 mm h \x03 1, which is\nnear the upper limit of precipitation amounts at\
    \ the\nsites. Two hours after rewetting, the cores were\ninternally cored, and\
    \ soil samples processed as\nabove.\nSoil nucleic acid extraction and purification\n\
    Both DNA and RNA were extracted from the soil\nsamples, using the protocol adapted\
    \ from Griffiths\net al., (2000) and Brodie et al., (2002). All solutions\nand\
    \ glassware were rendered RNase-free by diethyl\npyrocarbonate (DEPC) treatment.\
    \ In brief, for each\nsoil sample, three 0.4 g dry-weight subsamples were\nextracted\
    \ separately. Each aliquot was transferred to\na 2-ml Lysing Matrix E tube (MP\
    \ Biomedicals, Solon,\nOH, USA) and extracted twice as follows. Five\nhundred\
    \ microlitre extraction buffer (5% CTAB,\n0.5 M NaCl, 240 mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0) and\
    \ 500 ml\n25:24:1\nphenol:chloroform:isoamyl\nalcohol\nwere\nadded before shaking\
    \ (FastPrep24, MP Biomedicals;\n30 s, 5.5 m s \x03 1). After spinning down the\
    \ debris\n(16 100 g,\n5 min,\n4 1C),\nthe\nnucleic\nacids\nwere\npurified using\
    \ pre-spun 2 ml Phase Lock Gel tubes\n(5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD) with an equal\
    \ volume\nof 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, mixed and\ncentrifuged (16 100 g,\
    \ 2 min, 4 1C). The aqueous\nphases from both extractions were pooled, mixed\n\
    with 1 ml 40% polyethylene glycol 6000 dissolved\nin 1.6 M NaCl and 3 ml linear\
    \ acrylamide (5 mg ml \x03 1;\nAmbion, Grand Island, NY, USA), and incubated for\n\
    1 h at the room temperature. After centrifugation\n(16 100 g, 20 min, room temperature),\
    \ the pellet was\nrinsed with 1 ml ice-cold 70% ethanol, air-dried,\nresuspended\
    \ in 20 ml RNase-free water and stored at\n\x03 80 1C. For each sample, the three\
    \ subsample\nextracts were pooled during purification (AllPrep\nDNA/RNA Mini Kit,\
    \ Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA)\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\
    Abundance of genes and transcripts\nThe extracted DNA and RNA were quantified\
    \ using\nQuant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA and RiboGreen RNA\nreagents, respectively (Invitrogen,\
    \ Grand Island,\nNY, USA) with a CFX96 thermocycler (Bio-Rad\nLaboratories, Inc.,\
    \ Hercules, CA, USA). cDNA was\ngenerated from 50 ng of the extracted RNA from\
    \ each\nsubsample using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcrip-\ntion Kit (Qiagen) and\
    \ then pooled.\nThe abundance of genes and transcripts was\nassessed by quantitative\
    \ polymerase chain reaction\n(qPCR). The genes encoding bacterial 16S, archaeal\n\
    16S and fungal 28S ribosomal components were\nselected as phylogenetic markers.\
    \ The bacterial rpoB\ngene was also selected, as this single-copy gene\nencodes\
    \ a sub-unit of the bacterial RNA polymerase\nand thus provides an estimation\
    \ of transcriptional\nactivity.\nThe\nprimers\nused\nwere:\nEUB338\nand\nEUB518\
    \ for bacterial 16S (Fierer et al., 2005); NL1f\nand LS2r for fungal 28S (Bates\
    \ and Garcia-Pichel,\n2009); A364aF and A934b for archaeal 16S (Kemnitz\net al.,\
    \ 2005); and rpoB-f-4 and rpoB-r-2 for bacterial\nrpoB gene (Silkie and Nelson,\
    \ 2009).\nDNA and cDNA quantification was performed\nusing a CFX96 thermocycler\
    \ (Bio-Rad) in a total\nvolume of 12 ml including 2 to 4 ng DNA or 2.5 ng\ncDNA,\
    \ 10 ml SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad)\nand 300 mM of each primer. All qPCR\
    \ assays were run\nfor 30 s at 95 1C, and then 40 cycles, with plate-\nreading,\
    \ of 95 1C for 5 s and 60 1C for 15 s, with a\nfinal melt-curve step from 75 1C\
    \ to 95 1C. Standard\ncurves\nwere\nobtained\nusing\nserial\ndilutions\nof\nplasmids\n\
    containing\nthe\ncloned\ngenes\nand\nthe\nefficiencies\nranged\nbetween\n91.9–108.7%\n\
    (R2 minimum 0.985).\nPyrosequencing of bacterial and fungal communities\nDNA and\
    \ cDNA samples from three randomly\nchosen replicate cores from each site and\
    \ sampling\ndate were sequenced by 8 bp tag-encoded FLX\namplicon\npyrosequencing,\n\
    except\nfor\nthe\nDNA\nextracts from the second dry-down sampling date\n(due to\
    \ lack of funds). In total, 36 cDNA samples and\n27\nDNA\nsamples\nwere\nsequenced\n\
    (Research\nand Testing Laboratory, Lubbock, TX, USA; Roche\n454 FLX Titanium).\
    \ Initial generation of the sequen-\ncing libraries utilised a one-step PCR with\
    \ a total of\n30 cycles, a mixture of Hot Start and HotStar High-\nFidelity Taq\
    \ polymerases. The primers used were\n939F (50-TTGACGGGGGCCCGCAC-30) and 1492R\n\
    (50-TACCTTGTTACGACTT-30) to sequence the V6\nregion\nof\nthe\nbacterial\n16S,\n\

    \ to sequence the D1 domain\nof the fungal 28S. The sequence data were submitted\n\
    to\nthe\nNCBI\nSequence\nRead\nArchive\ndatabase\n(accession No. SRP016037). The\
    \ pyrotag analysis\nwas run using PyroTagger (Kunin and Hugenholtz,\n2010) as\
    \ follows. Sequences were denoised, quality\nfiltered by removing reads with X3%\
    \ low-quality\nbases over a given length, length filtered at 200\nnucleotides,\n\
    clustered\n(uclust\nalgorithm,\nEdgar,\n2010) using the most abundant unique sequence\

    \ on the greengenes website (DeSantis et al.,\n2006).\nThe phylogenetic structure\

    \ all sites and sampling\ntimes was used.\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical analyses\
    \ were performed in R 2.15.0\n(R Development Core Team, 2012). DNA and RNA\ndata\

    \ between site and\neither dry-down or wet-up. The effect of dry-down\nwas determined\
    \ over three time points (5–12 April,\n15–18 June and 2–8 September 2010). The\

    function\nof\nvegan\npackage,\nAnderson, 2001), nested by site. The explanatory\n\
    variables were site and dry-down or wet-up, and\ntheir interaction.\nRelative\n\
    abundances\nof\nbacterial\nand\nfungal\ngroups were analysed by aggregating all\
    \ taxa at the\nphylum and class levels. The analysis targeted the\nmost abundant\
    \ phyla and classes, by using the\nlowest relative abundance threshold that ensured\n\
    that all taxa in the analysis were present in all the\nsamples. For bacteria,\
    \ this threshold corresponded\nto the phyla and classes accounting for more than\n\
    1% of the total number of OTUs sequenced in at\nleast one sample at one sampling\
    \ time and site. For\nfungal phyla and classes, the threshold was 0.5%\nand 1%,\
    \ respectively. The relative abundance of\nthe\nmost\nabundant\nbacterial\nand\n\
    fungal\ntaxa\nwas analysed by analysis of variance, after log-\ntransformation\
    \ of the data. The explanatory vari-\nables were site, taxonomic identity (phylum\
    \ or\nclass), either dry-down or wet-up, and their inter-\nactions. The statistical\

    \ pattern, with most rain during\nthe winter months and a 3- to 5-month dry-summer\n\
    period. However, they generally experience different\nyearly precipitation amounts,\
    \ which during the\n2009-2010 growth season ranged from 346 mm in\nSedgwick to\
    \ 932 mm in Hopland (Figure 1a). Despite\nseveral rain events between our first\
    \ two sampling\ndates, soil water content showed a pronounced dry-\ndown pattern\
    \ over the sampling period, from above\n20% in April to an average 4.2% in September\
    \ 2010\n(Figure 1b). By September, soil water potential had\ndropped to extremely\

    \ 7e–h) over all sites, with no\nsignificant difference in the response among\
    \ sites.\nDiscussion\nBacterial and fungal community-level response\nThe composition\
    \ of both the DNA-based (present)\nand rRNA-based (potentially active) bacterial\
    \ com-\nmunities at the three Californian grassland sites\nwere site-specific.\
    \ However, their compositional\nresponse to dry-down and wet-up did not differ\n\
    among sites. The most prominent features of these\nresponses to changes in water\
    \ availability were (i)\nthe relatively small magnitude of change of most\npresent\
    \ bacterial groups and (ii) the large relative\nresponse of several groups, in\
    \ particular Actinobacteria\n(increased in relative abundance with desiccation,\n\
    decreased\nwith\nrewetting)\nand\nAcidobacteria\n(decreased in relative abundance\
    \ with desiccation,\nincreased with rewetting), the two most abundant\nphyla of\
    \ both the present and potentially active\ncommunities. Thus, in these grassland\
    \ systems, soil\nbacterial communities appear to follow parallel\nresponses to\
    \ changes in water availability, despite\ndifferences in community composition,\
    \ soil type\nand local climate. In contrast to the bacterial\ncommunity, neither\
    \ the present nor the potentially\nactive fungal communities in the field were\
    \ detec-\ntably different among sites. In addition, these fungal\ncommunities\
    \ remained unaffected by dry-down or\nwet-up, displaying a marked resistance to\
    \ changes\nin water availability. The contrasted bacterial and\nfungal responses\
    \ support the ecological distinction\nof fungi and bacteria (de Boer et al., 2005),\
    \ which\nhere\nappear\nto\noccupy\ndifferent\nwater-related\nniches. The dry-down\
    \ response of both the present\nand\nthe\npotentially\nactive\nfungal\ncommunities\n\
    did not differ among sites, which is similar to our\nfindings for bacteria. Our\
    \ study is consistent with\nseasonal changes in the microbial community in\narid\
    \ or semi-arid systems, shown using\n13C-PLFA\ntargeting the active microbial\
    \ community (Waldrop\nand Firestone, 2006b), or a DNA-based approach\ntargeting\
    \ the present community (Clark et al., 2009;\nCruz-Martinez et al., 2009).\nThe\
    \ rRNA-based soil bacterial community struc-\nture in all three sites returned\
    \ to pre-dry-down\nstructure within 2 h of rewetting, highlighting the\nresilience\
    \ of the potentially active soil bacterial\ncommunities in California semiarid\
    \ grasslands. The\nphylogenetic structure of the RNA-based commu-\nnity reflected\
    \ this resilience, as the desiccation-\nrelated increase in clustering was released\
    \ upon\nwet-up,\nreturning\nto\npre-desiccation\nlevels.\nIn\ncontrast, both the\
    \ DNA-based bacterial community\nstructure and NRI remained unaffected by changes\n\
    in water availability. The dry-downs in our study\nconstituted normal summer dry-downs\
    \ for these\nsites, and thus we did not expect large changes in\nthe taxonomic\
    \ structure of the present communities\nover summer. On the other hand, the RNA-based\n\
    community would be expected to be more variable,\nas RNA is known to be much more\
    \ responsive to\nchanging environmental conditions. Our results\nFigure 6\nDynamics\

    Microbial response to desiccation and rewetting\nRL Barnard et al\n2236\nThe ISME\
    \ Journal\npoint towards dynamic changes in the potential\nactivity of several\
    \ major bacterial taxa (in particular\nbelonging to the Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria\n\
    phyla), depending on soil moisture status. Further,\nthe spectacular increase\
    \ in rpoB transcript abun-\ndance, which was consistent across sites, reflects\
    \ the\nrapid resumption of transcriptional activity in soil\nbacteria upon rewetting.\n\
    The gene abundances of bacterial 16S, fungal 28S\nand\narchaeal\n16S\nincreased\n\
    during\ndry-down;\nhowever, their respective transcript abundances\ndid not change.\
    \ This suggests an increased number\nof microbial cells with less potential for\
    \ activity per\ncell. The increase in number of microbial cells is\nconsistent\
    \ with the reported increase in microbial\nbiomass in a California grassland over\
    \ the dry\nsummer (Parker and Schimel, 2011). This is also\nconsistent with previous\
    \ work showing bacterial\ncell\ndivision\nand\ndown-sizing\nin\nresponse\nto\n\
    desiccation\nas\nwell\nas\nstarvation\n(Potts,\n1994;\nAlvarez et al., 2004).\n\
    As a whole, the bacterial community appears to\ntolerate the rapid upshock in\
    \ water potential (influx\nof water), which is known to cause lysis (plasmop-\n\
    tysis) in many bacterial cells that have adjusted to\nlow water potential conditions\
    \ (Kieft et al., 1987;\nHalverson et al., 2000). On the basis of the rapid\n(within\
    \ 2 h) increase in rRNA in bacteria, archaea\nand fungi, the members of these\
    \ soil communities\nappear to be poised for immediate response to\nrewetting (Placella\
    \ et al., 2012); this is consistent\nwith the large pulses of CO2 that result\
    \ from wetting\nof dry soil (Borken and Matzner, 2009; Inglima\net al., 2009).\

    \ analyses has the potential to further unveil\nthe microbial mechanisms that\
    \ drive the CO2 pulse\nupon rewetting dry soils.\nWater-related bacterial and\
    \ fungal life-strategies\nChanges in relative abundance of the most numer-\nous\
    \ bacterial taxa (by pyrosequencing) were mainly\ndue to differing responses of\
    \ different taxa rather\nthan to site-driven responses, whether considering\n\
    the present or the potentially active community.\nHere, we define a life-strategy\
    \ as a set of traits driving\nthe response to environmental and physiological\n\
    conditions, and geared towards survival, growth\nand reproduction. The analysis\
    \ at the phylum and\nclass levels point towards different life-strategies\nwithin\
    \ the potentially active bacterial community.\nIn\ncontrast,\nthe\nfungal\ncommunity\n\
    generally\nremained\nunaffected\nby\ndesiccation.\nOur\ndirect\ncharacterisation\
    \ of the stronger desiccation resistance\nof the potential activity of fungi compared\
    \ with\nbacteria is consistent with the results from recent\nstudies that used\
    \ a PFLA approach to document the\nstability of fungal-based compared with bacterial-\n\
    based food webs in grasslands (Gordon et al., 2008;\nde Vries et al., et al.,\
    \ 2012).\nIn the bacterial community, changes in the ratio of\nrRNA transcript\
    \ to ribosomal rRNA gene abundance\nof the most abundant phyla were driven by\
    \ changes\nin the former in our experiment, indicating that\nchanges\nin\nrRNA\n\
    transcript\nabundance\nmainly\nreflected changes in the level of cellular transcrip-\n\
    tional machinery, that is, ribosome synthesis in the\ncell. The response of the\
    \ relative rRNA abundance\nof the main bacterial phyla to changes in water\navailability\
    \ followed three distinct patterns in our\nexperiment. Two response patterns were\
    \ charac-\nterised by high responsiveness to changes in soil\nmoisture but with\
    \ contrasted strategies. First, the\nAcidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia phyla displayed\n\
    a water-related opportunistic behaviour: these phyla\nshowed a rapid decline in\
    \ ribosomal synthesis as\ndry-down progressed, mirrored by a fast response\nof\
    \ ribosome synthesis to rewetting. Second, the\nActinobacteria\nphylum\nshowed\n\
    the\nopposite\nresponse pattern, their synthesis of ribosomes being\nstimulated\
    \ by desiccation and reduced after rewet-\nting. By accumulating ribosomes throughout\
    \ the\ndry-down period, Actinobacteria may be able to gain\na head start as soon\
    \ as conditions become more\nfavourable for nutrient acquisition. The observed\n\
    decline in relative ribosome levels upon rewetting\nmay\npossibly\nbe\nexplained\n\
    by\na\ncompetitive\ndisadvantage during the first hours of rewetting.\nNumerous\
    \ members of the Gram-positive, high-\nG þ C content Actinobacteria phylum are\
    \ drought\nresistant and have been shown to be able to grow\nunder\nchallenging\n\
    dry\nconditions\n(Goodfellow\nand Williams, 1983; Zvyagintsev et al., 2007).\n\
    Nevertheless, the Rubrobacteridae class, which is\nabundant at our sites as well\
    \ as in other water-\nlimited soils, remains poorly characterised (Holmes\net\
    \ al., 2000; Placella et al., 2012). In contrast with the\nActinobacteria\nphylum,\n\
    the\nAcidobacteria\nand\nVerrucomicrobia phyla do not appear to invest\nin ribosome\
    \ accumulation during desiccation, but\nto rely on extremely rapid ribosomal synthesis\n\
    upon rewetting. The third response pattern was\ncharacterised by a resistant response\
    \ pattern, with\ngenerally stable ribosome content throughout both\ndry-down and\
    \ wet-up, in the phyla Proteobacteria,\nChloroflexi,\nFirmicutes,\nGemmatimonadetes\n\
    and\nPlanctomycetes.\nThe classification of bacterial groups with respect\nto\
    \ nutrition and growth is a century-long effort\n(Winogradsky,\n1924,\nsee\nterminology\n\
    overview\nby Langer et al., 2004). Fierer et al., (2007) have\nproposed an ecological\
    \ classification on the basis of\na few deep-rooted bacterial phyla along a copio-\n\
    trophic (analogue to r-strategist: fast growing under\nhigh nutrient availability,\
    \ highly variable popula-\ntion size) to oligotrophic range (analogue to K-strate-\n\
    gist: slow-growing, more stable population size).\nSeveral studies have documented\
    \ the oligotrophic\nlife-strategy of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia,\ncontrasting\
    \ with the copiotrophic Actinobacteria,\nalong soil carbon and nitrogen availability\
    \ gradients\n(Fierer et al., 2007; Nemergut et al., 2010; Fierer\net al., 2012;\
    \ Ramirez et al., 2012). In contrast, we\nfind that when considering the water\
    \ availability\nand time dimensions, a different ecological classifi-\ncation\n\
    emerges,\nwhere\n(i)\nAcidobacteria\nand\nVerrucomicrobia follow a fast-response\
    \ life-strategy,\n(ii) Actinobacteria displays a preparedness strategy\nand\n\

    \ follow a\nmore stable and resistant life-strategy. Our results\nshow that niche\
    \ dimension matters for bacteria:\nconsidering the soil water availability and\
    \ time\ndimensions rather than the nutrient availability\ndimension involves a\
    \ different set of traits and results\nin a different ecological life-strategy\
    \ classification\n(for example, Lennon et al., 2012). Our results\nsupport the\
    \ ecological grouping of bacterial phyla\nalong the lines of the life-history\
    \ concepts initially\ndeveloped for plants and animals (MacArthur and\nWilson,\
    \ 1967), but stress the need to include the\nlife-strategies of bacterial phyla\
    \ within a framework\nof multi-dimensional niche.\nThe clear responses that we\
    \ determined were\napparent at phylum and class levels, showing that\npatterns\
    \ of bacterial response to changes in water\navailability were conserved at high\
    \ phylogenetic\ngroupings, supporting the recent hypothesis of\necological coherence\
    \ among deeply rooted bacterial\ngroups (Philippot et al., 2010; Lennon et al.,\
    \ 2012;\nPlacella et al., 2012). Such a coherence appears all\nthe more surprising\
    \ in that the most responsive\nbacterial phyla, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria,\n\
    form broad, diverse groups that likely cover a\nwide metabolic range (Quaiser\
    \ et al., 2003; Gao\nMicrobial response to desiccation and rewetting\nRL Barnard\
    \ et al\n2238\nThe ISME Journal\nand Gupta, 2012). Our findings suggest that deep\n\
    taxonomic nodes may constitute meaningful ecolo-\ngical units for the response\
    \ to drying and rewetting.\nBetter understanding the evolutionary implications\n\
    of the traits that underlie this coherence would be a\nvaluable next step.\nConclusion\n\
    Our study shows that adaptation of soil bacteria to\nextreme soil desiccation\
    \ and rapid rewetting in\nMediterranean\ngrasslands\nis\nexpressed\nthrough\n\
    different bacterial life-strategies, conferring a spec-\ntacular resilience to\
    \ the potentially active bacterial\ncommunities. The similar response trajectories\
    \ of\nthese communities across sites, despite site-specific\ncommunity composition\
    \ and structure, suggest that\nthese life-strategies may be indicative of general\n\
    patterns. The desiccation response of fungi seemed\nto reflect a high degree of\
    \ resistance to changes\nin water availability. Future trait-based approaches\n\
    should be useful to provide insights into the\nresponse of ecosystem functions\
    \ in relation to\nshifts in microbial groups. Changes in precipitation\nregimes\
    \ that are predicted to have an impact on\nMediterranean systems may affect the\
    \ life-history\nenvelope of soil microorganisms, which could in\nturn have an\
    \ impact on the soil microbial commu-\nnity and its functions, with potential\
    \ effects on\ncarbon budgets and nutrient cycling on a large\nscale.\nAcknowledgements\n\

  analysis: The paper probes the suitability of various remote sensing methods for
    distinguishing between active crop and fallow lands in the interest of improving
    irrigation management. It finds that a supervised spectral angle mapper (SAM)
    method for classifying active versus fallow lands from ETM+ imagery achieves an
    overall accuracy of 93.63%. The paper also concludes that using the SAM method
    on higher resolution IKONOS imagery provides no clear advantage over using ETM+
    imagery, but the higher spatial resolution of IKONOS imagery allows for a valuable
    result of identifying poor growing conditions within fields. The coarser resolution
    of ETM+ imagery made these conditions indistinguishable from fallow lands. The
    paper also finds that a simpler NDVI method produces accuracy comparable to the
    SAM method when combined with a pre-processing step to exclude non-agricultural
    lands from the analysis.

    PDF Abstract The objective of the study was to examine suitable remote sensing
    methods and data for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in
    order to improve irrigation management. We compared classification results from
    a supervised classification method and a method using normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) with additional pre‐classification processing. IKONOS and Landsat
    Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were tested to see if high spatial
    resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages in distinguishing
    between active and fallow lands. The classification achieved an overall accuracy
    of 93.63%. The results showed that the supervised classification did not have
    a clear advantage over the simple method using NDVI at the level of distinguishing
    between active crops and fallow lands. The result suggests that using ETM+ instead
    of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate because of the high
    cost of IKONOS imageries and image heterogeneity of agricultural fields. It was
    shown that pre‐processing with a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural objects
    blended with agricultural fields is critical. 1. Introduction Knowing the acreage
    of active crops in a particular irrigation rotation is one of the most important
    factors for water planning and management, especially for semi‐arid and arid environments
    where water is limited. Efficiency of managing irrigation water is an important
    issue in arid and semi‐arid areas, such as along the Rio Grande Valley area in
    the south‐west USA where there is a major agriculture corridor for the region.
    The water requirement for an agricultural irrigation rotation usually depends
    on the area of active crops. Traditionally, water planning for agricultural water
    uses is conducted by referring to information on the acreage of irrigated agriculture
    and water supplied in the previous year. Previous water use information is usually
    incomplete since it consists of volunteer‐based reporting from farmers at the
    end of the year. Also, water demand for agricultural uses can vary significantly
    from year to year due to the changes of the acreage of active crops. Therefore,
    mapping and measuring active crops and fallow lands from satellite imagery would
    be appropriate for agricultural water‐use planning. Using satellite remote sensing
    technology for mapping irrigated areas was attempted several decades ago (Heller
    and Johnson 1979, Hoffman 1979, Tinney et al. 1979, Thiruvengadachari 1981). In
    the present decade, there have been new research efforts incorporating the rapid
    advancement of technology to improve the capability of monitoring agricultural
    and hydrological conditions of the land surface (Ambast et al. 2002). For example,
    Thome et al. ( 1988) used Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data and estimated
    the total irrigated area in the Mendoza province of Argentina. Azzali and Menenti
    ( 1996) used temporal data to distinguish the irrigated and non‐irrigated crops.
    Several studies (Vidal and Baqri 1995, Herrero and Casterad 1999) reported the
    results of using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to detect irrigated areas or
    to assess net water requirements in crop fields using supervised classification.
    A common deficiency of the previous methods of assessing acreages of croplands
    using remote sensing data is the complexity that is impractical for management
    purpose. Their classification methods of using regression or supervised training
    depend on absolute image values so the calibrated coefficients are not transferable
    to a variety of spatial and temporal conditions. Based on the literature, we question
    if these complex methods are significant in terms of achieving the required accuracy
    of classifying between active and fallow lands. One possible solution for simplifying
    the classification process might be the use of a simple classification method
    jointly with a pre‐processing scheme. In this study, we examined two land‐use
    classification methods with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery
    for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands. One is a complex
    supervised classification method, namely the spectral angle mapper (SAM), which
    is based on similarity of spectral characteristics of classes to training site
    (class). The other one is a simple classification method using the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) incorporating a pre‐classification processing
    procedure. By comparing to the complex SAM method, this study can determine if
    the NDVI‐based classification with a pre‐processing procedure would be a suitable
    method for irrigation planning. Suitable results for this application would be
    classification accuracy, less complexity in processing, and cost‐effectiveness
    for required data. In the pre‐classification processing, we explore the usefulness
    of involving ancillary data. The ancillary data include ortho‐planimetric layers
    and land resources, such as road edge, hydro line, hydro area, parcel base‐maps,
    and irrigation boundary. The ancillary data were used to create a mask for delineating
    agricultural fields by excluding non‐agricultural objects. Additionally, the IKONOS
    and Landsat ETM+ images were tested with the SAM classification method to see
    if high spatial resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages
    in distinguishing between active and fallow lands. Using ETM+ instead of IKONOS
    high spatial resolution imageries can avoid high cost of purchasing imageries.
    Besides the higher cost, the high resolution imagery might not be appropriate
    to use for land‐use with greater heterogeneity. Accuracy of classification with
    different methods and imageries were assessed using a confusion matrix based on
    ground data. The study results would be useful in identifying an accuracy‐reliable
    and cost‐effective method of extracting acreages of active crop fields and fallow
    lands for irrigation management and planning. 2. Study site and data The study
    site is located in El Paso County, Texas, part of the semi‐arid area of the south‐western
    USA (figure 1). Agricultural land uses dominate the site, including the Upper
    Valley and Lower Valley along the Rio Grande River valley. The total irrigated
    agriculture area is about 47 000 acres. Primary field crop commodities consist
    of cotton, pecan, corn, wheat, alfalfa, and commercial vegetables. Figure 1 Index
    map of the study area(El Paso, Texas). The IKONOS images covered two agricultural
    areas: Upper Valley and Lower Valley. Display full size Two types of imagery data,
    Landsat ETM+ and IKONOS, were used in the study. Simple dark subtraction method
    was used for radiometric correction. Five ETM+ images (path 33/row 38) acquired
    at different times (between 1999 and 2001) were sub‐setted to cover the study
    area (figure 1). Landsat ETM+ has a resolution of 30 m with six multi‐spectral
    bands, one thermal band of 60‐m resolution, and one panchromatic band of 15‐m
    resolution. The 386 scenes of IKONOS imagery were acquired by El Paso Water Utilities
    through a contract awarded to a Californian company. The acquisitions were carried
    out between August 2000 and February 2001 to satisfy the requirement of cloud
    free or less than 5% of cloud cover. The images in the Lower Valley portion (south,
    251 scenes) acquired from August to October 2000, and in the Upper Valley portion
    (north, 135 scenes) acquired from August 2000 to February 2001. Each scene is
    in 1‐m spatial resolution (4‐m multi‐spectral bands fused with 1‐m panchromatic
    band) with four bands: blue (band 1), green (band 2), red (band 3) and near‐infrared
    (band 4). Each image (tile) size is 1500×1500 pixels (i.e. 2.25 km2) All IKONOS
    and ETM+ images were geo‐referenced against the El Paso street centreline or El
    Paso Water Utility''s (EPWU) digital orthorectified airphotos, which are in 1‐foot
    spatial resolution and acquired in 1997. Both the street centreline and the orthorphotos
    are in Texas central state plane coordinates with North American Datum of 1983
    (NAD83). 3. Ground investigation (ground data) and analysis In order to understand
    the signatures of crops and fallow lands in the images, an area of 2295.7 acres
    was selected for ground investigation (ground data). The area is covered with
    four scenes of IKONOS images as displayed in figure 2. Three ground investigations
    were conducted on 25 July, 18 September, and 6 November 2001, respectively. The
    ground investigation served for both training and accuracy assessment. The first
    field investigation in 25 July (figure 2( b)) reflected all agricultural lands
    in the crop‐growing season and no fallow land in the ground data area. The area
    of crops was about 1854 acres out of the total area of 2295.7 acres (table 1).
    The remaining areas are residential, school and irrigation ditches. Cotton was
    the dominant crop (∼60%), with corn the second‐most dominant crop (∼27%). Besides
    crop lands, fallow lands (the harvested cornfields) were found in the second field
    investigation carried out on 18 September. This is similar to the situation in
    the previous year (2000) mapped by IKONOS images, as displayed in figure 2( c).
    This portion of IKONOS images was acquired mostly in September 2000, although
    the image acquisitions spanned from August to October 2000. The interpreted results
    of figure 2( c), combined with information observed from the second field investigation
    as well as the information from figure 2( a) and (b) are shown in figure 2( d).
    The acreage of each crop is also included in table 1. The total acreage of the
    fallow lands in this time of 2000 (mostly September) was 484.164 acres, which
    is similar to the total acreage of cornfields (492.191) in 2001. Also included
    from the IKONOS images of 2000 is the 1042.319 acres covered by ‘other crops’
    (table 1). The type of ‘other crops’ in 2000 is cotton, since cotton is usually
    harvested later than corn. In the third ground investigation of early November,
    only cotton (ready to be harvested) and alfalfa remained, while most of the harvested
    cornfields were growing sorgum, which will be ploughed for soil fertilizer in
    December. Figure 2 Images and related ground investigation(ground data) results.

    three field investigations provided the baseline information for various crops
    and experiences for selecting the training sites and for image interpretations.
    4. Pre‐processing and classifications 4.1 Excluding non‐agricultural fields A
    pre‐classification process was conducted to improve classification accuracy. The
    pre‐processing involves the creation of a mask for excluding non‐agricultural
    areas before the classification. figure 3 is a part of the Lower Valley image
    mosaicked from 183 IKONOS images. It visually shows that non‐agricultural fields
    (residential, commercial, school, road system) are blended with agricultural fields
    (green and white polygons). Furthermore, the far right portion (east) of the image
    is the dessert area, while the far left portion (west) of the image is the agriculture
    area in Mexican side (Rio Grande River is the border of the USA and Mexico). Due
    to the spectral similarities of objects in multi‐spectral imagery, a simple threshold‐based
    NDVI classification method as well as supervised‐based classification methods
    without pre‐classification processing are not capable of distinguishing the backyard
    grasses and trees in the residential area from crops. Similarly, spectral resemblance
    occurs to parking lots, roads, buildings, even desert area and fallow lands. Therefore,
    it was hypothesized that creating a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural fields
    would improve the classification accuracy. Figure 3 Portion of the mosaicked IKONOS
    image(tile rows 42–55) in the Lower Valley. Green and white polygons within the
    El Paso irrigation area overlaid on the image are the classified agricultural
    fields. They are active crops and fallow lands, respectively. Display full size
    Ancillary data in GIS format, such as road edge, hydro line, hydro area, parcel
    map, and irrigation boundary, were used for the creation of the mask. Road edge
    covers all of the paved roads (not including the small roads among agriculture
    fields). Hydro line refers to the small irrigation ditches and hydro area refers
    to the larger irrigation ditches. Both these two features overlap with most of
    unpaved roads, although they are much narrower than unpaved roads. Therefore,
    buffer zones of 25 feet on both sides of the hydro line and hydro area were created
    to mask these unpaved roads. Parcel maps were used to mask out residential, business,
    and school areas such as grassy lawns, sports fields, parking lots, and buildings.
    The irrigation boundary is used to exclude the areas outside the El Paso irrigation
    area such as the dessert area to the east and the Mexican side to the west. Then
    these five types of GIS layers were merged into one shapefile for exclusion from
    classification. With this shapefile, a mask shapefile that only covers the agriculture
    fields can then be created. In order to incorporate the mask into classification
    in ENVI software, a binary image of the mask was first produced from the mask
    shapefile. 4.2 Supervised classification There are many supervised classification
    methods such as parallelepiped, maximum likelihood, Mahalanobis distance, neural
    network, and spectral angle mapper. For an accurate classification in our preliminary
    test, we chose the SAM supervised classification in this study. Following usual
    procedures, we also conducted post‐classification with the popular methods, such
    as combining classes, sieve classes, and clump classes. For simplicity, we only
    detail the SAM method and the selection of training sites, while all methods and
    procedures used are summarized in table 2. Table 2. Summary of SAM‐based classification
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table 4.2.1 N‐dimensional visualizer and spectral
    endmembers selection Due to the heterogeneity of the land uses in the study site,
    training areas (polygons) were carefully handpicked as polygons in GIS throughout
    the entire irrigation area (not limited in the field data area). Since the same
    crop type (such as corn) may vary in spectral characteristics from field to field
    depending on growing status, water stress, pest infestation, and soil type, we
    usually picked many sites of each variation and then grouped all of them into
    one crop (corn, for example). Similarly, we also grouped many sites of bare soils,
    harvested lands, or ploughed fields throughout the entire irrigation area as fallow
    lands. The field investigations (§3) significantly helped the selection of training
    sites for July 2001. For other old images—four scenes of ETM+ images and all IKONOS
    images—the selection of training sites completely depended on expert''s knowledge
    due to the project not beginning until June 2001. The training polygons selected
    in GIS were converted as regions of interest (ROIs) in ENVI (image processing
    software). These ROIs were used in the N‐dimensional visualizer of ENVI to identify
    the purest pixels (i.e. most extreme spectral responses), or spectral endmembers.
    4.2.2 SAM classifier The SAM classifier is a physically‐based spectral classification
    method that uses n‐dimensional angles to match pixels to reference spectra. The
    algorithm determines the similarity between two spectra by calculating the angle
    between the spectra, treating them as vectors in a space with dimensionality equal
    to the number of bands. This technique, when used on calibrated reflectance data,
    is relatively insensitive to illumination and albedo effects. The SAM classification
    was conducted for both ETM+ and IKONOS images to classify the active crops and
    fallow lands of the El Paso County. An endmember spectrum used by SAM in this
    study was first extracted directly from the ROIs by averaging spectra derived
    from the previous section. SAM compares the angle between the endmember spectrum
    vector (ROI) and each pixel vector of the image in n‐dimensional space. Smaller
    angles (in radians) represent closer matches to the reference spectrum. Pixels
    with a spectral angle larger than a user‐specified maximum angle threshold (in
    radians) are not classified (ENVI User''s Guide, Research System, Inc. 2000, Kruse
    et al. 1993). Selecting the maximum angle threshold value is an important factor
    for successfully using SAM classification. Crosta et al. ( 1998) noticed that
    changes in the value of the threshold produced significant changes in the number
    of pixels classified as one of the reference spectrum. For that reason, we tested
    numerous threshold values for each case, and selected a value that resulted in
    the best classification compared with field data or conceptual valuation based
    on experiences. For the IKONOS images, the threshold value of 0.03 is the best
    value for both active crops and fallow land (table 2). For ETM+ images, the best
    values are 0.08–0.13 for active crops, and 0.05–0.06 for fallow land except for
    the ETM+ image of 12 September 1999. The endmembers of the 1999 image came directly
    from the image of 7 September 2000 due to being the same time of year. However,
    these endmembers worked very well for the year 2000 images, but did not work well
    for the 1999 image. As a complement, endmembers for the image of 1999 were readjusted
    by adding new endmembers and deleting some existing ones, and the threshold values
    were increased to be much larger than the previous threshold values used for the
    image of year 2000 (table 2). This experience suggests that (1) the training endmembers
    usually vary greatly for multi‐temporal images, even for the two images acquired
    in almost the same day (or month) in different years; and (2) there are limitations
    for any standard spectral library due to varying atmospheric and illumination
    conditions since perfect atmospheric correction is impossible. table 2 summarizes
    the key processes in the classification. figure 4 is the general work flow chart
    of SAM‐based classification procedure for using an ETM+ image. The non‐agricultural
    fields were all excluded from IKONOS and ETM+ images by using the mask created
    in §4.1. Figure 4 SAM‐based classification procedure using integrated remote sensing–GIS
    technology. Steps with dashed‐line frames are remote sensing methods, and steps
    with solid‐line frames are GIS methods. Display full size 4.3 NDVI‐based classification
    Vegetation indices have been widely used for tracking green biomass, leaf area
    index of crop canopies, and fractional amount of net radiation (Hatfield et al.
    1984; Daughtry et al. 1990, Jackson and Huete 1991, Kustas et al. 1993). NDVI
    is one of the most widely used indices for indicating the amount of green vegetation
    present in a pixel—higher NDVI values indicate more green vegetation (Jensen 1986,
    Jackson et al. 1988; Pinter et al. 2003). The NDVI method transforms multi‐spectral
    data (bands 3 and 4 of ETM+) into a single image representing the vegetation distribution
    by using equation (1) : where b 3 and b 4 are band 3 and band 4 of the ETM+ image,
    respectively. Valid results fall between −1 and +1. The larger the pixel value,
    the higher the fraction of vegetation cover within the pixel. After using the
    relative atmospheric correction (dark subtraction) method, many threshold values
    were examined against ground data. A threshold NDVI of 0.15 was found to produce
    the highest classification accuracy for separating vegetation cover from other
    land covers. The work flow chart in figure 5 describes the NDVI‐based classification
    scheme with GIS (ArcGIS) and remote sensing software (ENVI). The process with
    the NDVI‐based method as described in this flowchart is more time efficient than
    the one with the SAM method (figure 4). Using the SAM method is time consuming
    since the selection for training sites is labour intensive and depends on professional
    experiences. The NDVI method is efficient since it does not require training site
    selection. It is also computation efficient (several hours for classifying one
    image compared with 2–3 days with the SAM method since selecting the training
    site is labour intensive and needs professional experience). Figure 5 NDVI‐based
    classification procedure using integrated remote sensing–GIS technology. Steps
    1–8 (dashed‐line frames) are remote sensing methods, and steps 9–15 (solid‐line
    frames) are GIS methods. Display full size 5. Classification results and accuracy
    assessment The results produced from both supervised (SAM) and NDVI‐based classification
    approaches on multi‐temporal ETM+ images covering a period of 3 years (29 September
    1999, 10 June 2000, 7 September 2000, 26 April 2001, and 15 July 2001) are illustrated
    in tables 3 and 4, respectively. Since one scene of ETM+ image covers the entire
    county''s agriculture area, the classification result should reflect the actual
    situation in an irrigation rotation. Table 3. Classification results from SAM‐based
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table Table 4. Classification results from NDVI‐based
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table The classification using the SAM method resulted
    in 42 374 acres of active crops and 4826 acres of fallow lands for the ETM+ image
    of 15 July 2001 (table 3). The confusion matrix and ground data information were
    employed to assess the accuracy of the classifications. This was the only adopted
    imagery whose acquisition time matched the first of the three field data. figure
    6( a) shows the ground investigation on the image of 15 July 2001 (field data
    on 25 July), and figure 6( a) is the SAM classification result. The number of
    total pixels in the ground data was 8495 (figure 6( a)). All of the pixels are
    crop lands; there were no fallow land during this time (figure 2( a) and (b)).
    Of these, 7954 were correctly classified as crop lands in figure 6( b). The accuracy
    is 93.63%, and unclassified is 6.37%. Figure 6 The ground data(a) and classification
    result (b) of the ETM+ image on 15 July 2001. (a) Ground data result, with white
    as crops (see figure 2( b)); (b) is the classification result, with light grey
    as crops. Display full size Using the NDVI classification method (table 4) for
    the same image acquired in 15 July 2001, 42 168 acres of active crops and 5032
    acres of fallow lands were classified. The results from NDVI differencing matched
    well to the results of SAM classification (with 93.63% overall accuracy). figure
    7 shows the comparison of classification results of crop lands and their percentage
    differences based on SAM and NDVI from the five images. The percentage difference
    is calculated by the equation: where acresNDVI and acresSAM are acres of active
    crops classified using the NDVI and SAM methods, respectively. From the figure,
    it is clear that by using the SAM and NDVI methods, the classification accuracies
    are almost the same. The percentage of differences between two methods are from
    the minimum of ∼0% for the image for 15 July 2001 to the maximum of ∼12% for the
    image for 26 April 2001. Similar accuracy suggests that the more complex supervised
    SAM method did not show significant advantage over the NDVI differencing. In other
    words, the NDVI method jointly with a pre‐classification processing is sufficient
    for separating between active crops and fallow lands. In addition to accuracy
    assessment, the NDVI method requires only threshold values for transformation
    from NDVI to ROIs and a process of excluding non‐agricultural fields blended with
    agricultural areas. Therefore, the NDVI method is more straightforward to use
    compared to the SAM method. The differences between SAM and NDVI method are (1)
    SAM uses all available spectral bands such as six bands for the ETM+ image and
    four bands for the IKONOS image, while NDVI uses only two bands (bands 3 and 4
    for both ETM+ and IKONOS); and (2) SAM is a supervised classification method,
    requiring selection of training sites before classification, while NDVI does not.
    SAM is very good for a hyperspectral image (spectral resolution 20 nm or better)
    where hundreds of spectral bands (wavelengths) are used for classification, while
    NDVI only uses two spectral bands or wavelengths (red and near‐infrared), which
    does not represent the whole spectral picture of an object. For a multi‐spectral
    image (spectral resolution 200 nm or worse), however, only six or four bands are
    available. So it does not make too much difference whether the SAM or NDVI method
    is used, however the SAM method is complex in three aspects: Figure 7 Comparison
    of classification results of crop lands from SAM and NDVI and their differences
    in percentages. Display full size It requires ground investigation for selection
    of training sites, which is not always possible or convenient. For example, it
    is impossible to conduct ground investigation for images acquired in past years.
    So selecting training areas when using old images depends completely on the experience
    of an interpreter. This is the case of this study: four ETM+ images (before 15
    July 2001) and all IKONOS images. Collection of endmembers with the N‐dimensional
    visualizer in ENVI is an interactive tool depending largely on the knowledge of
    experts. The threshold value (the maximum angle) in the SAM method is very sensitive
    to the classification results. The threshold value selection requires exhaustive
    searching and the experience of an interpreter. On the other hand, the NDVI method
    does not have above deficiencies for the purpose of classifying crop lands from
    fallow lands, and will perform the same for any image no matter whether current
    or old, because NDVI does not involve the selection of training sites and it does
    not require a very experienced interpreter. So NDVI could provide better, reliable,
    and consistent accuracy of classification results for the purpose of water management.
    Having carried out the above analysis, we should point out that the supervised
    SAM classification is adequate for classifying different crops such as cotton,
    corn, and alfalfa if proper spectral resolution imagery is used. However in this
    case, all these different crops will be grouped into one class: active crops.
    The remaining objects are in fallow land. In other words, these two classes are
    either green or non‐green, which was accurately separated by the NDVI method.
    However, without the mask previously built, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy
    of classification from both NDVI and SAM methods based on the ETM+ imagery. The
    results of using SAM classification on the entire mosaicked IKONOS image did not
    match the real situation very well, because 386 scenes of IKONOS images were acquired,
    spanning a time period of different irrigation rotations (August 2000 to February
    2001). As an example, figure 8 shows the classification result by using the SAM
    method on IKONOS images. It was visually observed that crops in a field are not
    homogeneous (figure 8( a)). The SAM classification (figure 8( b)) overlaying on
    the IKONOS image could identify bare areas (patches) inside agricultural fields.
    These holes (patches) represent that these crops are in poor condition: less water,
    less fertility, more pests, or salt accumulation. Miyamoto ( 2000) concluded that
    most of these holes are due to salt accumulation, because the soil in these fields
    is silt clay, which has features such as inadequate soil permeability and lower
    water infiltration, especially when the soil is compacted or affected by sodium.
    The information is very useful in farming management such as watering, fertilizing,
    identifying presence of pests, or assessing water quality. In other words, it
    is useful to achieve precision agriculture. A disadvantage is that these holes
    could cause mis‐classification between a crop land in poor conditions and a fallow
    land. This suggests that the higher resolution of IKONOS imagery does not guarantee
    higher classification accuracy in this case. The results based on ETM+ imagery
    may ignore these holes and obtain better classification results except for those
    holes bigger than 30 m. Figure 8 Classification catches these holes (bare areas)
    inside fields. (a) The IKONOS image and (b) the classification results overlaying
    the image. Display full size 6. Conclusions This study evaluated a NDVI differencing
    method combined with pre‐processing to exclude non‐agricultural fields for mapping
    and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in order to improve irrigation
    management. The evaluation was based on Landsat ETM+ images and was through the
    comparison to a supervised classification method, namely SAM. The similar classification
    accuracies from the two methods demonstrated that the more advanced classification,
    the SAM approach, did not have a clear advantage compared to the method using
    NDVI at the level of distinguishing between active crops and fallow lands, except
    its potential to make more detailed classification, such as further classifying
    crops into corn, cotton and alfalfa. However, this potential capability of the
    SAM method came with the more complex processing (such as selection of training
    sites, N‐dimensional visualizer, selection of spectral endmembers, and post‐classification)
    and exhaustive searching for some proper threshold values (such as specifying
    the spectral angle threshold and sieve pixel threshold). The accurate classification
    from the relatively simple method of using NDVI differencing demonstrated that
    involving ancillary data in pre‐classification processing is an effective scheme
    for avoiding a complex classification method. Because it is accuracy‐reliable
    and cost‐effective, we recommend the NDVI method with pre‐processing to exclude
    some of the unwanted objects as a practical approach in mapping and measuring
    the acreage of active croplands for irrigation management and planning. A comparative
    test was also made to see if high spatial resolution remote sensing images would
    have significant advantages in extracting active crop lands from an agricultural
    region. By examining IKONOS and Landsat ETM+ images, it is clear that using ETM+
    instead of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate in this application.
    When using high resolution images it is difficult to handle the heterogeneity
    of agricultural fields, so salt and pepper effects are unavoidable (Yu et al.
    2006), such as wrong classification patches caused by water stress, by presence
    of pests, or by accumulation of salt. This result made this testing worthwhile,
    because using ETM+ would also have the advantage of avoiding the high cost of
    purchasing IKONOS images and would be an appropriate data source for irrigation
    management in arid or semi‐arid areas. The study provided valuable insights into
    selecting an appropriate classification method as well as a proper type of imagery
    for increasing classification accuracy, reducing complexity, enhancing computation
    efficiency, and maximizing the cost efficiency. Acknowledgements This project

  limitations: The paper lacks analysis of the effect of atmospheric conditions on
    the accuracy of the different methods, and it does not fully explore the potential
    for further subclassification of crops using the SAM method.

  title: Suitable remote sensing method and data for mapping and measuring active
    crop fields
  verbatim_quote1: '"The classification achieved an overall accuracy of 93.63%."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The result suggests that using ETM+ instead of IKONOS high spatial
    resolution imageries is appropriate because of the high cost of IKONOS imageries
    and image heterogeneity of agricultural fields.'
  verbatim_quote3: '"It was shown that pre‐processing with a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural
    objects blended with agricultural fields is critical."'

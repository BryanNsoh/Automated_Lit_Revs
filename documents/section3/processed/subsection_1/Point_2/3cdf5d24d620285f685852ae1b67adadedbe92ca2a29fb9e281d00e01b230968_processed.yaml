    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Water is an important
    resource and must be used efficiently. The agriculture sector is the main water
    consumer; it uses approximately 70% of all available water resources worldwide
    [1]. This sector’s consumption will be controlled if modern technology is adopted
    with traditional irrigation procedures, particularly flooding. However, in this
    sector, modern technologies are accepted only if they exhibit a sufficient potential
    to increase crop yield while preserving as many resources as possible [2]. At
    present, different activities, particularly irrigation, in agriculture are performed
    with traditional procedures that are time consuming, labor intensive, and wasteful
    [3]. The traditional agricultural paradigm was geared toward modern technology
    utilization in the last decade, and its acceptance ratio at the commercial level
    increased. Technology adaptation has led to the automation of different agriculture-related
    activities, and this automation is known as precision farming or precision agriculture
    in literature [4]. The main motivation is that crop quality and production rates
    will improve if the right resources are applied at the right time under suitable
    environmental conditions. Such mechanisms improve crop yield and conserve considerable
    resources, such as water, pesticide spray, and potassium. Different mechanisms
    are utilized to collect environmental parameters and soil features, such as moisture,
    salinity, pH, temperature, air humidity, and wind direction [5], [6]. Scientific
    and research organizations are eager to apply the potential of micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) technology and the overwhelming characteristics of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) in different application areas, including the military, intelligent
    buildings and bridges, medical field, industries, and precision agriculture [7]–[9].
    In precision agriculture, WSNs are deployed in fields to sense and report various
    parameters that are vital to plant growth. Initial experiments with WSNs in the
    agriculture sector have been conducted in controlled environments, such as greenhouses,
    in which sensors/actuators are deployed to control the indoor environment automatically
    [10], [11]. WSNs have also been utilized in different projects, such as automating
    greenhouses, efficient water utilization, and identification of crop diseases.
    Most of these studies used WSNs as data collection tools, and decision support
    systems (DSS) were responsible for actual decisions. After the successful deployment
    of WSNs in controlled environments, researchers and scientists explored their
    applications in open field environments, but such an exploration was challenging.
    As part of a LOFAR project, Baggio [12] deployed a small network of wireless nodes
    in potato fields to detect a fungal disease known as Phytophthora. A similar experimental
    study was performed as a joint project of Switzerland and India in [13]. Mancuso
    and Bustaffa [14] explored the potential of WSNs to control various tomato diseases
    and described how this technology helps in controlling such diseases. Burrell
    et al. [15] deployed sensor nodes in a vineyard to assist managers in handling
    different scenarios, frost risk, and specific location by providing valuable information
    continuously. The FLOW-AID project used WSN to identify water deficit situations,
    scenarios where plants are in desperate need of water [16]. In 2011, Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Information and Communication
    Technology utilized WSNs to help recover the ecological integrity of Queensland’s
    Spring Brook National Park and regenerate the rain forest from agricultural grassland
    [17]. Other experimental studies have been conducted recently, but their description
    is beyond the scope of this work. The literature on WSNs in the agriculture sector
    is robust, but most of the studies neglected an important issue associated with
    data generated by sensor nodes, namely, outliers. Outliers are noisy data generated
    by sensor nodes when a sensor is malfunctioning or generated because of interference
    or colliding packets. These data must be detected and corrected prior to examination
    by DSS. Existing noise detection algorithms are highly complex, and their implementation
    in real-time DSS, a system that operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, is
    difficult. Therefore, a simple mechanism that does not degrade the overall performance
    of real-time DSS is needed to detect outliers. Most existing studies are designed
    for sprinkler systems and are inapplicable to real agriculture environments where
    flooding mechanisms are generally used to irrigate crops; such a practice is particularly
    common in Asia. In this work, a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management
    system is developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The
    proposed system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes
    that are examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection
    algorithm is implemented to improve the system’s accuracy. Afterward, DSS further
    examines it to identify water deficient sites in agricultural fields. After identification,
    the alarming unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network
    (LAN) to inform farmers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, a brief overview of WSNs, particularly in the agriculture sector,
    is presented, followed by the proposed system architecture in Section III. Section
    IV describes the proposed outlier detection algorithm and its working mechanism.
    The different issues identified and solved during this study are presented in
    Section V. In Section VI, the achievements of the proposed approach are described,
    and a comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms is performed
    based on real-time and benchmark datasets. The last section provides the concluding
    remarks. SECTION II. WSN in Agriculture Sector The distinguishing characteristics
    of WSNs make this technology an ideal solution to various real-world problems.
    These problems arise in different domains, such as the military, medicine, telemetric,
    intelligent building, hazard environments, and agriculture [18]. In the agriculture
    sector, WSNs are used to assist farmers in different activities, such as irrigation
    (whether sprinkled or flooding), detection and prevention of crop diseases in
    early stages or preventing favorable occurrence conditions, water-deficient location
    identification, and duration of field monitoring and pesticide spraying [19].
    Various experimental studies on WSNs in the agriculture sector have addressed
    particular problems. The studies that are relevant to our work are presented in
    this part. WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses to control the dew condensation
    problem that arises due to temperature, air humidity, pressure, and other environmental
    factors [20]. Park et al used different sensor nodes to collect data and adjust
    greenhouse environments accordingly. To compute for dew condensation, they utilized
    a well-known Bahrenburg formula. In a joint project to determine the ratio of
    arsenic in underground water, a WSN was deployed in [21] to collect various soil
    parameters of a rice field, such as arsenic, soil moisture, temperature, calcium,
    carbonate, chloride, nitrate, and pH. The collected data were thoroughly examined
    in sophisticated laboratories to determine the required ratio. Similarly, sensor
    nodes were deployed in Malawi to collect pH, reduction/oxidation (redox), and
    turbidity values to determine the quality of water [22]. In Spain, WSN was deployed
    to monitor soil contents, such as moisture, salinity, pH, and temperature [23].
    This system was successfully implemented in a real agriculture environment, but
    the decisions were not automated. To describe how few sensor nodes covered a particular
    area, the authors wrote an expression that describes the relationship between
    shower nozzle capacity and sensor node radius [24]. Konstantinos et al. presented
    a WSN-based architecture to control environmental conditions in a commercial greenhouse.
    The collected data were thoroughly examined to find their correlation with crop
    conditions [25]. Proper seedling of watermelon relies on environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, air humidity, and light values. Sensor nodes were deployed
    in greenhouses to collect and examine desired information and assist farmers in
    proper seedling of watermelon. A process control strategy management system was
    also designed in previous studies to determine proper and automatic seedling of
    watermelon; its various components were WSN, DSS, RFID-based method, and queuing
    theory-based algorithm [26], [27]. Phytophthora is a potato fungal disease that
    occurs due to certain environmental conditions, and if these conditions are prevented/avoided,
    then the possibility of the disease’s existence will become negligible. Baggio
    [12] utilized a WSN to collect desired data and attempted to avoid conditions
    that are favorable for the disease. Similarly, WSNs were deployed in potato fields
    by Shinghal et al. [3] to improve productivity. Favorable conditions for tomato
    diseases were avoided by using WSNs inside greenhouses [14]. In vineyards, sensor
    nodes were deployed in different locations to collect valuable data that were
    used for predicting various diseases, pest control, and facilitating the handling
    of different activities [15]. Kotamäki et al. [28] deployed a WSN near a river
    basin to determine the quality of water and described its effects on soil content
    and crop yield. The Common Sense Net Project was designed for marginal farming
    in India, in which different sensor nodes were used to identify areas whose water,
    rain, reservation capacities were high. Additionally, the project can identify
    various crop diseases [13]. The Flow AID Project was designed to utilize the WSN’s
    potentials in determining water-deficient sites in agriculture fields [16]. Dursun
    and Ozden [29] presented an automatic drip irrigation management system for cherry
    trees. Pardossi et al. [30] described a mechanism to integrate rote zone sensors
    with WSN and used it in the identification of water deficit situations. Various
    investigations on automatic control of greenhouses were reported in [4], [31],
    and [32]. Different site-specific automatic irrigation management systems were
    presented in [33]–[36]. SECTION III. Proposed System Architecture and Deployment
    A. Architecture Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed DSS. In the proposed
    architecture, an application layer is designed to provide services to farmers
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). These services include
    interaction with the real-time system, identification of water-deficient locations,
    vulnerable situation alarms, and environmental monitoring. The middle layer describes
    how various components of the proposed system interact with one another, physically
    or logically, to provide the desired services precisely. The sensor manager unit
    collects data from sensors and forwards these to a microprocessor that conducts
    aggregation for further processing. The gateway module receives packets from sensor
    nodes, and is attached to a computer that runs the proposed DSS. DSS collects
    the newly arrived packets from the gateway module, checks their accuracy through
    a noise detection module, decides the current situation, and stores it. The physical
    layer directly interacts with the environment. Sensor nodes that use various sensing
    capabilities collect soil moisture, air humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness
    data and send the data to the sensor manager. These parameters are vital in the
    development of a precise DSS for irrigation. FIGURE 1. Architecture of the proposed
    DSS. Show All Real-time systems need to be continuously operational to assist
    farmers, but at the same time, the sensor node sampling rate must be adjusted
    accordingly to prolong the WSN’s lifetime. In our testbed, wasp-mote agriculture
    sensor boards with desired functionality were programmed and deployed in a real
    agriculture environment, namely, an orange orchard. During the first phase of
    the experimental setup, the boards were placed in close proximity to reduce packet
    losses, thereby improving communication reliability. In the second phase, the
    boards were placed to cover as much area as possible, and each node can communicate
    with the gateway either directly or through multi-hop communication. Their transceivers
    use the Xbee protocol and can communicate within a 500 m range. Nod e 3 was deployed
    within the direct communication range of the gateway (460 m), and Nod e 1 and
    Nod e 2 were placed at a distance of 460 m from Node3. The distance between the
    nodes and gateway was kept small to maximize their throughput. The proposed DSS
    performance is not affected by increasing or decreasing scalability of sensor
    nodes because these nodes act as data collection points. Dense deployment increases
    data packets, but this situation is not an issue, particularly in the agriculture
    sector, in which the sampling rate of the deployed sensor nodes must be very low,
    namely, two or three packets per 24 hours. B. Wasp-Mote Boards Deployment The
    implementation of a precise real-time DSS in any application depends on the selection
    of appropriate technology, sensors, and parameters to be monitored. Sensor board
    selection is based on coverage area, battery lifetime, processing capability,
    transceiver, and integration of sensors. Parameter selection is application-specific.
    In our study, we considered soil and environmental parameters. Soil moisture is
    vital in the development of a precise irrigation schedule; that is, if the sensed
    value is below a threshold value, then this area needs water and must be irrigated.
    For this purpose, soil moisture sensors were deployed at three different levels
    in the agricultural field, as shown in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3. In addition to the
    soil moisture parameter, an atmospheric moister exerts drastic effects on the
    watering schedules of various crops and must be monitored regularly. These sensors
    are deployed in close proximity to plant leaves, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally,
    temperature and humidity parameters are significant in the design of a precise
    DSS because the soil moisture threshold value is directly proportional to the
    environmental temperature. Therefore, these sensors are integrated with wasp-mote
    boards to collect their full potential, as shown in Fig. 5. The gateway module
    is connected to a computer to receive data and process them. FIGURE 2. Deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in orange orchard. Show All FIGURE 3. Deployment soil
    moisture sensor in real agricultural environment. Show All FIGURE 4. Leaf wetness
    sensor deployment near plant leaves. Show All FIGURE 5. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors deployment. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed Decision Support System The
    proposed system collects soil and environmental parameters through its deployed
    WSN in the orange orchard. Initially, the collected data are examined by the concerned
    board to minimize redundant packets via aggregation, and the data are transferred
    to the destination via a gateway. The data sensed by four different sensors are
    merged into one packet to increase the efficiency of the proposed system in terms
    of energy consumption. These packets are forwarded to the outlier detection module
    where their accuracy is checked and sent to DSS for onward processing if found
    correct. DSS thoroughly examines these packets by comparing different parameters
    with their defined threshold values, particularly soil moisture (250 Hz).The threshold
    values such as soil moisture (250Hz), are determined through deploying the sensors
    (3) in dry soil; and collecting their readings over a period of three days. If
    the data are in the defined range, then they are stored in a database; otherwise,
    the alarm unit is activated, and alert messages are forwarded to the LAN or mobile
    phone. The GUI of the proposed system shows collected data in graphical and textual
    formats. The operation of the proposed system is summarized in Fig. 6. FIGURE
    6. Working of the proposed system. Show All A. Proposed Outliers Detection Algorithm
    Outliers are data packets generated by a malfunctioning sensor or via interference
    and collision. WSNs are highly susceptible to outliers due to various restrictions
    on their size, processing, and transceivers. The literature on outlier/noise detection
    is bulky, but most of the approaches were presented and validated based on static
    datasets, and their implementation in a real-time system is difficult or impractical.
    These algorithms improve dataset accuracy but equally degrade the overall performance
    of a real-time system because for every packet, the mechanism repeatedly searches
    the entire dataset [37], [38]. Moreover, the accuracy of these algorithms is directly
    proportional to dataset size and computation time. Their accuracy for large datasets
    is extremely high, but the computation time is also high and results in low performance
    of DSS, particularly in a real-time system. Therefore, a simplified outlier detection
    algorithm was developed to overcome these issues and improve the performance of
    real-time DSS and dataset accuracy. The performance of a real-time system based
    on the proposed outlier detection algorithm is unaffected by dataset size because
    the algorithm does not scan the overall dataset and considers the most recent
    packets only. Its computation time and performance are exceptionally good in real-time
    datasets, and it is equally applicable to static datasets. Algorithm 1 starts
    by matching the currently received packet with the previously stored one, which
    is the last accurate packet, that is, the packet received at time T i and T i−1
    . If their difference is less than the defined threshold value (10 Hz for the
    soil moisture sensor), then it is forwarded to the DSS for further analysis. However,
    if their difference crosses the defined limit, then it is either an outlier or
    an abrupt change scenario that occurs because of direct connection of water with
    soil moisture sensors. In this case, data are stored temporarily, and further
    processing is delayed until the next packet from that particular node arrives.
    Then, the recently received packet is compared with two packets, namely, the one
    that is temporarily stored and the last packet stored in the database. For example,
    data collected at time T 3 are matched with data received at time T 2 and stored
    temporarily, and data gathered at time T 1 is successfully stored. If the difference
    between packets received at T 3 and T 1 is less than the defined threshold value,
    then the data packet received at T 2 is an outlier and replaced with the average
    value of data packets T 1 and T 3 . However, if the difference between data packets
    T 2 and T 3 is less than the threshold value, then it is an abrupt change scenario,
    and both values are stored in the database. Algorithm 1 Proposed Outliers Detection

    21: else 22: Temp−Locatio n i ← Cur-Pkt 23: Outliers-ID ← 1 24: end if We consider
    Fig. 7 in which the soil moisture value received at time 13:00 is 0 Hz, representing
    the most recent packet. The packet collected at time 12:30, 850 Hz, is the last
    accurate value stored in the database. These two values are matched, and their
    difference is much larger than the threshold value, which is 10 Hz in our case.
    Therefore, this packet is temporarily stored, and the decision is delayed until
    the next packet from the same node, Nod e 1 , arrives. When the next packet at
    time 13:30 is received, it is matched with the packet collected at time 12:30
    or with most recently stored packet. The difference between these packets is below
    the threshold value, 1 Hz, indicating that the temporarily stored packet is an
    outlier and must be replaced with the average value of data packets that arrived
    at times 12:30 and 13:30 (840 Hz). Then, both values are stored in the database,
    and the data are as shown in Fig. 8. In this scenario, a real-time DSS that does
    not use the outlier detection mechanism activates the alarm unit for the water
    deficit condition and sends a text message over LAN because the soil moisture
    value is less than the threshold value. However, smart DSS, which possesses outlier
    detection facility, easily handles this situation. Another debatable scenario
    for real-time DSS in the agricultural environment is the separation of the abrupt
    change that occurs because of the direct connection of water with a soil moisture
    sensor, as shown in Fig. 8 at time 15:30. The proposed algorithm handles this
    situation through a similar mechanism described for the detection of outliers.
    However, in this case, the temporarily stored value and the currently received
    value are identical or approximate each other. Both values are stored in the database
    without modification. FIGURE 7. A scenario of both outliers and abrupt change.
    Show All FIGURE 8. Outliers free scenario. Show All SECTION V. Issues Resolved
    During Proposed Experimental Setup During the deployment phase of the proposed
    testbed, various issues were identified and resolved. A. Packets Collision and
    Nodes Overhearing A sensor node uses a broadcasting mechanism to communicate with
    the gateway and other nodes in the network, thereby resulting in the collision
    of packets or reduction of throughput. Collision usually occurs due to the concurrent
    communication of sensor nodes deployed in close proximity or within the communication
    range of one another. In the proposed testbed, a simplified mechanism, namely,
    delay timers in wasp-mote boards, is used to avoid concurrent communication of
    sensor nodes and collision. Every experimental setup uses a sampling rate or a
    sensor node rate of transmission, which is 30 minutes in our case. The criteria
    for packet transmission of every node are adjusted according to the neighbor node
    communication schedules. For example, if nod e 1 begins communication with other
    nodes or the gateway at time 10:00:00, then its neighbor nodes must wait for the
    maximum propagation delay; that is, the time required for successful communication
    between the most widely separated nodes (approximately 5 seconds in the proposed
    experimental setup). Therefore, nod e 2 , a neighboring node of nod e 1 , must
    delay its communication for 3 seconds and start around 10:00:04 if its neighbors
    are not interested in transmission. However, this mechanism works only for a testbed
    in which a limited number of sensor nodes are used. For dense WSNs, other mechanisms,
    such as channelization, are utilized. Overhearing of a sensor node in WSNs exerts
    drastic effects on node lifetime and needs to be handled efficiently, particularly
    in highly dense networks. To avoid this problem, sensor nodes are placed in such
    a manner that each node has at most one path for communication with the gateway
    and does not hear other neighboring nodes where feasible. In our case, the problem
    was successfully solved through manual adjustment of the distance between sensor
    nodes. However, this method is useful only in the engineered setup of WSN only
    and is not feasible for random deployment. This technique introduces the path
    loss problem in large networks, but it is efficient for small networks. B. Crops
    Canopy Crop canopy is another important problem associated with the deployment
    of WSNs in agricultural fields, particularly orchards. Crop canopy affects the
    communication range of sensor nodes in a network and environmental parameters.
    During the initial phase of our project, the problem was not considered, and nodes
    were deployed randomly at different locations but within the direct communication
    range of the gateway module. However, only nod e 3 packets were received successfully,
    and the remaining node packets were lost due to crop canopy. Further analysis
    of the experimental setup and field was performed, and different alternatives
    were applied to resolve this issue. This thorough investigation led us to the
    problem of crop canopy and its effects on the communication range of sensor nodes
    because nod e 1 was in the direct line of sight with the sink node, whereas the
    other nodes were not. Obstacles or orange trees were also present. Therefore,
    nodes were deployed in the orange orchard in such a manner that each node was
    in the direct line of sight with its intended receiver node. Node deployment in
    direct line of sight does not necessarily mean that nodes are unable to communicate
    when obstacles exist between transmitting and receiving nodes. Nodes placed in
    the crop canopy can communicate, but their coverage area and transmission range
    are much smaller than those in the direct line of sight communication. Another
    issue caused by crop canopy was the effects on sensor node readings, particularly
    sensors that collect environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity). In summer,
    nodes deployed in a shady region generate temperature readings of 40 °C– 44 °C,
    whereas sensors exposed to sunlight sense temperatures in a range of 44 °C– 49
    °C. To overcome this problem, 50% of the sensor nodes were deployed in direct
    sunlight, and the remaining nodes were placed in shady areas. C. Effects of Heavy
    Rain Heavy rain is vital to plant growth rate, particularly in summer when watering
    requirements are high. In traditional approaches, flooding/watering schedules
    are postponed due to heavy rain and particularly based on farmers’ experience.
    Therefore, the proposed DSS must handle this scenario in a manner similar to traditional
    approaches but without requiring an experienced farmer to monitor the system and
    judge its decisions. In the proposed DSS, the decision whether to irrigate or
    not is primarily based on soil moisture content and other supplementary parameters.
    In the case of heavy rain, soil moisture sensor readings exceed the threshold
    value, clearly indicating that the irrigation schedule must be deferred. Similarly,
    conducting specific case studies for every season is not needed because if soil
    moisture content values are above the threshold value, then irrigation is unnecessary.
    Additionally, the proposed system possesses the flexibility to adjust threshold
    values whenever required and can be used in different agricultural scenarios.
    D. WSNs Lifetime An important aspect of the applicability of WSNs in different
    application areas is their lifetime, which mostly relies on the onboard batteries
    of sensor nodes. Efficient utilization of available power resources increases
    WSN lifetime. In the proposed testbed, sensor nodes actively probe the environment
    for the shortest duration of 1 minute and then switch to sleep mode for approximately
    29 minutes. Every board conducts aggregation of the data collected by its sensors
    and merges the data into a single packet. The aggregation approach combines the
    data gathered through temperature, air humidity, soil moisture and leaf wetness
    sensors into a single data packet. The aggregation mechanism reduces the number
    of transmitted packets from 4 to 1, and individual packets for every sensor are
    attached to a wasp-mote board, thereby improving the lifetime of WSNs. Additionally,
    in the agriculture sector, particularly in the watering schedules of open field
    crops, collection of data once or even twice a day is appropriate or needed. Therefore,
    the sampling rate of deployed nodes must be decreased to 12 hours or more to further
    increase WSN lifetime. SECTION VI. Results and Discussion In the case of real-time
    data, the worst case complexity of the proposed outlier detection algorithm is
    O(1), whereas pattern anomaly value (PAV), MPAV, and rare pattern drift detector
    (RPDD) algorithms [37], [38] have complexities of O( n 2 ) , O(n) and O( n 2 +n)
    respectively. Hence, the proposed algorithm is the best solution among these algorithms
    for real-time DSS because it does not affect the functionality of DSS. Similarly,
    the proposed algorithm’s worst case complexity for a static dataset is O(n) ,
    where n represents size of the dataset. These algorithms were tested on real-time
    data obtained via our testbed deployed in an orange orchard. The performance of
    the algorithms in terms of computational time is presented in Fig. 9, which shows
    that the proposed algorithm outperformed contemporary schemes. Moreover, the performance
    of these algorithms was examined thoroughly by continuously increasing the dataset
    size. Unlike the proposed algorithm, the other schemes were inconsistent with
    the dynamically changing dataset. In the case of the real-time dataset, the computational
    time of the other algorithms was directly proportional to the size of the dataset,
    whereas the proposed algorithm was not affected. Moreover, the proposed algorithm’s
    memory requirements were fewer than those of the other algorithms. The implementation
    of these complex algorithms in real-time DSS required highly sophisticated and
    demanding technology, which is expensive, whereas the proposed algorithm worked
    well with existing technology. The algorithms were also tested on a static dataset,
    and their computation time is depicted in Fig. 10. Our algorithm’s performance
    was better than that of the other algorithms, particularly in terms of execution
    time. FIGURE 9. Computational time comparison on real time data set. Show All
    FIGURE 10. Computational time comparison on static data set. Show All The complexity
    of an algorithm is vital to its development, implementation, and execution in
    real-time systems. Complexity is directly proportional to algorithm accuracy and
    computation time. In real-time DSS specifically for the agriculture sector, an
    algorithm must be as accurate and simple as possible so the overall performance
    of DSS is unaffected. If the algorithm is accurate and precise but degrades the
    overall performance of the system, then it is useless. An accuracy comparison
    is presented in Fig. 11. Although the proposed algorithm’s accuracy is lower than
    that of the other algorithms, its effect on the overall performance of real-time
    DSS was smaller, and the algorithm works on a personal computer. Improving the
    accuracy and precision of an algorithm results in increased complexity, degradation
    of the overall performance of the real-time system, and inability to run efficiently
    on personal computers. FIGURE 11. DSS’s accuracy. Show All In addition to the
    real-time dataset, the algorithms were examined thoroughly by using benchmark
    datasets, as shown in Table 1. The execution time of the proposed algorithm was
    less than that of the other algorithms specifically for dynamic datasets. The
    proposed algorithm is an ideal candidate for an efficient real-time DSS. The precision
    and accuracy of these algorithms on the benchmark datasets are presented in Table
    2. Accuracy is described in terms of accurate decisions taken by DSS when these
    algorithms were implemented as a separate module to fine tune data before processing.
    The proposed algorithm is not precise for datasets that possess multi-valued noise,
    such as the FacesUCR dataset. However, when datasets have single-valued outliers
    only, the proposed algorithm is ideal. TABLE 1 Comparative Computation Time of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets TABLE 2 Comparative Accuracy of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets A real-time decision support system
    was designed in this study to facilitate farmers in various agriculture-related
    activities. Farmers will adopt a technology-assisted system if it has a simplified
    interaction paradigm, possesses a simple GUI, and provides the desired services.
    The proposed DSS possesses a user-friendly interface that is can be easily understood
    by inexperienced users and provides different services simultaneously, as shown
    in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. A sample screen shot of the proposed system showing data
    of soil moisture sensor. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The
    demand for efficient utilization of available water resources, specifically in
    the agriculture sector, is increasing daily due to water scarcity and global climate
    change. Therefore, technology-assisted irrigation mechanisms, sensors, and actuators
    must be realized in real agriculture environments. These approaches provide water
    upon demand and control water wastage. They are helpful in controlling water resources
    but exert drastic effects on plant growth rate and yield. In this work, we developed
    a technology-assisted outlier detection and decision support system (DSS) to facilitate
    irrigation, particularly flooding. The proposed system is highly precise because
    it uses an embedded outlier detection module that thoroughly examines the correctness
    of the collected data and forwards the data to DSS for further processing. DSS
    analyzes different parameters to identify water-deficient sites and reports them
    to farmers or generates an alarm. This system possesses a user-friendly interaction
    environment that makes it easy to use. In the future, we will further improve
    the accuracy of the proposed DSS by examining additional parameters and will enhance
    it to assist farmers in other agriculture-related activities, such as pesticide
    and fertilizer use and determination of soil properties. Furthermore, due to nodes
    un-availability and their security issues, the proposed scheme was evaluated only
    on three sensor nodes. As a future work, we will investigate the proposed algorithm
    on a large-scale. ACKNOWLEDGMENT All authors declare that they have no conflict

  verbatim_quote1: This paper presents an efficient methodology that employs WSN as
    a data collection tool and a decision support system (DSS). The proposed DSS can
    assist farmers in their manual irrigation procedures or automate irrigation activities.
    Water-deficient sites in both scenarios are identified by using soil moisture
    and environmental data sensors.
  verbatim_quote2: A simplified outlier-detection algorithm is thus presented and
    integrated with the proposed DSS to fine-tune the collected data prior to processing.
    The complexity of the algorithm is O(1) for dynamic datasets generated by sensor
    nodes and O(n) for static datasets.

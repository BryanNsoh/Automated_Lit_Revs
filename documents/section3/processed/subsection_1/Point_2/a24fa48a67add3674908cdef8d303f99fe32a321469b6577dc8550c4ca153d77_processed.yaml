    Review

    * Remote sensing is generally considered one of the most important technologies
    for Precision

    Agriculture and Smart Farming. It is commonly used for monitoring cultivated ﬁelds,
    providing

    effective solutions for Precision Agriculture in the last 35 years [3]. Remote
    sensing can monitor many

    crop and vegetation parameters through images at various wavelengths.

    * In the past, remote sensing was often based on satellite images [4,5] or images
    acquired by using

    manned aircraft in order to monitor vegetation status at speciﬁc growth stages.
    However, satellite imagery

    is often not the best option because of the low spatial resolution of images acquired
    and the restrictions of the temporal resolutions as satellites are not always
    available to capture the necessary images. In addition, it is often required to
    wait long periods between acquisition and reception of images. In addition, environmental

    conditions, such as clouds, often hinder their reliable use. Considering the use
    of manned aircrafts,

    usually it results in high costs, and many times it is not possible to carry out
    multiple ﬂights to obtain

    more than a few crop images.

    * The development of UAV-based remote sensing systems have taken remote sensing
    and Precision

    Agriculture one step further. The use of UAVs to monitor crops offers great possibilities
    to acquire

    field data in an easy, fast and cost-effective way compared to previous methods.
    UAV-based

    monitoring systems have high temporal resolution as they can be used at the user’s
    will. This enhances

    the ﬂexibility of the image acquisition process. In addition, UAVs are a lot simpler
    to use and also

    cheaper than manned aircrafts. Moreover, they are more efﬁcient than the ground
    systems as they can

    cover a large ﬁeld in a short amount of time and in a non-destructive way, which
    is very important.

    frequent in the last years and it is considered the future of remote sensing,\
    \ it is a ﬁeld that draws a\nlot of attention. Thus, several reviews exist for\
    \ their application in Precision Agriculture and Smart\nFarming. Most of the reviews\
    \ focus mainly on the different types of applications that UAVs can have in\n\
    agricultural crops [7–12] or environmental monitoring in general [13]. In [14],\
    \ the authors reviewed the\nhyperspectral imagery and the techniques used in these\
    \ cases. Maes et al. [15] focused on the suitability\nof the different available\
    \ sensors for each application, providing with important perspectives for the\n\
    use of UAVs in PA. However, this work does not review the techniques used for\
    \ exploiting the acquired\ninformation. In addition, a survey that discusses the\
    \ use of Deep Learning in agricultural data has\nbeen conducted [16].\nTo the\
    \ best of the authors knowledge, a review focusing also on the most frequently\
    \ used\ntechniques exploiting and processing UAV imagery from agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ is currently missing from\nthe literature, despite its necessity. We believe\
    \ that it is very important mainly because the absence of a\nstandardized workﬂow\
    \ is one of the major drawbacks that affects the wider use of UAV systems in\n\
    commercial PA applications. This fact results in the adoption of a variety of\
    \ heterogeneous procedures\nand methods by different researchers, for the same\
    \ goal. This results to not always having the best\noutcome. Furthermore, we believe\
    \ that a study reviewing the most recent works is of paramount\nimportance, as\
    \ it is a research area that is advancing really quickly. In this work we extend\

    \ about UAV-based applications for PA, focusing on the most common\ntechniques\

    The goal is to identify the most used sensors and practices for each type of application.\n\
    To properly perform a review on UAV applications in Precision Agriculture, we\
    \ formulated the\nfollowing research questions (RQs):\n1.\nWhich are the different\
    \ types of UAV applications in Precision Agriculture? In this research\nquestion,\
    \ we aim to explore the current trends in the application of UAVs in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe initial goal of UAVs in their early application in agriculture\
    \ was to derive direct image-based\nproducts.\nNowadays, this has changed, and\
    \ the applications of UAVs in agriculture are\nintelligence-based oriented products\
    \ that process images and provide informed decision-making\napplications to the\
    \ farmers. In this question, we provide a thorough description of the different\n\
    types of applications that UAVs can support based on the different operational\
    \ needs of\nagriculture ﬁelds.\n2.\nWhat types of crops are monitored by UAV systems?\
    \ In this research question, our target is\nto record the different types of crops\
    \ that have been monitored so far with the help of UAVs.\nAdditionally, we provide\
    \ general information regarding the geographical distribution of these\ncrops,\
    \ their size and the different stages of growth where monitoring can take place.\
    \ By answering\nthis research question, we can identify how the different characteristics\
    \ of each crop and its life\ncycle affect the use of UAVs.\n3.\nWhich UAV system\
    \ technologies are adopted in Precision Agriculture?\nIn this research\nquestion,\
    \ we identify the system characteristics of UAV-based applications for Precision\n\
    Agriculture. By answering this question we can locate the speciﬁc UAV types and\
    \ sensors\nthat can be used for monitoring crops.\n4.\nWhat types of data can\

    Which data processing methods can be used to exploit the agricultural data acquired\
    \ by UAVs?\nIn this research question, we identify the methods that are used for\
    \ image analysis in agricultural\ncrops. We distinguish between three types of\
    \ data processing methods that can be used alone or\ncomplementary so as to gain\
    \ insights regarding a ﬁeld namely: (a) Photogrammetric techniques;\n(b) Machine\
    \ Learning techniques; and (c) Vegetation Indices.\nTo answer these research questions,\
    \ we reviewed 100 recent papers [18–117] published during the\n2017–2019 period.\n\
    The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic\
    \ UAV-based applications\nfor Precision Agriculture, including the types of crops\
    \ being monitored, the application domains and\nthe UAV technologies being used\
    \ for Precision Agriculture purposes. In Section 3, we focus on the\nbasics of\

    \ the most\nused image processing methods that stood out in the literature: the\
    \ photogrammetry techniques, the\nvegetation indices calculation and machine learning.\
    \ Next, Section 5 focuses on the limitations in the\nuse of UAVs for Precision\
    \ Agriculture. Finally, Section 6 discusses the results of the review and make\n\
    some concluding remarks.\n2. UAV-Based Monitoring of Crops\nIn this section, we\
    \ introduce the applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, along with the\n\
    types of crops being monitored and the UAV technologies adopted.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n4 of 26\n2.1. Types of UAV Applications in Precision Agriculture\n\
    To date, UAV technologies have been successfully employed in a variety of applications\
    \ for\nPrecision Agriculture such as site-speciﬁc herbicide applications, water\
    \ deﬁciency identiﬁcation,\ndetection of diseases, etc. Using the information\
    \ acquired by the UAVs several decisions can be made\nto handle the problem(s)\
    \ detected and/or optimize harvesting by estimating the yield.\nThe most common\
    \ applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, as recorded in the literature,\n\
    are the following:\n•\nWeed mapping and management [70,98]\n•\nVegetation growth\
    \ monitoring and yield estimation [48,65,87]\n•\nVegetation health monitoring\
    \ and diseases detection [46,77]\n•\nIrrigation management [64,118]\n•\nCorps\
    \ spraying [89,95]\nAmong the most popular application of UAVs in Precision Agriculture\
    \ is Weed mapping.\nWeeds are not desirable plants, which grow in agricultural\
    \ crops and can cause several problems.\nThey are competing for available resources\
    \ such as water or even space, causing losses to crop yields\nand in their growth.\
    \ In addition to the problems in the growth of the crops, weeds can cause problems\n\
    at harvesting. The use of herbicides is the dominant choice for weed control.\
    \ In conventional farming,\nthe most common practice of weed management is to\
    \ spray the same amounts of herbicides over the\nentire ﬁeld, even within the\
    \ weed-free areas. However, the overuse of herbicides can result in the\nevolution\
    \ of herbicide-resistant weeds and it can affect the growth and yield of the crops.\
    \ In addition,\nit poses a heavy pollution threat to the environment. In addition,\
    \ the above practice signiﬁcantly\nincreases the cost. To overcome the above problems,\
    \ in Precision Agriculture practices, Site-Speciﬁc\nWeed Management (SSWM) is\
    \ used. SSWM refers to the spatially variable application of herbicides\nrather\
    \ than spraying them in the whole ﬁeld. In this context, the ﬁeld is divided into\
    \ management\nzones that each one receives a customized management, as usually\
    \ weed plants spread through only\nfew spots of the ﬁeld. To achieve this goal,\
    \ it is necessary to generate an accurate weed cover map for\nprecise spraying\
    \ of herbicide. UAVs can gather images and derive data from the whole ﬁeld that\
    \ can\nbe used to generate a precise weed cover map depicting the spots where\
    \ the chemicals are needed:\n(a) the most; (b) the least; or (c) they should not\
    \ be applied at all.\nUAVs are also frequently used for Monitoring the growth\
    \ of the vegetation and providing\nestimation regarding the yield. The lack of\
    \ means for systematically monitoring the progress of\ncultivation is considered\
    \ as one of the major obstacles to increasing the agricultural productivity\n\
    and quality. This problem is also compounded by the variability of weather conditions\
    \ that alter the\nmicro-climate of crops jeopardizing the agricultural production.\
    \ Regular collection of information\nand visualization of crops using UAVs, provides\
    \ increased opportunities to monitor crop growth\nand record the variability observed\
    \ in several parameters of the ﬁeld. Many recent works focus on\nmonitoring the\
    \ biomass and nitrogen status of the crops along with yield estimation. Biomass\
    \ is the\nmost common crop parameter, which together with information related\
    \ to nitrogen content can be\nused to determine the need for additional fertilizer\
    \ or other actions. In addition, the information\nacquired by the UAVs can be\
    \ used for the creation of three-dimensional digital maps of the crop, and\nfor\
    \ the measurement of various parameters, such as crop height, distance between\
    \ rows or between\nplants, and the index Leaf Area Index (LAI). UAVs offer the\
    \ potential to systematically collect crop\ninformation, therefore farmers can\
    \ plan in a controlled manner the crop management, use of inputs\n(e.g., use of\
    \ nutrients), timing of harvesting and soil and yield pathogens, or even identify\
    \ possible\nmanagement errors.\nUAVs are also used to monitor vegetation health.\
    \ Crop health is a very important factor that\nneeds to be monitored, as diseases\
    \ in crops can cause signiﬁcant economic loss due to the reduced yield\nand the\
    \ reduction of quality. Crops should be monitored constantly to detect the diseases\
    \ in time and\navoid spreading problems. Traditionally, this task is performed\
    \ by human experts directly in the ﬁeld.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n5 of 26\n\
    However, this can be very time consuming, as it can require months to inspect\
    \ an entire crop preventing\nthe potentials of “continuous” monitoring. Another\
    \ common disease control method is the application\nof pesticides in certain dates.\
    \ Such a strategy incurs a high cost and also increases the likelihood of\nground\
    \ water contamination as pesticide residues in the products. In Precision Agriculture,\
    \ site-speciﬁc\ndisease control takes place. PA practices adopt a decision-based\
    \ disease management strategy, in which\nautomated non-destructive crops disease\
    \ detection plays a very important role. Disease detection\nis feasible as diseases\
    \ induce changes in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the crops.\n\
    UAV-based data processing technologies use crop imaging information to identify\
    \ changes in plant\nbiomass and their health. Therefore, diseases can be detected\
    \ in their early stages enabling farmers\nto intervene in order to reduce losses.\
    \ In this context, UAVs can be used in the two different stages\nof disease control:\
    \ (a) at the initial stage of infection by collecting crop health relevant information,\n\
    during which UAVs can detect a possible infection before visual indications appear\
    \ and map the size of\nthe infection to different parts of a culture; and (b)\
    \ during the treatment of infection when farmers can\nuse UAVs for targeted spraying\
    \ as well as for accurately monitoring the course of their intervention.\nCrop\
    \ irrigation management is a very important area of application of UAV technologies\
    \ in\nPrecision Agriculture. Currently, 70% of the water consumed worldwide is\
    \ used for the irrigation of\ncrops [119,120], a fact that highlights the need\
    \ for precision irrigation techniques. Precision irrigation\ntechniques can improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of water use, so that the resource is applied effectively: (a)\
    \ in\nthe right places; (b) at the right time; and (c) in the right quantity.\
    \ The detection of the areas where\nmajor irrigation is needed can help the farmers\
    \ to save time and water resources. At the same time,\nsuch precision farming\
    \ techniques can lead to increased crop productivity and quality. In the context\n\
    of precision agriculture, the ﬁeld is divided in different irrigation zones, to\
    \ precisely manage the\nresources. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles incorporating\
    \ suitable sensor types makes it possible\nto identify parts of a crop that need\
    \ more water. At the same time, the above technologies allow for the\nproduction\
    \ of specialized maps that illustrate the morphology of the soil, thus supporting\
    \ the more\nefﬁcient irrigation planning of each crop separately.\nAn application\
    \ of UAVs in precision agriculture that is more rarely met is Crop spraying. The\
    \ main\nspraying equipment used in conventional farming are the manual air-pressure\
    \ and battery-powered\nknapsack sprayers. However, these conventional sprayers\
    \ can cause major pesticide losses. In addition,\nthe operators need to be present\
    \ when spraying, which leads to exposure of the operators. In addition,\nit may\
    \ be time-consuming to spray the entire ﬁeld, which is not only limiting the resources\
    \ but also can\nlead to not-timely spraying. In this manner, UAVs can be useful\
    \ due to the lower operator exposure\nand improved ability to apply chemicals\
    \ in a timely and highly spatially resolved manner. The use\nof precision systems\
    \ for measuring distances allows UAVs to follow the morphology of the ground,\n\
    keeping their height constant. Therefore, an aircraft has the ability to spray\
    \ the appropriate amount\nof herbicide spatially, adjusting both its height and\
    \ the amount it sprays depending on the crop site\nin which it is located. Crop\
    \ spraying is particularly important in cases where diseases have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ where it is important to reduce pesticide use without affecting crop yield.\
    \ In conclusion,\nUAV-based systems can make a decisive contribution to crop spray\
    \ management.\nIn addition to the common applications mentioned above, UAVs have\
    \ also been used for soil\nanalysis [108,112], cotton genotype selection [48],\
    \ mammal detection [24], and assessment of soil\nelectrical conductivity [66].\n\
    2.2. Types and Properties of Crops Monitored by UAV-Based Systems\nIn the recent\
    \ years, UAV technologies have been employed to monitor a variety of different\
    \ types\nof crops, located in several countries all over the world. UAV applications\
    \ in Precision Agriculture\nhave been carried out in 29 different countries. The\
    \ majority of applications are located in economically\ndeveloped countries, with\
    \ the US and China standing out. Lately, however, the applications in Europe\n\
    have increased as well.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n6 of 26\nRegarding the different\
    \ types of crop species that can be monitored with the help of UAVs, more\nthan\
    \ 30 different species were identiﬁed. Among the most common crop species monitored\
    \ by UAV\ntechnologies are Maize, Wheat, Cotton, Vineyards, Rice and Soya. In\
    \ addition, we observe that these\ntechnologies have been used to monitor crops\
    \ with completely different characteristics, such as olive\ntrees and rice crops.\n\
    Another observation is that the monitoring of crops can take place during the\
    \ different stages\nof growth, even at the early ones before being able to draw\
    \ inferences from soil characteristics.\nThe purpose of constant and continuous\
    \ monitoring of crops at different stages of development\nis to record various\
    \ factors that may affect the ﬁnal performance of crops, as well as to evaluate\n\
    the effectiveness of actions taken to address problems identiﬁed at an earlier\
    \ stage of development.\nRegarding the size of the crops monitored we observe\
    \ in this review that it is possible:\n•\nTo monitor large ﬁelds (>10 ha), where\
    \ data are collected from all areas.\n•\nTo monitor small farms or small parts\
    \ of a ﬁeld.\n•\nTo monitor areas of great heterogeneity. This is achieved by\
    \ using a UAV equipped with automatic\npilot systems and ground-level sensors.\n\
    2.3. UAV System Technologies\nAn Unmanned Aerial System that applies to Precision\
    \ Agriculture usually includes the following\nkey elements [121]:\n•\nOne or more\
    \ UAVs: Flying vehicles that have no operator on their spindle but operate either\n\
    autonomously or remotely.\n•\nA Ground Control Station (GCS): It is a computer\
    \ that either communicates with the UAV Control\nSystem or controls and monitors\
    \ the UAV directly. The GCS monitors information related to the\nﬂight of the\
    \ UAV. The user has the ability to receive data relevant to the ﬂight of the aircraft,\
    \ but\nalso data recorded by the sensors that support the ﬂight (i.e., ground-based\
    \ sensors or sensors\nembedded in the aircraft). In addition, the GCS contains\
    \ the software required for the processing\nof data acquired by the UAV and the\
    \ extraction of the information needed by the system operator\nfor the crop monitoring.\n\
    •\nUAV Control System (UAV CS): It is used to control the UAV. It can be either\
    \ a two-way data\nlink, such as a remote control, or a built-in computer (usually\
    \ with a built in GPS). The UAV CS\nincludes the ﬂight control system and/or the\
    \ autopilot system, which controls the operation of\nthe UAV. This system receives\
    \ and processes data from the autopilot or ﬂight control system for\nthe proper\
    \ operation of the UAV. It usually contains sensors to monitor the ﬂight properties,\
    \ such\nas sensors for measuring distance from ground, air force, etc. The control\
    \ system has the ability to\nprocess information from sensors to correct any problems\
    \ that may arise, and to communicate\nwith the GCC wireless and in real time by\
    \ sending and receiving the necessary information.\n•\nSensors for data acquisition:\
    \ They are cameras intended to collect the information needed. The\nnext section\
    \ provides a detailed presentation of possible ways of collecting information\
    \ and the\ntechnologies exploited. In the case that UAVs are not intended to collect\
    \ information but are used\nfor another purpose, such as spraying, the sensors\
    \ are replaced with the necessary components.\nFocusing on the UAV technologies\
    \ being used for PA, the types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can\nbe divided into\
    \ ﬁve basic categories, based on their design characteristics (see Figure 1).\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 349\n7 of 26\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 1.\n\
    (a) Fixed-wing (eBeeTM) [23]; (b) helicopter (Hornet Maxi) [122]; (c) octocopter\
    \ [25];\n(d) blimp [123]; (e) ﬂapping-wing (SmartBird) [122]; and (f) parafoil-wing\
    \ (Tetracam) [90].\n1.\nFixed-wing: These are unmanned planes with wings that\
    \ require a runway to take off from\nthe ground or a catapult. This type of UAVs\
    \ has high endurance as well as the ability to\nﬂy at high speeds. In addition,\
    \ ﬁxed-wing UAVs have the ability to cover large areas on\neach ﬂight and can\
    \ carry more payload. However, they are more expensive than the other\ntypes.\
    \ In the works reviewed, 22% used ﬁxed-wing UAVs. One type of ﬁxed-wing UAVs that\n\
    has not been identiﬁed in the reviewed literature, but is a very promising technology,\
    \ is the\nsolar-powered UAVs [124]. Solar-powered UAVs offer signiﬁcantly increased\
    \ ﬂight times because\nthey exploit and store the sun’s energy during the day.\
    \ This is the reason that they are preferred\nfor long-endurance operations.\n\
    2.\nRotary-wing: The rotary-wing UAVS, also called rotorcrafts or Vertical Take-Off\
    \ and Landing\n(VTOL), offer the advantages of steady ﬂying at one place while\
    \ keeping the maneuverability\nattribute. These features are useful for many different\
    \ types of missions. However, they cannot\nﬂy at very high speed or stay in the\
    \ air for a long time. They are generally the most widely used\nUAVs in all kinds\
    \ of applications, but especially in Precision Agriculture. One reason for this\n\
    is the fact that they present lower cost compared to the other types of UAVs.\
    \ In addition, this\ntype of UAVs is suitable when the monitored crops are not\
    \ very large, which is usually the case.\nA UAV of this type may be:\n•\nAn unmanned\
    \ helicopter: They include main and tail rotors such as conventional helicopters.\n\
    Overall, 4% of the works used this type.\n•\nMulti-rotor: This category includes\
    \ rotary-wing UAVs with four or more rotors (quadcopter,\nhexacopter, octocopter,\
    \ etc.). These aircraft are generally more stable in ﬂight than unmanned\nhelicopters.\
    \ Overall, 72% of the works used this type.\n3.\nBlimps: This type of UAV is lighter\
    \ than air, has high endurance, ﬂies at low speeds and is\ngenerally larger in\
    \ size compared to the other types. Their manufacturing characteristics allows\n\
    them to remain in the air even in the event of a total loss of power, while being\
    \ considered\nrelatively safe in the event of a collision. Usually, they are not\
    \ used in Precision Agriculture\napplications. In the recent works reviewed, no\
    \ application was found using this type of UAVs.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    8 of 26\n4.\nFlapping wing: These UAVs are very small and they have ﬂexible, shaped\
    \ little wings inspired by\nthe way birds and insects ﬂy. They are not often used\
    \ in Precision Agriculture as they require\nhigh energy consumption due to their\
    \ size. No work was found in the literature review using\nthis type of UAVs.\n\
    5.\nParafoil-wing. Usually aircrafts of this type have one or more propellers\
    \ at the back in order to\ncontrol the course of their ﬂight, but at the same\
    \ time for harnessing the power of the air to ﬂy\nwithout consuming much energy.\
    \ They are also capable of carrying a larger payload. They are\nnot usually exploited\
    \ for PA applications. Only 2% of the works analyzed use this type.\nIn addition\
    \ to the above classiﬁcation, UAVs can also be categorized according to their\
    \ size [121].\nHowever, the categorization used in this study is more common,\
    \ as it takes into account more factors\naffecting the performance of UAVs and\
    \ their use in Precision Agriculture.\nThe majority of the recent works in Precision\
    \ Agriculture use multi-rotor UAVs. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that in most\
    \ applications the area under consideration is not very large. For this reason,\n\
    it is not necessary to use UAVs with high speed and the ability to cover large\
    \ areas in a few ﬂights, such\nas ﬁxed-wing UAVs. Thus, rotary-wing aircraft are\
    \ preferred because of the following advantages:\n•\nEasy to operate\n•\nSlower\
    \ speeds\n•\nAbility to maneuver\n•\nRelatively low cost\nThese advantages provide\
    \ greater opportunities for collecting information from crops through\nimaging,\
    \ which is the main use of UAVs in vegetation monitoring. In cases where the monitoring\
    \ area\nis relatively large, ﬁxed-wing aircraft are preferred, which enable the\
    \ monitoring of the entire area in a\nshort time.\n3. UAV Data Acquisition\nEquipped\
    \ with specialized sensors, UAVs are becoming powerful sensing systems that\n\
    complement the IoT-based techniques. The role of the sensors is to capture images\
    \ of high-spatial and\ntemporal resolution, which can assist in monitoring many\
    \ different characteristics of the vegetation.\nA variety of different types of\
    \ sensors can be used in an agricultural UAV depending on the different\ncrop\
    \ parameters that should be monitored [9]. However, the needs for low payload\
    \ capacity and the\nutilization of small platforms pose several limitations on\
    \ the selection s of the sensor(s) to be used.\nThe main criteria that the sensors\
    \ have to meet are the low weight, the low energy consumption\nand the small size.\
    \ Of course, all of the above must be combined with the ability to capture high\n\
    resolution images.\nModern commercial on-board sensors complying with the above\
    \ restrictions that are used for PA ,\nmainly belong to the following four types:\n\
    •\nVisible light sensors (RGB)\n•\nMultispectral sensors\n•\nHyperspectral sensors\n\
    •\nThermal sensors\nIn addition to the above types of sensors, other types of\
    \ sensors can be used, such as laser\nscanners, also mentioned in the literature\
    \ as light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Laser scanners\nare a well-established\
    \ technology used extensively for environmental sciences, however they are\nmostly\
    \ used for terrestrial scanning. Airborne laser scanning has been exploited since\
    \ 1994 [125], when\ncommercial systems became available. However, they were not\
    \ widely used in the studies reviewed,\nmainly due to the increased cost compared\
    \ to other types of sensors used for data acquisition [84].\nEach sensor type\
    \ can monitor different characteristics of the vegetation, such as the color and\n\
    texture of vegetation or the geometric outline of the crops. In addition, some\
    \ sensors can measure\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n9 of 26\nthe radiation in certain\
    \ wavelengths. The data acquired by these sensors can be further processed to\n\
    monitor plant biomass, vegetation health, soil moisture and other important crop\
    \ characteristics at the\ndifferent growth stages. Figure 2 presents examples\
    \ of the main types of sensors used.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 2. Examples of\
    \ sensors used by UAVs for PA: (a) thermal sensor [103]; (b) RGB sensor [59];\n\
    (c) multispectral sensor [26]; and (d) hyperspectral sensor [88].\n•\nVisible\
    \ light sensors (RGB): RGB sensors are the most frequently used sensors by UAV\
    \ systems\nfor Precision Agriculture applications. They are relatively low cost\
    \ compared to the other types\nand can acquire high resolution images. In addition,\
    \ they are easy to use and operate and they\nare lightweight. In addition, the\
    \ information acquired requires simple processing. The images\ncan be acquired\
    \ in different conditions, on both sunny and cloudy days, but a speciﬁc time frame\n\
    is required based on weather conditions to avoid inadequate or excessive exposure\
    \ of the image.\nConsidering the drawbacks of these sensors, the main disadvantage\
    \ is the fact that they are\ninadequate for analyzing a lot of vegetation parameters\
    \ that require spectral information in the\nnon-visible spectrum. They are commonly\
    \ used in tandem with the other types of sensors.\n•\nBy using multispectral or\
    \ hyperspectral imaging sensors, UAVs can acquire information about\nthe vegetation’s\
    \ spectral absorption and reﬂection on several bands. Spectral information can\n\
    be signiﬁcantly helpful in assessing a lot of biological and physical characteristics\
    \ of the crops.\nFor example, unhealthy parts of the crops can be discriminated\
    \ in an image, as visible radiation\nin the red channel is absorbed by chlorophyll,\
    \ while near infrared (NIR) radiation is strongly\nreﬂected. Thus, even if it\
    \ is not yet visible in the red channel, it can be identiﬁed by the information\n\
    in the NIR channel. Spectral information can be used to calculate several vegetation\
    \ indices and\nmonitor several crop characteristics based on them.\nMultispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral sensors are frequently used, despite their higher costs. However,\
    \ a\ndrawback of these sensors arises from the fact that it is required to apply\
    \ more complex\npre-processing methods in order to extract useful information\
    \ from the captured images.\nThe pre-processing procedure of spectral images often\
    \ contains the radiometric calibration,\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n10 of 26\n\
    geometric correction, image fusion and image enhancement. The main difference\
    \ between\nmultispectral and hyperspectral sensors is the number of bands (or\
    \ channels) that each sensor\ncan capture and the width of the bands. Multispectral\
    \ sensors capture 5–12 channels while\nhyperspectral images can usually capture\
    \ hundreds or thousands bands, but in a narrower\nbandwidth. Although in the recent\
    \ works studied multispectral sensors are used a lot more\nfrequently than hyperspectral\
    \ because of their lower cost, hyperspectral technology seems to have\na lot of\
    \ potential and is considered as the future trend for crop phenotyping research\
    \ [9].\n•\nThermal infrared sensors capture information about the temperature\
    \ of the objects and generate\nimages displaying them based on this information\
    \ and not their visible properties. Thermal\ncameras use infrared sensors and\
    \ an optical lens to receive infrared energy. All objects warmer\nthan absolute\
    \ zero (−273 ◦C/−459 ◦F) emit infrared radiation at speciﬁc wavelengths (LWIR\
    \ and\nMWIR bands) in an amount proportional to their temperature. Hence, thermal\
    \ cameras focus\nand detect the radiation in these wavelengths and usually translate\
    \ it into a grayscale image for\nthe heat representation. Many thermal imaging\
    \ sensors can also generate colored images. These\nimages often show warmer objects\
    \ as yellow and cooler objects as blue. This type of sensors\nis used for very\
    \ speciﬁc applications (e.g., irrigation management). As a result, they are not\n\
    frequently used in PA applications of UAV systems that focus on monitoring other\
    \ characteristics\nof the crops.\nIn the image acquisition by UAVs, it is typical\
    \ to acquire several overlapping images of the\ncrops. In the most cases they\
    \ capture both front and side overlapping images. This is desired as the\noverlapping\
    \ images can be used for the construction of 3D models and/or orthophotos of the\
    \ crops, as\nthe next section discusses. The rate of the overlap depends on the\
    \ type of the application. The front\noverlap usually ranges 60–95% while the\
    \ side overlap ranges 40–95% to generate three-dimensional\nmodels and 25–40%\
    \ for other uses.\nIn addition, the altitude of the UAV ﬂights varies according\
    \ to the application and spatial accuracy\nof the information we want to collect.\
    \ The distance between the target (crop) to be visualized and the\nUAV plays an\
    \ important role in determining the detail of the information acquired. This is\
    \ something\nthat depends on both the sensors and the resolution they offer. In\
    \ the majority of cases, depending on\nthe purpose of the application, the spatial\
    \ resolution of the photographs is between 0.5 cm/pixel and\n10 cm/pixel.\nQuite\
    \ often, RGB sensors are modiﬁed to acquire information about the radiation in\
    \ other bands\ntoo, usually the Near Infrared (NIR) or the Red Edge (RE) band.\
    \ This approach is observed when\nthe stakeholders want to avoid the higher costs\
    \ of buying multispectral cameras. This is achieved by\nreplacing one of the original\
    \ optical ﬁlters with one that enables the perception of near-infrared channel,\n\
    resulting often in a hybrid (e.g., NIR-RGB) sensor. The visible channel that is\
    \ no longer captured by\nthe modiﬁed RGB sensor is often captured by using another\
    \ embedded RGB sensor. The use of both\nmultispectral and visible sensors was\
    \ observed in many cases [22,23,27,31,33,49,50,55,56,61,65,69,72,\n87,103,107,113,117].\n\
    4. UAS Data Processing\nThis section focuses on the data processing techniques\
    \ utilized to analyze the UAV imagery. To be\nmore precise, we discuss the different\
    \ ways the information UAVs capture can be exploited to study\ndifferent vegetation\
    \ features. The most common features that can be monitored with UAV-based\nremote\
    \ sensing for Precision Agriculture are presented in Table 1:\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 349\n11 of 26\nTable 1. Crop features that can be monitored with UAVs.\n\
    Crop Features\nVegetation\nbiomass [22,103]\nnitrogen status [22,99,103,110]\n\

    \ use of specialized sensors, UAVs can acquire information for various features\
    \ of the\ncultivated ﬁeld. However, as mentioned above, there is still no standardized\
    \ workﬂow or well\nestablished techniques to follow for analyzing and visualizing\
    \ the information acquired. The most\ncommonly used image processing methods y\
    \ to analyze UAV imagery for Precision Agriculture\npurposes are the following:\n\
    •\nPhotogrammetry techniques: Photogrammetry regards the accurate reconstruction\
    \ of a scene or\nan object from several overlapping pictures. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques can process the 2D data\nand establish the geometric relationships\
    \ between the different images and the object(s), obtaining\n3D models. To construct\
    \ the 3D models, photogrammetry requires at least two overlapping\nimages of the\
    \ same scene and/or object(s), captured from different points of view. These kind\
    \ of\ntechniques can be used for extracting three-dimensional digital surface\
    \ or terrain models [37,40,43]\nand/or orthophotos [50,55]. UAV low-altitude data\
    \ acquisition enables the construction of 3D\nmodels with a much higher spatial\
    \ resolution compared to other remote sensing technologies\n(such as satellites).\
    \ However, the collection of many images is required to have information for\n\
    the entire ﬁeld under study. Thus, in most cases, it is necessary to collect many\
    \ overlapping\nimages to construct Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the crops\
    \ and/or create orthophotos\n(also referred to as orthomosaics). The 3D models\
    \ and the orthophotos include information about\nthe 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops based on the structure of the vegetation (e.g., the vegetation\nheight,\
    \ the canopy, the density, etc.) and can be very useful for applications that\
    \ can exploit only\nRGB imagery. The works reviewed showed that photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are very commonly\nused in all types of applications as they are\
    \ also required to create vegetation indices maps.\nIn addition, the 3D information\
    \ they include is very important and is often used in tandem with\nother techniques.\n\
    •\nMachine learning methods: Machine Learning (ML) has been used to process the\
    \ data acquired,\nfor prediction and/or identiﬁcation purposes, with great results\
    \ in many domains, such as medical\nsystems [126,127], marketing [128], biology\
    \ [129], etc. Machine learning techniques are often\nbeen applied in Precision\
    \ Agriculture to exploit the information from the large amount of data\nacquired\
    \ by the UAVs. ML is able to estimate some parameters regarding the crop growth\
    \ rate,\ndetect diseases or even to identify/discriminate objects in the images.\
    \ Machine learning usage\nhas increased a lot recently due to the fast advancements\
    \ taking place especially in the deep\nlearning ﬁeld.\n•\nVegetation Indices calculation:\
    \ Vegetation Indices (VIs) are one of the most popular products\nof remote sensing\
    \ applications for Precision Agriculture.\nThey use different mathematical\ncombinations/transformations\
    \ of at least two spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum,\ndesigned to\
    \ maximize the contribution of the vegetation characteristics while minimizing\
    \ the\nexternal confounding factors. They can deliver reliable spatial and temporal\
    \ information about the\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n12 of 26\nagricultural crops\
    \ monitored. In most cases, many VIs are extracted and used to draw conclusions.\n\
    They can be calculated based on information of either each photograph individually\
    \ or after the\nproduction of orthophotos depicting the whole crop. Calculating\
    \ vegetation indices may serve\nin the identiﬁcation of useful crop characteristics,\
    \ such as biological and physical parameters of\nthe vegetation.\nSince the processing\
    \ of data may be time consuming, several software tools and techniques have\n\
    been developed to enable faster data processing. The most commonly adopted software\
    \ solutions in\nthe works reviewed to support and accelerate the data analysis\
    \ procedure are summarized in Table 2.\nIn addition to the software tools referenced\
    \ in the table, there are several other promising software\ntools that can assist\
    \ in the data analysis process, such as Erdas Imagine [130], eCognition [131],\
    \ and\nPixelWrench 2 [132].\nTable 2. Most common software tools used in the literature\

    \ for the calculation of the vegetation indices from\nmultispectral data\nMATLAB\
    \ [35,100]\nApplied mainly for the calculation of vegetation indices. It can also\
    \ be\nexploited for other image processing methods\nPix4D [29,35,55]\nThe most\
    \ commonly used tool. It can be used for calculating VIs and/or\nconstructing\
    \ of 3D models and orthomosaics\nIn the following subsections, we provide the\
    \ details of the three most commonly used data\nprocessing techniques to analyze\
    \ data acquired from UAV ﬂights in the agricultural domain.\n4.1. Photogrammetric\
    \ Techniques\nPhotogrammetric techniques are mainly be applied for the construction\
    \ of orthomosaics and/or\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) in order to exploit\
    \ the 3D information regarding the vegetation.\nAs mentioned above, this can be\
    \ done by acquiring many overlapping images of the agricultural crops\nmonitored.\
    \ The advancements in computer vision and photogrammetric techniques have lead\
    \ to many\ndifferent techniques and algorithms that are able to match large numbers\
    \ of overlapping images and\ndetect common objects and scenes in them. The images\
    \ are processed by applying aerial triangulation\nand adjusting camera orientation.\
    \ Computer vision methods are used for matching the overlapping\nimages and the\
    \ common characteristics. To achieve object tracking as well as to identify the\
    \ scale and\nthe orientation of a particular image; in some cases, Ground Control\
    \ Points (GCPs) are being used.\nGCPs distributed in the cultivated ﬁeld can be\
    \ identiﬁed within the overlapping images: (a) to link the\nimages; and (b) to\
    \ identify the coordinates of each image and its slope. However, recent advancements\n\
    have made this redundant, as many techniques can be used without GCPs, with similar\
    \ precision.\nThe construction of the 3D Digital Elevation Models can provide\
    \ to the producer information\nabout the altitude of the earth surface, the natural\
    \ and artiﬁcial objects/structures on the surface, the\ndensity of the vegetation,\
    \ and their growth, among others. There are two types of DEMs used:\n•\nThe Digital\
    \ Terrain Model (DTM) represents the altitude of the surface of the Earth, i.e.,\
    \ of the\nterrain. These models do not take into account either artiﬁcial or natural\
    \ (e.g., trees, vegetation,\nbuildings) objects that exist in the ﬁeld. DTMs just\
    \ present the elevation of the bare Earth. Figure 3\nshows a Digital Terrain Model\
    \ from Ronchetti et al. [79].\n•\nThe Digital Surface Model (DSM) represents the\
    \ altitude of the surface that is ﬁrst encountered by\nthe remote sensing system\
    \ (i.e., when the aerial image captures the top of a building, tree, the\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n13 of 26\nvegetation etc.). Hence, the elevation model generated\
    \ includes the elevation of the bare Earth\nalong with artiﬁcial and natural objects\
    \ that may exist in the ﬁeld.\nThe DEMS constructed can be exploited either for\
    \ the extraction of 3D information directly\nor to construct orthomosaics of the\
    \ crops. An orthoimage, orthomosaic or orthophoto is an aerial\nphotograph that\
    \ is orthorectiﬁed (i.e., geometrically corrected). Thus, the scale of the constructed\n\
    image is uniform. As a result, the ﬁnal orthophoto has the same lack of distortion\
    \ as a map. In contrast\nwith a simple aerial image of a ﬁeld, an orthophoto can\
    \ be used to measure true distances as it contains\nthe 3D characteristics of\
    \ the crops.\nThe use of photogrammetry techniques have the following procedure:\
    \ create point cloud\nrepresentations of the 3D surface and either combine all\
    \ objects into a single Digital Elevation Model\nor use the DEMs to generate an\
    \ orthophoto. The most commonly used set of algorithms for this\npurpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [133]. The main advantage of SfM is that it does not require\n\
    any information regarding the camera parameters or the environmental settings.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\nFigure 3. (a) A Digital Terrain Model [79]; and (b) a Digital Surface\
    \ Model [109].\nPhotogrammetric techniques are commonly used in all types of applications\
    \ as they are also\nrequired for constructing the vegetation indices maps. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are used in the\nmajority of recent works (93%) to exploit and extract\
    \ information regarding the 3D characteristics of\nthe crops. However, photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are in most cases used to compliment other types of\ndata processing\
    \ methods.\n4.2. Using Machine Learning\nMachine Learning (ML) and Data Mining\
    \ methods are widely used in PA to exploit the\ninformation acquired by the UAVs.\
    \ Taking into account the large amounts of data collected from\nagricultural ﬁelds,\
    \ machine learning can be applied to enhance the performance of UAV-based systems\n\
    for PA, by extracting knowledge for several parameters of the vegetation. ML is\
    \ used in many cases\nand for different purposes. Both unsupervised and supervised\
    \ learning techniques are being exploited,\nvia clustering, classiﬁcation and\
    \ regression methods.\nRegression methods are widely used in UAV applications\
    \ for PA for a variety of purposes.\nRegression has been used to estimate spectral\
    \ vegetation indices by analyzing data acquired from RGB\nimages [35], presenting\
    \ generally good results. Additionally, regression has been used to examine the\n\
    correlation of some vegetation indices with vegetation features such as nitrogen\
    \ [22,38,99], leaf are\nindex [36,103], and biomass [22,36,103]. For this purpose,\
    \ both linear (simple and multiple) regression\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n14\
    \ of 26\nand nonlinear regression methods have been used. In a comparison of different\
    \ regression algorithms,\nfor estimating leaf nitrogen content, Random Forests\
    \ presents the best results among 14 algorithms,\nwith the coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ (R2) being up to 0.79 [38]. Regression methods are also used\nto predict crop\
    \ water status, by using information derived from RGB, multispectral and thermal\n\
    sensors [64,92,104]. In this context, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks present generally\
    \ good results (R2 up\nto 0.87 by using and information from some spectral bands).\n\
    Classiﬁcation methods are also very commonly used for weed mapping [18,33,44,73,106,111]\
    \ and\ndisease detection [46,77,97]. The most popular and precise classiﬁcation\
    \ techniques are the Artiﬁcial\nNeural Networks (ANNs) family [18,44,73,104] and\
    \ the Random Forest algorithm [22,38,49]. These\nalgorithms directly use the RGB\
    \ colors, the intensity, spectral information or other features derived\nfrom\
    \ the image acquired. In some cases, data about the neighborhood of each pixel\
    \ are also considered.\nApart from the above data, classiﬁcation algorithms can\
    \ also use vegetation indices as features in\nthe model to achieve higher accuracy.\
    \ In general, ANNs present higher accuracy, compared to other\nclassiﬁcation algorithms,\
    \ that reaches up to 99% for weed mapping in some cases [98]. The accuracy\nof\
    \ the method depends on the type of the crops monitored [73] as expected. Convolutional\
    \ Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), is among the most used family of algorithms. CNNs belong\
    \ to deep learning\nalgorithms that have been proved to be very effective in object\
    \ detection in large datasets.\nThe use of Deep Learning (DL) in Precision Agriculture\
    \ applications is a recent, modern and\npromising technique, having increasing\
    \ popularity. Deep learning techniques extend typical ML by\nadding more complexity\
    \ into the derived models. DL techniques transform the data using various\nfunctions\
    \ that allow data representation in a hierarchical way, through several levels\
    \ of abstraction.\nAdvancements and applications of Deep Learning into other domains\
    \ indicate its large potential.\nAs indicated in [16,134], the use of Machine\
    \ Learning and more particular Deep Learning will be even\nmore widespread in\
    \ the next years.\nA very common application of Machine Learning methods in PA\
    \ is Object Based Image Analysis\n(OBIA). The purpose of OBIA is to discriminate\
    \ objects within agricultural images obtained from\nUAVs [32,43].\nIn contrast\
    \ to traditional pixel-based image classiﬁcation, which classiﬁes each\npixel,\
    \ OBIA groups small pixels together into vector objects. With the higher spatial\
    \ resolution\nof UAV imagery, pixel-based classiﬁcations have become much less\
    \ effective.\nThat is due to\nthe fact that the relationship between the pixel\
    \ size and the object size has changed signiﬁcantly.\nTherefore, object-oriented\
    \ classiﬁcation methods are increasing in popularity. They use segmentation\n\
    methods to divide the image pixels into homogeneous segments/groups. Then, these\
    \ segments/objects\nare arranged into classes based on their geometric, spectral,\
    \ textural and other characteristics.\nOBIA is usually composed of two main steps:\n\
    1.\nImage segmentation\n2.\nFeature extraction and classiﬁcation\nThese methods\
    \ are exploited to recognize and detect weeds or discriminate different species\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld. A detailed review of algorithms and challenges for OBIA, from\
    \ a remote sensing perspective,\nwas reported by Hossain and Chen [135].\n4.3.\
    \ Vegetation Indices\nVegetation Indices (VIs) have been widely used in remote\
    \ sensing applications for Precision\nAgriculture. They are considered to be very\
    \ effective for monitoring the growth and health of crops\nin qualitative and\
    \ quantitative vegetation analysis [25,29,30]. Vegetation Indices are based on\
    \ the\nabsorption of electromagnetic radiation by the vegetation.\nThey are mathematical\
    \ transformations of the absorption and scattering in different bands of\nthe\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. The reﬂectance in several bands is affected by parameters\
    \ such as\nvegetation biochemical and physical properties, environmental effects,\
    \ soil background properties,\nmoisture content, etc. The understanding of the\
    \ spectral behavior of the vegetation is fundamental\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    15 of 26\nto remote sensing applications to monitor various vegetation features\
    \ (e.g., biomass [22], nitrogen\nstatus [19,22], vegetation health [46], etc.)\
    \ It has been shown that certain VIs are signiﬁcantly related\nwith different\
    \ parameters of the vegetation.\nSimple Vegetation Indices that can combine RGB\
    \ information and some spectral bands such as\nNIR and RE have signiﬁcantly improved\
    \ the ability to detect green and healthy vegetation. Several VIs\nhave been developed,\
    \ as different environments have their own complex characteristics, which needs\n\
    to be taken into account when using a Vegetation Index. Thus, each VI has its\
    \ own speciﬁc combination\nof the reﬂectance in different bands, in order to detect\
    \ vegetation. Hence, its VI is suitable for speciﬁc\nuses. The main concept is\
    \ to combine the reﬂections of different bands to decrease the “noise” from\n\
    external factors (e.g., sensors calibration, lighting, atmosphere, soil properties,\
    \ etc.). For example, as\nmentioned in the previous section, visible radiation\
    \ to the red is absorbed by the chlorophyll while the\nradiation in the NIR band\
    \ is strongly reﬂected. In this way, vegetation can be discriminated by the soil\n\
    in an image. In way, unhealthy vegetation can also be detected.\nVegetation Indices\
    \ that are based on the radiation in the Red and NIR channels, such as the RVI\n\
    or the NDVI index, are designed to increase the contrast between the vegetation\
    \ and the soil. The\nrelationship between the reﬂections of the two zones allows\
    \ the elimination of disturbances by factors\nthat affect the radiation of each\
    \ zone in the same way.\nThe effort to model the biophysical parameters of vegetation\
    \ has led to the creation of several\ndifferent vegetation indices [136–139].\
    \ The vegetation indices can be divided into two main categories:\n1.\nVegetation\
    \ Indices based on multispectral or hyperspectral data. Most of the developed\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices use multispectral and/or hyperspectral information that\
    \ can combine several bands.\n2.\nVegetation Indices based on information from\
    \ the visible spectrum. Several VIs in the visible\nspectrum have been developed\
    \ and are widely used due to the high cost of multispectral and\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensors.\nA list of the most used vegetation indices is presented in Table 3.\
    \ For the interpretation of\nthe following formulas, the following abbreviations\
    \ represent the reﬂection in the respective color\nor spectrum:\n•\nR: Red (620–670\
    \ nm)\n•\nG: Green (500–560 nm)\n•\nB: Blue (430–500 nm)\n•\nNIR: Near Infrared\
    \ (720–1500 nm)\n•\nRE: Red Edge (670–720 nm)\nConcerning the multispectral vegetation\
    \ indices, one of the ﬁrst well-known indices was Ratio\nVegetation Index (RVI).\
    \ This index enhances the contrast among vegetation and soil. However, it is\n\
    sensitive to the optical properties of ground. The best known and most widely\
    \ used vegetation index\nis the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\
    \ which is the evolution of RVI and is calculated\nby the visible and near infrared\
    \ light reﬂected from the vegetation. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation\nreﬂects\
    \ more visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\
    \ growth and health\nof many agricultural crops. It is based on absorption in\
    \ Red due to chlorophyll and reﬂectance in NIR.\nRVI and NDVI are calculated as\
    \ shown in Table 3.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n16 of 26\nTable 3. Most used vegetation\
    \ indices.\nVegetation Index\nAbbreviation\nFormula\nVegetation Indices derived\

    \ Index\nExG\n2 ∗ G − R − B\nNormalized Difference Index\nNDI\nG − R\nG + R\n\
    Several other VIs have been developed based on NDVI. NDRE uses the method of NDVI\
    \ to\nnormalize the ratio of NIR radiation with Red Edge (RE) radiation. The same\
    \ applies for GNDVI with\nNIR and Green (G) bands.\nFigure 4 shows examples of\
    \ crop maps constructed from information of spectral VIs (NDVI and\nNDRE) in different\
    \ growth stages. We can see that the difference in the maps while the vegetation\n\
    grows is quite clear.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.\nVegetation indices maps of crops in\
    \ different growth stages [29]:\n(a) NDVI maps;\nand (b) NDRE maps\nFocusing on\
    \ the VIs extracted from RGB images, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) and Normalized\n\
    Difference Index (NDI) are the most used indices. ExG is based on the assumption\
    \ that plants display\na clear high degree of greenness, and soil is the only\
    \ background element. Thus, it is calculated\nby doubling the radiation in the\
    \ Green channel minus the radiation in Red and Blue channels.\nNDI was proposed\
    \ to separate plants from soil and residue background images, using only green\
    \ and\nred channels.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n17 of 26\nAlthough the VIs that\
    \ use information in the visible light can be useful for crop monitoring,\nthey\
    \ cannot provide information for several parameters of the vegetation and also\
    \ they are sensitive\nto working environment properties such as the atmosphere,\
    \ lighting, etc. Hyperspectral remote\nsensing is expected to be the future trend\
    \ in crop monitoring and this is mainly because it allows the\ndevelopment of\
    \ new bands combination of vegetation indices. In many cases, it has been proved\
    \ that\nhyperspectral vegetation indices are less sensitive to saturation, change\
    \ in viewing/lighting geometry,\nand atmospheric contamination. The combination\
    \ of new bands can eliminate noise from the working\nenvironment and in the same\
    \ time exploit the information of certain bands and extract information for\n\
    more biophysical features of the vegetation.\n5. Limitations in the Use of UAVs\
    \ for Precision Agriculture\nAlthough the use of UAVs for PA is expanding there\
    \ are several limitations that prevent their\nwider use. The absence of a standardized\
    \ workﬂow leads to the adoption of ad-hoc procedures for\ndeploying PA applications,\
    \ a fact that discourages the relevant stakeholders. In addition, as PA requires\n\
    data-intensive procedures for the exploitation of the images acquired, skilled\
    \ and expert personnel\nis usually needed. This means that an average farmer may\
    \ need training or even been forced to hire\nexperts to assist with the image\
    \ processing, which may be costly. This fact may prohibit the adoption\nof UAV\
    \ technologies from individual farmers with only a few and small agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds.\nThe high investment cost to purchase the Unmanned Aerial System is another\
    \ prohibitive factor.\nProducers with larger cultivated areas and higher proﬁt\
    \ rates are able to use more sophisticated,\nhigh-cost systems, though this is\
    \ not the case for the majority of the ﬁelds in Europe. There were\n10.5 million\
    \ agricultural holdings in the EU in 2016, two-thirds of which were less than\
    \ 5 hectares in\nsize, as shown in the Eurostat survey [140].\nAnother drawback\
    \ stems from UAV technology limitations. Most commercial UAVs have a short\nﬂight\
    \ time, ranging from 20 min to 1 h, covering a very restricted area at every ﬂight.\
    \ UAVs that can\noffer longer ﬂight time are relatively expensive. In addition,\
    \ the effective use of UAVs is prone to\nclimatic conditions. For example, on\
    \ a very windy or rainy day, the ﬂight should be postponed.\nAs the use of UAVs\
    \ for agriculture purposes is considered to be commercial, UAV ﬂights should\n\
    also adhere to the related legislation and national rules. However, the EU regulations\
    \ [141,142] for the\nuse of UAVs will replace national rules from July 2020. In\
    \ practice, these regulations report that, once\nan UAV pilot has received the\
    \ appropriate authorization, he/she will be allowed to freely use UAVs in\nthe\
    \ EU. The EU legislation will cover all types of possible UAVs operations, fostering\
    \ the development\nof innovative applications (e.g., for PA).\nThe EU regulations\
    \ consider three categories of operations:\n1.\nOpen category: Operations in this\
    \ category do not require authorization or pilot license.\nThis category is limited\
    \ to operations: in visual line of sight (VLOS), up to 120 m ﬂight height and\n\
    performed with UAVs compliant with some technical requirements deﬁned.\n2.\nSpeciﬁc\
    \ category: This is the second level of operations, which covers operations that\
    \ are not\ncompliant to the restrictions of the open category and are considered\
    \ “medium risk” operations.\nOperators must perform a risk assessment (using a\
    \ standardized method) and deﬁne mitigation\nmeasures. Operations involving UAVs\
    \ of more than 25 kg or not operated in VLOS will typically\nfall under this category.\
    \ The technical requirements for this category depend on the speciﬁc\nauthorized\
    \ operation.\n3.\nCertiﬁed category: This category is considered high risk and\
    \ includes operations involving large\ndrones in controlled air-spaces. Rules\
    \ applicable to this category will be the same as for manned\naviation. This category\
    \ does not concern the use of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\nTaking into account\
    \ the rapid developments in UAV technology and the sensors use in PA,\nthe cost\
    \ of the Unmanned Aerial Systems will be reduced in the near future. Practical\
    \ limitations,\nsuch as the short ﬂight time, are also expected to be solved by\
    \ the advancements in technology.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n18 of 26\nThese\
    \ improvements will ensure that farmers can reap more from the use of UAVs for\
    \ remote sensing\nin Precision Agriculture.\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn\
    \ this work, we review 100 recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\
    \ We present the\nmost frequent applications, the UAV types used and the Unmanned\
    \ Aerial systems architecture for\nPA. Then, we focus on the most used sensors\
    \ for monitoring the crops and the processing methods\nexploiting UAV imagery.\
    \ We show that UAVs can have several applications, however monitoring crop\ngrowth\
    \ is the one that stands out. The following three main processing techniques stand\
    \ out in the\nliterature for exploiting the information acquired:\n1.\nPhotogrammetry\
    \ techniques are used to construct Orthophotos or DEMs from the overlapping\n\
    images acquired. They are used in most of the applications to create vegetation\
    \ maps considering\nseveral characteristics; however, they are also used standalone\
    \ mainly when only RGB sensors\nare available, to exploit the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the vegetation.\n2.\nMachine Learning methods can be used to monitor several\
    \ different characteristics of the crops.\nThey can exploit RGB and/or multispectral/hyperspectral\
    \ images. A very frequent technique\nexploited in the literature is the Object\
    \ Based Image Analysis.\n3.\nVegetation Indices use combinations of the reﬂection\
    \ of several bands obtained by RGB or spectral\nsensors. They are proved to be\
    \ most effective when multispectral or hyperspectral information is\nused. They\
    \ have been used in many recent studies. They have been proved to be very effective\
    \ in\nmonitoring various parameters of the crops, by using different combinations\
    \ of spectral bands.\nIn Figure 5, we present some statistics for the use of sensors\
    \ and processing methods for the\ndifferent applications.\nFigure 5. The use of\
    \ sensors and processing techniques in the different UAVs applications.\nWe can\
    \ observe that there is no standardized workﬂow in most cases and different techniques\n\
    are used to exploit UAV-acquired information for the same type of application.\
    \ For example, looking\nat the sensors and techniques used for monitoring the\
    \ health of the crops, we can see that it is\nrelatively premature. Disease detection\
    \ is mainly applied through temporal analysis of the vegetation’s\ngrowth. However,\
    \ multispectral and hyperspectral sensors seem to have great potential in this\n\
    context. An approach using multispectral sensing technologies could reliably deliver\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, discriminating healthy and unhealthy portions of the vegetation.\
    \ In such an approach, the\nfarmer could locate the “weak” corps ﬁeld areas and\
    \ take timely decisions to save the parts of the crop\nproduction that seem unhealthy.\n\
    On the contrary, considering weed mapping, we can see that some studies use machine\
    \ learning\ntechniques to detect weeds, mainly OBIA, while others use the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the crops though\nDEMs, VIs or other processing methods. Weed detection with\
    \ UAVs based on object-based image\nanalysis seems to be at an advanced stage\
    \ and can be used for site-speciﬁc weed management. We can\nsee that machine learning\
    \ techniques are exploited in 62.50% of the applications that used RGB sensors\n\
    and in all the applications with multispectral sensors.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 349\n19 of 26\nFocusing on UAV-based growth monitoring, many different methods\
    \ are really promising but it\nseems that their integration in a standardized\
    \ workﬂow can improve its applicability and efﬁciency.\nGrowth monitoring and\
    \ yield prediction is most commonly performed with the use of RGB (30%)\nand multispectral\
    \ (59%) sensors. The information acquired is exploited for estimating the density\
    \ of\nproduction and the biomass. The ﬁndings of this review appoint that combining\
    \ information coming\nfrom Vegetation Indices with the 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops coming from RGB images can improve\nthe accuracy of growth and yield estimation\
    \ methods.\nIn contrast with the above, the use of UAV systems for irrigation\
    \ management is closer to\na standard workﬂow, which involves the use of thermal\
    \ and/or multispectral sensors to monitor the\nneeds of water of different parts\
    \ of the crops. Equipped with thermal sensors, the Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles are\
    \ able to detect possible deﬁciencies in the irrigation of different sites. This\
    \ information\ncan be processed through photogrammetry techniques into a single\
    \ high-resolution vegetation map,\nhighlighting the stressed areas. A map in this\
    \ context can be constructed though the use of some VIs\nwhen multispectral imagery\
    \ is used. Thus, a map such as this can support the producers to apply\nVariable\
    \ Rate Irrigation (VRI) applications.\nFunding: This research was co-funded by\

  title: A Review on UAV-Based Applications for Precision Agriculture
  verbatim_quote1: 'Information

    Review

    * Remote sensing is generally considered one of the most important technologies
    for Precision

    Agriculture and Smart Farming. It is commonly used for monitoring cultivated ﬁelds,
    providing

    effective solutions for Precision Agriculture in the last 35 years [3]. Remote
    sensing can monitor many

    crop and vegetation parameters through images at various wavelengths.'

    Review

    * The development of UAV-based remote sensing systems have taken remote sensing
    and Precision

    Agriculture one step further. The use of UAVs to monitor crops offers great possibilities
    to acquire

    field data in an easy, fast and cost-effective way compared to previous methods.
    UAV-based

    monitoring systems have high temporal resolution as they can be used at the user’s
    will. This enhances

    the ﬂexibility of the image acquisition process. In addition, UAVs are a lot simpler
    to use and also

    cheaper than manned aircrafts. Moreover, they are more efﬁcient than the ground
    systems as they can

    cover a large ﬁeld in a short amount of time and in a non-destructive way, which
    is very important.'

  analysis: 'The paper highlights the adaptability of the SWAMP platform, allowing
    for deployment in multiple hardware and software configurations. The authors demonstrate
    this in four different pilot studies, each with unique conditions, illustrating
    the platform''s versatility. The performance analysis is unique to the specific
    implementation of the FIWARE components chosen for this project and provides valuable
    insights into potential bottlenecks in the system. The findings from the performance
    analysis will help optimize the SWAMP platform for practical applications in smart
    water management and beyond. The paper makes notable contributions to the literature
    on IoT-based precision irrigation systems and the limitations of the current FIWARE
    implementation.


    The findings suggest that the scalability of the SWAMP platform is primarily limited
    by the performance of the MongoDB database. By optimizing MongoDB''s performance
    or implementing alternative data storage solutions, the platform''s scalability
    can be significantly improved. It is important to note that the performance analysis
    is specific to the FIWARE implementation of the SWAMP platform. Other IoT platforms
    may exhibit different performance characteristics.'

    \ The smart management of freshwater for precision irrigation in agriculture is\
    \ essential\nfor increasing crop yield and decreasing costs, while contributing\
    \ to environmental sustainability.\nThe intense use of technologies offers a means\
    \ for providing the exact amount of water needed by\nplants. The Internet of Things\

    1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world,\
    \ amounting to up to 70% of the\ntotal use [1], which makes the case for smart\
    \ water management in order to guarantee water and food\nsecurity to the world’s\
    \ population. Irrigation systems and ﬁeld application methods for the cultivation\n\
    of crops play an important role therein. In an attempt to avoid loss of productivity\
    \ caused by water\nSensors 2019, 19, 276; doi:10.3390/s19020276\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 276\n2 of 20\nstress (under-irrigation), farmers spray more\
    \ water than needed (over-irrigation) and as a result not\nonly productivity is\
    \ challenged but also water and energy are wasted. Precision irrigation, in its\
    \ turn,\ncan use water more efﬁciently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation\
    \ and over-irrigation.\nThe smart management of water for precision irrigation\
    \ in agriculture is essential for increasing crop\nyield and decreasing costs,\
    \ while at the same time contributing to the environmental sustainability.\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [2] emerges as the natural choice for smart water management\n\
    applications, even though the integration of different technologies required for\
    \ making it work\nseamlessly in practice is still not fully accomplished. The\
    \ emergence of IoT is a phenomenon that owes\nto the conjunction of several factors\
    \ such as inexpensive devices, low-power wireless technologies,\navailability\
    \ of cloud data centers for storage and processing, management frameworks for\
    \ dealing\nwith unstructured data from social networks, high-performance computing\
    \ resources in commodity\nplatforms, and computational intelligence algorithms\
    \ to deal with this monumental amount of data\n(aka big data analytics).\nCurrently,\
    \ there are some challenges to be overcome that still prevent the widespread use\
    \ of\nIoT for precision irrigation. Firstly, software development for IoT-based\
    \ smart applications, such as\nirrigation for agriculture, is not yet fully automatized\
    \ [3]. Secondly, advanced IoT software platforms\nare still missing, for automating\
    \ part of the process and integrating different technologies such as IoT,\nbig\
    \ data analytics, cloud computing and fog computing, for the deployment of pilot\
    \ applications for\nsmart water management. Thirdly, the integration of heterogeneous\
    \ and advanced sensors requires\nadequate standards and information models.\n\
    The SWAMP project developed and assessed an IoT-based smart water management platform\n\
    for precision irrigation in agriculture with a hands-on approach based on four\
    \ pilots in Brazil, Italy\nand Spain [4]. The SWAMP Platform can be conﬁgured\
    \ and deployed in different ways thus making\nup different SWAMP Systems, customized\
    \ to deal with the requirements and constraints of different\nsettings, countries,\
    \ climate, soils, and crops, which requires a good deal of ﬂexibility to adapt\
    \ to a\nrange of deployment conﬁgurations involving a varied mix of technologies.\n\
    This paper presents the SWAMP project, its architecture, platform and pilots,\
    \ as well as a\nscenario-based development process of derived systems. The SWAMP\
    \ layered architecture considers\nthree categories of services to ensure its replication\
    \ and adaptability. Entirely replicable services\ndeal with IoT services, storage\
    \ services, and data analytics and machine learning. Fully customizable\nservices\
    \ deal with water data management issues that specialize generic analytic services\
    \ into particular\ntechniques for different types of irrigation and water distribution.\
    \ Finally, application speciﬁc services\nrequire higher development effort since\
    \ they serve particular farms.\nThe SWAMP Platform contains the mainstream components\
    \ of FIWARE [5] and semantic features\nprovided by a SPARQL-based context engine\
    \ [6]. The platform may be deployed in a range of\ndifferent conﬁgurations for\
    \ component placement in the cloud or in the fog, involving the use of IoT\ncommunication\
    \ technologies and smart algorithms and analytics in the cloud, and fog-based\
    \ smart\ndecisions located on the farm premises. This is aimed at experimenting\
    \ with different deployment\npossibilities of the SWAMP Platform and providing\
    \ additional insights in terms of the replicability\nand adaptability of its components\
    \ to different settings. In other words, experimenting different\ndeployment conﬁgurations\
    \ is an important step for speeding up the learning process on how to deal\nwith\
    \ such a platform.\nAs scalability is a major concern for IoT applications, a\
    \ performance analysis of key software\ncomponents of its FIWARE-powered platform\
    \ was conducted, personalized for each pilot scenario.\nThe results show that\
    \ this platform can deal with the requirements of the pilots, but scalability\
    \ comes\nat a price. It was found that some FIWARE components must be ﬁne-tuned\
    \ to provide improved\nperformance and other ones must be completely re-engineered\
    \ to provide higher scalability using less\ncomputational resources. In addition,\
    \ MongoDB was identiﬁed as the bottleneck of the FIWARE tested\ninstallation that\
    \ may cause system crashes.\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n3 of 20\nThe contributions\
    \ of this paper are threefold. Firstly, the SWAMP approach that is the result\
    \ of\na collaborative interdisciplinary project involving researchers and practitioners\
    \ in two continents is\nintroduced. Secondly, different system deployments for\
    \ the SWAMP Platform are presented. Thirdly,\nthe results of a performance analysis\
    \ study that reveals important ﬁndings for the scalability of SWAMP\nIoT Platform\
    \ based on FIWARE are shown.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section 2 introduces\
    \ background and related work. Section 3\nintroduces SWAMP concepts, while Section\
    \ 4 presents the four pilots and Section 5 details the system\ndeployment scenarios\
    \ for the SWAMP Platform. Section 6 presents performance analysis results\nfocusing\
    \ on scalability of the SWAMP Platform. Section 7 discusses the key ﬁndings and\
    \ results and\nﬁnally Section 8 draws conclusions and future work.\n2. Background\
    \ and Related Work\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no open IoT-based Platform\
    \ speciﬁcally focused on precision\nirrigation for agriculture, so that a clear\
    \ comparison with SWAMP is not possible. On the other\nhand, IoT has many security\
    \ requirements, such as privacy, conﬁdentiality, integrity, authentication,\n\
    authorization and accounting [7], as well as the signiﬁcant challenges posed by\
    \ security threats to the\nsuccess of IoT platforms [8]. However, this is out\
    \ of the scope of this paper.\n2.1. IoT Systems for Precision Irrigation\nCurrent\
    \ open source IoT-based systems for precision irrigation are mostly theoretical\
    \ with limited\nproof of concept experiences. They are either too generic or too\
    \ speciﬁc and do not explicitly address\neasy system deployment for facilitating\
    \ replicability and streamlining the deployment of new systems.\nWhen it comes\
    \ to providing advanced features to water management, there are some isolated\
    \ initiatives\nnot necessarily connected to the existing platforms and architectures.\
    \ For example, the FIGARO project\naims at increasing water productivity and improving\
    \ irrigation practices through the development\nof a precision irrigation management\
    \ platform, but not directly involving IoT [9]. Also, Popovi´c\net al. [10] present\
    \ a case study of a specially designed and currently limited IoT-enabled platform\n\
    for collecting data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains.\
    \ Agri-IoT [11] is a\ntheoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and real-time\
    \ processing for smart farming that\nshares some similarities with SWAMP.\nIn\
    \ the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for IoT combined\
    \ with cloud-based\nservices and big data analytics. In Europe, there is a current\
    \ concern to understand the challenges\nand compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale\
    \ pilots for smart agriculture. Brewster et al. discuss the\ndeployment of those\
    \ large-scale pilots for IoT in agriculture and describe technologies and solutions\n\
    that might be present in some agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops\
    \ and meat & vegetable\nsupply chain [12].\nFIWARE has been used as a computing\
    \ platform for many IoT-based applications for smart\nfarming.\nRodriguez et al.\
    \ [13] compiled a short literature review and presented the Agricolus\nplatform\
    \ for precision farming. López-Riquelme et al. presented an implementation of\
    \ FIWARE\nfor a speciﬁc scenario of precision irrigation in agriculture in the\
    \ south of Spain [14], however, it is\nfocused on a speciﬁc use case, providing\
    \ details of devices and equipment, as well as irrigation\ntechniques. In contrast,\
    \ this paper presents an architecture and a platform based on FIWARE, as well\n\
    as conﬁgurations for system deployments in four scenarios.\nFog computing is a\
    \ fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing with challenges related to the huge\namount\
    \ of data that will be generated with the increasing utilization of IoT-based\
    \ systems [15].\nA new technological trend to implement the fog is container-based\
    \ virtualization, which provides a\nlightweight alternative to traditional hypervisors\
    \ [16]. FIWARE Generic Enablers are also distributed\nas Docker containers in\
    \ order to be used in the SWAMP fog computing approach.\nFogFlow\nprovides a programming\
    \ model for IoT-based applications for smart cities distributed over the cloud\n\
    and the fog located in the network edge [17]. Even though FogFlow is integrated\
    \ into FIWARE,\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n4 of 20\nthe SWAMP project takes a clean\
    \ approach and uses directly the components provided by FIWARE,\nin combination\
    \ with new components developed speciﬁcally for the SWAMP precision agriculture\n\
    scenarios whenever needed.\n2.2. The FIWARE Platform\nFIWARE [5] has been attracting\
    \ general attention for being an open source EU-funded solution,\ncomprised of\
    \ a series of software components called Generic Enablers (GE) that perform functions\n\
    needed in IoT-based smart applications. GEs can be used to build different applications\
    \ that exchange\ninformation through a REST API following the OMA NGSI [18] standard\
    \ based on JSON. The central\naspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information\
    \ model is the concept of entities and\ntheir attributes. There has been an ongoing\
    \ effort to develop a Context Information Management API\nbased on recent advances\
    \ in Linked Data (LD) [19] based on JSON-LD called NGSI-LD, deﬁned in\nRDF (Resource\
    \ Description Framework) [20]. Both NGSI and NGSI-LD are currently supported by\n\
    FIWARE, even though the NGSI-LD speciﬁcation is preliminary [21].\nSome FIWARE\
    \ GEs are considered key enablers, such as:\n•\nOrion: A publish/subscribe context\
    \ broker, considered the heart of FIWARE. Orion only stores\nthe latest version\
    \ of entity attributes and it needs to work together with other applications in\n\
    order to maintain historical data.\n•\nIoT Agent: Maps data coming from sensors\
    \ and going to actuators to the FIWARE NGSI information\nmodel to be stored in\
    \ Orion and further processed by other GEs or external applications.\n•\nQuantum\
    \ Leap: New GE that preserves Orion NGSI historical entity data as times series,\
    \ replacing\nthe old and less scalable STH Comet.\n•\nCygnus: A data processing\
    \ and distribution system for applications that require more elaborate\ndata ﬂow\
    \ management than simple historical data.\n•\nCosmos: A set of tools that interface\
    \ with popular Big Data Platforms.\nIt has been shown that different architectural\
    \ choices of IoT platforms affect system scalability\nand that automatic real-time\
    \ decision-making is feasible in an environment composed of dozens\nof thousands\
    \ of sensors continuously transmitting data [22]. Cruz et al. present a comprehensive\n\
    study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates the performance\
    \ of various\nIoT platforms [23]. They did not focus on speciﬁc features of FIWARE\
    \ and did not evaluate different\nscenarios and infrastructures, such as fog computing.\
    \ Martínez et al. [24] give a detailed description\nof the architecture of a testbed\
    \ of the FIWARE platform conﬁgured for the precision agriculture\ndomain. It differs\
    \ from our approach because their test application connects directly to FIWARE\
    \ using\nNGSI JSON interface, while this paper uses an IoT Agent for MQTT and\
    \ an IoT sensor simulator for\ngenerating synthetic data.\nA preliminary performance\
    \ analysis of FIWARE for SWAMP revealed that fog computing does\nnot always improve\
    \ the overall system performance and can even make it worse [25]. This paper\n\
    differs from previous work as it evaluates different conﬁgurations of FIWARE and\
    \ its focus is on the\nscenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture deﬁned for\
    \ the SWAMP project.\n2.3. The SEPA Platform\nThe SPARQL Event Processing Architecture\
    \ (SEPA) [6] enables the detection and communication\nof data changes for the\
    \ Semantic Web of Things [26]. SEPA is based upon W3C SPARQL 1.1 [27],\na RDF\
    \ query language, where publishers and subscribers exchange data. The SEPA framework\n\
    offers developers a solution for implementing Dynamic Linked Data applications\
    \ and services.\nLinked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing\
    \ and connecting structured data on\nthe Web [18]. Dynamic aspects of Linked Data\
    \ involve discovery, granularity level, description\nof changes, detection algorithms,\
    \ and notiﬁcation mechanisms. The SEPA broker is the core element\nof the architecture,\
    \ implementing a content-based publish-subscribe mechanism where publishers\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 276\n5 of 20\nuse SPARQL 1.1 Updates to generate events and\
    \ subscribers use SPARQL 1.1 Queries to subscribe to\nevents. The latter receives\
    \ SPARQL query results and subsequent notiﬁcations generated by changes\nin the\
    \ RDF knowledge base are expressed in terms of added and removed query results\
    \ since the\nprevious notiﬁcation.\n3. SWAMP: Concept and Overview\nThe SWAMP\
    \ project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation system concept for agriculture.\n\
    Within SWAMP, water management for agriculture is partitioned into three phases:\
    \ water reserve,\nwater distribution and water consumption. For Water Consumption\
    \ SWAMP provides real-time\nresponses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions\
    \ change. On the other hand, changes in water\ndistribution are performed in a\
    \ longer timescale. Distribution and Consumption management systems\nare integrated,\
    \ as water usage triggers water distribution. The management of water reserves\
    \ is\nnot considered.\nThe SWAMP Architecture is divided into ﬁve layers, as depicted\
    \ by Figure 1.\nSensors 2019, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n6 of 21 \n \nFigure 1. SWAMP\
    \ Layered Architecture. \nDifferent layers of the architecture are comprised of\
    \ more generic components that are more \nprone to be ported to other settings,\
    \ whereas others are more application-specific and thus porting \nrequires new\
    \ development efforts. When it comes to the generality/specificity scale, the\
    \ SWAMP \narchitecture provides three categories of components: (a) Fully Replicable\
    \ Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 \nof the architecture are generic enough to allow\
    \ them to be replicable in different settings; (b) Fully \nCustomizable Services:\
    \ Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and therefore\
    \ \nmust be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques\
    \ and models of water \ndistribution and irrigation, which may require customization\
    \ for every new deployment; (c) \nApplication Specific Services: Services in Layer\
    \ 5 address particularities of pilots. \n4. SWAMP Pilots \n4.1. MATOPIBA Pilot\
    \ (Luís Eduardo Magalhães—Brazil) \nThe MATOPIBA region encompasses the Brazilian\
    \ states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), \nPiauí (PI) and Bahia (BA), and is\
    \ one of the most critical irrigated agriculture frontiers in the country, \n\
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Typical crops are soybeans,\
    \ corn and cotton \nwhere irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. Figure\
    \ 2 depicts the map of Northeastern \nBrazil showing the precise location of the\
    \ pilot in the municipality of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (a), \nFigure 1. SWAMP Layered\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nLayer 1: Device & Communication: a variety of sensor and actuator\
    \ technologies to acquire soil\n(e.g., moisture), plant (e.g., growing stage)\
    \ and weather (e.g., air temperature), as well as LPWAN\ncommunication technologies\
    \ (e.g., LoRaWAN [28]) are abstracted in this layer. The SWAMP pilots\nuse commercial\
    \ sensors as well as a homemade multiparametric sensor probe. Also, commercial\n\
    drones have been used to take images but a speciﬁc drone is under development\
    \ since one of\nthe partners is a drone maker. A complete description of the sensing\
    \ infrastructure is outside the\nscope of this paper.\n•\nLayer 2: Data Acquisition,\
    \ Security & Management: protocols and software components for\ndata acquisition\
    \ (e.g., MQTT [29] and LoRa Server [30]) are the key characteristic of this layer,\n\
    in addition to security and device management functions. The FIWARE IoT Agent\
    \ GE also belongs\nto this layer as it translates the internal FIWARE data representation\
    \ in JSON from/to devices.\n•\nLayer 3: Data Management: contains software components\
    \ in charge of data storage, processing\nand distribution based on FIWARE GEs\
    \ (Orion, QuantumLeap, Cygnus and Cosmos) and SEPA\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n6 of\
    \ 20\nSPARQL engine. A mapper between FIWARE JSON NGSI and SEPA RDF data models\
    \ also belong\nto this layer, as well as a mapper from external data sources,\
    \ such as historical agriculture yield\ndatabases and weather forecast services.\
    \ A distributed infrastructure composed of cloud servers\nand fog nodes work together\
    \ for dealing with massive amounts of data and make it available to\nthe upper\
    \ layers.\n•\nLayer 4: Water Irrigation & Distribution Models: traditional agriculture\
    \ models for estimating\nplant water needs using images generated by drones (crop-based\
    \ approach) and using soil sensors\nfor determining soil moisture (soil-based\
    \ approach) belong to this layer. Optimization models and\ntechniques for water\
    \ distribution based on plant water needs are essential whenever collective\n\
    networks replace individual water sources. Also, computational intelligence (e.g.,\
    \ machine\nlearning) works together with traditional models or in place of them.\n\
    •\nLayer 5: Water Application Services: irrigation services that make sense to\
    \ farmers and water\ndistributors via user interfaces.\nDifferent layers of the\
    \ architecture are comprised of more generic components that are more\nprone to\
    \ be ported to other settings, whereas others are more application-speciﬁc and\

    \ scale, the SWAMP\narchitecture provides three categories of components: (a)\
    \ Fully Replicable Services: Layers 1, 2\nand 3 of the architecture are generic\
    \ enough to allow them to be replicable in different settings;\n(b) Fully Customizable\
    \ Services: Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the ﬁnal application\n\
    and therefore must be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques\
    \ and models\nof water distribution and irrigation, which may require customization\

    \ Field Fog Node.\nThis scenario represents the most complete and distributed\

    \ necessary \nin every system deployment of the SWAMP platform. \nFigure 6 also\
    \ highlights a hierarchical organization of the fog, divided into Fog Field Nodes\
    \ \n(FFN) and a Fog Hub in the farm office. A FFN has a stable power source and\
    \ provides data \ntransmission, storage and processing capabilities to the sensors\
    \ spread in a farm plot, i.e., behaving \nas an aggregation point for LPWAN devices\
    \ [28]. Irrigation systems like the center pivot can host a \nFFN or even drones.\
    \ Its implementation may be as simple as a LoRaWAN Gateway that forwards \ndata\
    \ to the Fog Hub or may include storage and processing. \nThe role played by the\
    \ Fog Hub may also vary depending on farmer’s requirements of \nrobustness to\
    \ Internet disconnections, which may be frequent in agriculture frontiers. The\
    \ \nfunctionalities provided by a Fog Hub may vary from a sensor aggregation point\
    \ to a full-fledged \nmini cloud data center if farmers are willing to have full\
    \ control of their irrigation systems. The \nSWAMP Cloud stores and processes\
    \ data and smart algorithms are based on existing agriculture \nmodels and on\

    \ pilot has to deal with \ncommunication instability, distance from the farm office\
    \ to the center pivot, and even distance from \nFigure 6. SWAMP Baseline Scenario\

    \ A FFN has a stable power source and provides data transmission,\nstorage and\

    \ from a sensor aggregation point to a full-ﬂedged mini cloud data center\nif\

    \ from the farm to\nthe nearest downtown area A center pivot irrigates a circular\
    \ agricultural plot of 100 hectares that\nalternates soybeans and cotton and the\
    \ plot is further divided into different management zones based\non differences\
    \ in the soil properties. The center pivot controls the variable rate irrigation\
    \ sprinklers\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n10 of 20\n(actuators). The authors developed\
    \ multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which include moisture,\ntemperature\
    \ and electrical conductivity sensors at three depths. In intensive agriculture\
    \ areas the plan\nis also to experiment ultra-low-power wireless sensor solutions\
    \ based on wake-up radios combined\nwith LoRaWAN [32].\nFigure 7 depicts the MATOPIBA\
    \ scenario where cloud and fog software components of the\nSWAMP Platform are\
    \ based on the SWAMP architecture (Figure 1). In order to represent different\n\
    system deployment possibilities, the picture shows two plots, where the topmost\
    \ plot uses a Field Fog\nNode (FFN) to aggregate sensor data and the bottommost\
    \ plot represents the sensors sending data\ndirectly to the Fog Hub. Currently,\
    \ both alternatives are under consideration but only one will be used\nin the\
    \ ﬁnal version of the pilot scenario.\n \nIn its simplest possible implementation,\
    \ the Field Fog Node only contains a LoRaWAN \ngateway. On the other hand, the\
    \ complexity of the communication and processing of sensor data is \ndealt with\
    \ by the Fog Hub. A LoRaWAN Gateway (located either in the FFN or in the Fog Hub)\
    \ \nforwards sensor data via a Mosquitto MQTT Broker [33] to a LoRa Server that\
    \ in turn sends the data \nto the FIWARE IoT Agent. The IoT Agent converts the\
    \ data format into NGSI, which goes to \nFIWARE Orion Context Broker. FIWARE Quantum\
    \ Leap is needed for different applications, such \nas the User Interface and\
    \ the Drone Platform. Also, a lightweight Fog Analytics component based on \n\
    simpler statistical techniques is used for computing the irrigation prescription\
    \ map whenever the \nInternet connection with the cloud is not available. \nThe\
    \ Cloud is represented with its essential components, which include a FIWARE central\

    \ (because\nsome components crashed after some time) and the number of received\
    \ messages are used to\nunderstand how experiments unfolded.\nThe experiments\
    \ involved a large number of sensors, sending data every 10 min. The scenarios\n\
    were executed with four different workloads determined by the number of sensors\
    \ sending messages\nsimultaneously. For the MATOPIBA, Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios,\
    \ 1000, 5000, 10,000 and\n15,000 sensors were used. For the CBEC scenario, as\
    \ depicted by Figure 11d, the workload was tripled,\ntotaling 3000, 15,000, 30,000\
    \ and 45,000 sensors. Each experiment took 1 min and was replicated\n30 times,\
    \ totalizing 16 h of running experiments. Asymptotic conﬁdence intervals were\
    \ calculated\nwith a 99% conﬁdence level.\nThe conﬁguration of WANem captured\
    \ characteristics of a connection from a farm to a cloud\nbased on a simple experiment\
    \ that obtained the network parameters by pinging a public cloud using a\n4G connection,\
    \ which resulted in a connection of 10 Mbps with 45 ms of delay and 5 ms of jitter.\n\
    6.2. Results\nFigure 12 depicts the main scalability results according to the\
    \ elapsed time metric and following\nthe methodology described above. MATOPIBA,\
    \ Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios are shown in\nFigure 12a and Table 1 and CBEC\
    \ scenario in Figure 12b. These results highlight important observations\nand\
    \ ﬁndings:\n•\nScalability limits: For MATOPIBA, Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios\
    \ the viable workload goes\nup to 10,000 sensors transmitting packets every 10\
    \ min (Figure 12a) where an elapsed time less\nthan 1 s was observed. Under a\
    \ workload of 15,000 sensors, Table 1 shows that the elapsed time\nincreases to\
    \ dozens of seconds with a high variation.\n•\nLightweight fog = no fog: The Guaspari\
    \ and Intercrop scenario yield very similar results for\nthe elapsed time, which\
    \ reveals that from a performance point of view there is no signiﬁcant\ndifference\
    \ if the MQTT Broker is placed in the fog or in the cloud.\n•\nCascading Orion:\
    \ The elapsed time is higher for the MATOPIBA compared to the Guaspari and\nIntercrop,\
    \ caused by the two cascading Orion components, in the fog and in the cloud, according\n\
    to Figure 11a. Whenever Orion receives a message it notiﬁes all subscribers of\
    \ the involved entity.\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n16 of 20\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ cloud Orion is a subscriber to the fog Orion, which means that in order for\
    \ the\nSubscriber to receive a message, it passes through two Orion notiﬁcation\
    \ steps, which is causing\nthe additional delay (up to one second with 10,000\
    \ sensors) and larger conﬁdence interval.\n•\nDivide and conquer: The CBEC scenario\
    \ has three farms represented by three SenSE trafﬁc\ngenerators in Figure 11d.\n\
    In order to scale up to 15,000 sensors per farm (which gives\n45,000 sensors),\
    \ the IoT Agent needed to be replicated in the cloud, each one in a new VM\nand\
    \ using a separate MongoDB instance. That solution increased the scalability for\
    \ the CBEC\nscenario, which were able not only to deal with 15,000 (which is not\
    \ viable in the other three\nscenarios), but also up to 45,000 sensors.\n \n\
    \ \nLightweight fog = no fog: The Guaspari and Intercrop scenario yield very similar\
    \ results for the \nelapsed time, which reveals that from a performance point\
    \ of view there is no significant \ndifference if the MQTT Broker is placed in\
    \ the fog or in the cloud. \n \nCascading Orion: The elapsed time is higher for\
    \ the MATOPIBA compared to the Guaspari and \nIntercrop, caused by the two cascading\
    \ Orion components, in the fog and in the cloud, \naccording to Figure 11a. Whenever\
    \ Orion receives a message it notifies all subscribers of the \ninvolved entity.\
    \ In this scenario, the cloud Orion is a subscriber to the fog Orion, which means\
    \ \nthat in order for the Subscriber to receive a message, it passes through two\
    \ Orion notification \nsteps, which is causing the additional delay (up to one\
    \ second with 10,000 sensors) and larger \nconfidence interval. \n \nDivide and\
    \ conquer: The CBEC scenario has three farms represented by three SenSE traffic\
    \ \ngenerators in Figure 11d. In order to scale up to 15,000 sensors per farm\
    \ (which gives 45,000 \nsensors), the IoT Agent needed to be replicated in the\
    \ cloud, each one in a new VM and using a \nseparate MongoDB instance. That solution\
    \ increased the scalability for the CBEC scenario, \nwhich were able not only\
    \ to deal with 15,000 (which is not viable in the other three scenarios), \nbut\

    \ of a component for collecting sensor data, like the FIWARE IoT Agent, which\
    \ must deal\nwith different combinations of data formats of sensors and wireless\
    \ technologies.\nDeployment: A variety of factors inﬂuence the design choices\
    \ for deployment alternatives of\nvarious fog/cloud conﬁguration scenarios: (a)\
    \ the stability and robustness of the Internet connection\nin the farm area, which\
    \ in some cases faces frequent disconnections that must be dealt with, such as\
    \ in\nthe Brazilian MATOPIBA pilot; (b) the availability of resources and interest\
    \ of farmers in maintaining\nan in-house fog-based IoT system in operation with\
    \ associated service level guarantees similar to a\ncloud environment, compared\
    \ to the disruptions caused by cloud intermittent access; (c) the capacity\nand\
    \ dependability of the fog nodes; (d) the use of LPWAN technologies for collecting\
    \ sensor data\nthat might require some minimum farm level infrastructure, such\
    \ as LoRaWAN, or relying on some\nyet-to-be-deployed or limited coverage public\
    \ service, such as NB-IoT or Sigfox [28]. There is no\n“one size ﬁts all” in IoT\
    \ systems for precision irrigation, which makes the case for ﬁnding different\
    \ ways\nof conﬁguring and connecting software components in cloud- and fog-based\
    \ deployments. The need\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n18 of 20\nfor an automated mechanism\
    \ for system deployment, given different requirements, infrastructures\nand constraints\
    \ was identiﬁed and it is currently handled within the project, but this is out\
    \ of the scope\nof this paper.\nScalability: Currently, most open IoT-based systems\
    \ that report results are proof-of-concept\npilots or small-scale IoT-based services.\
    \ Currently there is no de facto IoT Platform even though\nthere are many candidates,\
    \ including commercial solutions such as Amazon AWS IoT and Google\nCloud IoT.\
    \ FIWARE was adopted as the underlying IoT platform for the most common functions\n\
    of data distribution and storage. However, as our performance analysis revealed,\
    \ FIWARE still\nneeds signiﬁcant improvements to become a scalable solution for\
    \ extreme scenarios with heavy data\ngeneration. For example, the CBEC consortium\
    \ provides irrigation water for about 5000 farms and in\norder for the optimization\
    \ of water distribution to succeed they will need everything to be dealt with\n\
    by a single platform. For sure these large scenarios will require a considerable\
    \ number of devices that\nwill stress the platform even more than our experiments.\n\
    Complexity: There is a tradeoff in terms of dealing with complexity when it comes\
    \ to developing\nIoT-based applications. The approach taken in the CBEC scenario\
    \ is based on a hybrid solution that\ncombines a FIWARE-enabled context broker\
    \ and a semantic engine based on the linked data ontology\nmodel. While FIWARE\
    \ Orion Context Broker notiﬁes all subscribers whenever an entity is changed by\n\
    a publisher, the SEPA engine notiﬁes subscribers whenever the results of a semantic\
    \ query is changed,\nwhich is more powerful than a single entity. This conﬁguration\
    \ of the SWAMP Platform allows us to\ncompare a solution where the context broker\
    \ is simpler and the complexity dwells in the applications\n(FIWARE) to a solution\
    \ where the context broker is more complex and thus the applications can be\n\
    simpler (SEPA).\n8. Conclusions\nThe emergence of IoT is a phenomenon that owes\
    \ to the conjunction of several factors and now\nstarts to become real with huge\
    \ effort both in research and business areas. In this context, the SWAMP\nproject\
    \ develops IoT-based methods for smart water management in precision irrigation,\
    \ and pilots\nthem in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. This paper introduced the SWAMP\
    \ architecture, pilots and deployment\nscenarios for the four pilots using FIWARE\
    \ as the underlying IoT platform.\nA performance analysis of key FIWARE components\
    \ personalized for each SWAMP pilot scenario\nwas undertaken to understand the\
    \ scalability limits of the system. The results show that this platform\nmight\
    \ be able to deal with the performance requirements of our pilots, even though\
    \ requiring specially\ndesigned deployment conﬁgurations and the re-engineering\
    \ of some components to provide higher\nscalability using less computational resources.\
    \ Particularly, our experiments showed that MongoDB is\nCPU greedy, which negatively\
    \ impacts system performance.\nSWAMP is an ongoing project and therefore there\
    \ are multiple paths for future work. Some\nexamples are improving the platform\
    \ deployment scenarios, reporting the overall working of the\nSWAMP approach in\
    \ the pilots, including the experience with irrigation models and analytics and\n\
    more advanced performance analysis.\nAuthor Contributions: SWAMP is a collaborative\

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Remote and proximal sensing data are used in various ways for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) to measure and respond to the spatial and temporal variability of soil and
    crop growth conditions. For example, proximal sensors can measure soil moisture

    \ the challenge of feeding a growing population with limited or depleting\nfresh\
    \ water resources. Advances in irrigation systems and technologies allow site-speciﬁc\
    \ application\nof irrigation water within the ﬁeld to improve water use efﬁciency\
    \ or reduce water usage for\nsustainable crop production, especially in arid and\
    \ semi-arid regions. This paper discusses recent\ndevelopment of variable-rate\
    \ irrigation (VRI) technologies, data and information for VRI application,\nand\
    \ impacts of VRI, including proﬁtability using this technology, with a focus on\
    \ agronomic factors\nin precision water management. The development in sprinkler\
    \ systems enabled irrigation application\nwith greater precision at the scale\
    \ of individual nozzle control. Further research is required to evaluate\nVRI\
    \ prescription maps integrating different soil and crop characteristics in different\
    \ environments.\nOn-farm trials and whole-ﬁeld studies are needed to provide support\
    \ information for practical\nVRI applications. Future research also needs to address\
    \ the adjustment of the spatial distribution of\nprescription zones in response\
    \ to temporal variability in soil water status and crop growing conditions,\n\
    which can be evaluated by incorporating remote and proximal sensing data. Comprehensive\

    \ use and crop production based on the regional climate\nconditions and cropping\
    \ systems.\nKeywords: variable-rate irrigation; precision agriculture; irrigation\
    \ scheduling\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the largest consumer of the world′s\
    \ available fresh water, as plant growth largely\ndepends on the availability\
    \ of water. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),\ncurrent\
    \ world irrigated area is approximately 300 million ha, and projection to 2050\
    \ suggests growing\nscarcities of water resources for agriculture, although water\
    \ is a renewable resource. This situation has\nampliﬁed the intensity of global\
    \ food insecurity, climate change, and poverty. The greatest challenge\nto agriculture\
    \ is to provide food and ﬁber for almost 8 billion people around the world in\
    \ the advent of\ndepleting freshwater resources [1].\nThe challenge is more prominent\
    \ in the arid and semi-arid regions, where underground water\nsources, especially\
    \ aquifers are used for irrigation, as rainfall provides only a portion of the\
    \ total\nrequirement for crop evapotranspiration (ET) demand [2]. Heavy irrigation\
    \ has caused rapid depletion\nof many aquifers. For instance, comparing the water\
    \ level of the Ogallala aquifer in the 1950s to that\nof 2013, in some wells,\
    \ up to 78 m of water was depleted in the Texas High Plains area [3]. This is\n\
    almost 12 times the average decline of 4.5 m for the whole area of the aquifer.\
    \ Given this depletion rate,\nscientists have predicted that 35% of the Southern\
    \ High Plains will not be able to support irrigation in\n30 years. Many other\
    \ water resources in the world are depleting rapidly in recent years with negligible\n\
    recharge, indicating the need for water conservation solutions in agriculture\
    \ [4,5]. More effective and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87; doi:10.3390/agronomy9020087\n\

    \ of water is required to better conserve water and improve water use efﬁciency\n\
    for sustainable crop production.\nConventional farming practices manage an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld uniformly without incorporating\nthe intrinsic variability in topography,\
    \ soil, crop growth conditions, and other agronomic factors.\nThis can result\
    \ in nutrient leaching, environmental contamination, and reduced proﬁtability\
    \ especially\nwhen applying high inputs in low yielding areas and vice versa [6,7].\
    \ Precision agriculture can be\nadopted to divide the ﬁeld into small management\
    \ units for optimized production [8]. There are\nseveral deﬁnitions for precision\
    \ agriculture, and it keeps evolving with emerging technologies and\nunderstanding\
    \ of what is achievable [9]. The idea of precision agriculture or site-speciﬁc\
    \ management\nstarted around the early 1980s with the development of various technologies\
    \ to assess ﬁeld variabilities\nsuch as soil survey, soil testing and mapping,\
    \ and crop yield monitoring [10–13]. Precision agriculture\ndepends on detailed\
    \ spatial information, information technology, greater information processing\n\
    capability, and better decision aids [14]. Precision agriculture is a management\
    \ system that measures\nand responds to the spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ soil and crop growth at the sub-ﬁeld level\nwith the aim to enhance proﬁtability\
    \ and reduce environmental impact [15,16]. Major technologies\ninvolved in precision\
    \ agriculture include geographic information systems (GIS), remote and proximal\n\
    sensing, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), yield monitoring and the variable\
    \ rate technology.\nGeoreferenced information about soil and plant characteristics\
    \ can be obtained efﬁciently using GIS,\nproximal sensors and remote sensors [17].\
    \ Application of yield monitors provides the capability to\nprecisely characterize\
    \ yield variability at large scales in the ﬁeld. Moreover, the variable rate technology\n\
    provides the ability to site-speciﬁcally apply irrigation water in the ﬁeld to\
    \ achieve potential water\nsavings [18]. This enables the timely and accurate\
    \ water application incorporating the spatial and\ntemporal soil properties and\
    \ plant demand at different growth stages [15]. In other words, the variable\n\
    rate irrigation (VRI) technology can help to apply the right amount of water in\
    \ the right area of the\nﬁeld at the right time resulting in water savings.\n\
    Recent research suggests site-speciﬁc management of water or VRI could be a solution\
    \ to conserve\nwater and improve water use efﬁciency (WUE), which is the ratio\
    \ between effective water use and\nactual water withdrawal in the ﬁeld [19]. VRI\
    \ can support water and energy conservation with a\npositive inﬂuence on crop\
    \ water productivity and the environment [20]. This is possible by applying\n\
    irrigation at rates that vary to appropriately match ﬁeld variability based on\
    \ speciﬁc water needs\nof individual management zones rather than applying a uniform\
    \ rate throughout the ﬁeld [21].\nThe magnitude of soil water content (SWC) varies\
    \ with time and location, but the pattern of spatial\nvariability usually remains\
    \ similar. This temporal stability of SWC is associated with properties of the\n\
    ﬁeld such as topography, soil texture, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa)\
    \ and drainage patterns\nthat insigniﬁcantly change over time [22,23]. The feasibility\
    \ and effectiveness of VRI depend on the\nsize of the ﬁeld, crop species under\
    \ consideration, weather, and the underlying ﬁeld properties such as\nelevation,\
    \ slope, soil texture, and ECa that inﬂuence soil moisture content and irrigation\
    \ requirements\nfor the crop [24,25]. Hence, understanding the inﬂuence of agronomic\
    \ factors such as topography and\nsoil properties on soil water and ultimately\
    \ yield can provide a basis for application of VRI in the ﬁeld\nto achieve potential\
    \ water savings together with yield optimization.\nToday, site-speciﬁc water management\
    \ has been made easier with several precision agriculture\ntools, such as GNSS,\
    \ GIS, yield mapping, soil survey and remote sensing [26]. Several decision support\n\
    tools and strategies to reduce groundwater withdrawal without reductions in irrigated\
    \ land area or\ncrop productivity have been developed [4]. The measures to optimize\
    \ the use of irrigation water in\nthe ﬁelds include increasing weather-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling, converting gravity-based irrigation\nto center pivot irrigation,\
    \ subsurface drip irrigation, replacing high water to low water demand\ncrops,\
    \ and deﬁcit irrigation based on evapotranspiration replacement using various\
    \ water-balance\nmodels [27]. Several studies have been done to understand the\
    \ possible water savings with VRI.\nA review on VRI across different crop and\
    \ weather regimes of the world concluded that VRI could save\n10%–15% of water\
    \ [28]. Although the use of VRI seems to be a reasonable measure to improve water\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n3 of 21\nmanagement, many producers are reluctant to adopt\
    \ it because limited research is done at the ﬁeld scale\nto understand its reliability\
    \ and economic potential [25]. A better understanding of ﬁeld variability and\n\
    how it affects crop yield is needed for effective implementation of the new technologies.\
    \ A review for\nsite-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation [29] focused on the technology\
    \ and challenges for adoption. Another\nreview of 20 years’ research on increasing\
    \ crop productivity with sprinkler and micro-irrigation\ndiscussed the importance\
    \ of understanding the crop response to VRI [30]. The study emphasized the\nneed\
    \ for continuous effort towards management zone delineation based on ﬁeld properties\
    \ integrated\nwith dynamic information from real-time monitoring of climatological\
    \ and crop data. However,\nthis study focused more on the technological aspect\
    \ of irrigation management than the agronomic\naspect of water conservation with\
    \ VRI. The agricultural science behind VRI is equally crucial for\nthe successful\
    \ implementation of this technology. Hence, the objective of this paper is to\
    \ review the\nscientiﬁc background and technologies in precision water management,\
    \ with the focus on agronomic\nfactors and strategies for site-speciﬁc water management.\n\
    2. Variable-Rate Irrigation Technologies\nThe irrigation system changed from gravity-based\
    \ furrow irrigation in the 1950s to sprinkler\nirrigation in late 1990s. Initially,\
    \ the high-pressure sprinkler irrigation system was available in the\n1980s which\
    \ later developed to low-pressure sprinklers and low-energy precision application\
    \ (LEPA)\nin 1990s [31–33]. About 49% of total irrigated land in the United States\
    \ is irrigated with center pivot\nsystems, out of which 44% is irrigated at low\
    \ pressure under 30 psi [34]. The basic requirements for the\nVRI technology are\
    \ sensors and spatial information, prescription maps and a system to incorporate\
    \ VRI\nprescription (e.g., LEPA, lateral irrigation, etc.) to apply in the ﬁeld\
    \ [35]. At present, there are several\nirrigation technologies for conservation\
    \ irrigation, such as sprinkler, drip, and other micro-irrigation\nsystems but\
    \ limited site-speciﬁc studies have been done [30,36–38]. For example, a study\
    \ of the\nvariable-rate drip irrigation system on vineyard found up to 17% increase\
    \ in yield and a 20% decrease\nin water consumption compared to uniform irrigation\
    \ [39]. Researchers in the UK assessed the potential\nof hose-reel boom irrigators\
    \ for precision irrigation in vegetables [40]. Automatic gravity-fed irrigation\n\
    systems in Europe decreased manual labor and supported adoption by innovative\
    \ farmers [41].\nVariable-rate irrigation using center pivot in rice showed better\
    \ performance compared to uniform\nﬂooding irrigation [42]. In this review, we\
    \ will focus more on those irrigation technologies that have\nbeen used for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management more frequently around the world, such as variable-rate\nlateral\
    \ irrigation systems and center pivot irrigation systems.\nThe components of a\
    \ variable-rate lateral irrigation system commonly consist of a GPS or GNSS\n\
    receiver, custom software-controlled relays and valves, which can apply variable\
    \ water utilizing the\nnozzle-pulsing technique and a variable speed control system.\
    \ This system can control the irrigation\nrate and forward speed with high accuracy\
    \ [43]. Similarly, the components of a center pivot VRI system\ninclude a pivot\
    \ control panel, a VRI control panel, solenoid valves, control nodes, a GNSS system,\n\
    a variable frequency drive and a remote-control system [21]. The pivot control\
    \ regulates the operation\nand speed of the pivot, while the VRI control panel\
    \ regulates the irrigation application rate in response\nto the prescription map\
    \ and the pivot location. Solenoid valves regulate the ﬂow of sprinkler heads.\n\
    The GNSS system at the end of the center pivot provides the pivot position. The\
    \ control nodes along\nthe length of the pivot determine when the valves are open\
    \ or close. The variable frequency drive\n(VFD) helps to regulate the pressure\
    \ while instantaneously changing the rate of irrigation at different\npositions\
    \ of the ﬁeld. The VFD controls the rotation speed of the pump impeller by receiving\
    \ the input\nfrom a pressure switch installed on the pump outlet pipe. This keeps\
    \ water pressure stable within\npreset maximum and minimum thresholds and thus\
    \ saving water and energy. The remote control\nsystem allows to view and control\
    \ the center pivot and the pump from a distance via a smartphone or\na computer\
    \ using the internet [21]. Further, research and development are striving to control\
    \ irrigation\namount with VRI controllers using real-time information from plant\
    \ and soil sensors in the ﬁeld [44].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n4 of 21\nCurrently,\
    \ several companies work on the manufacture and application of this technology.\n\
    The commercially available VRI control resolution varies with the manufacturers.\
    \ VRI systems\ncan apply zero water to speciﬁc nozzles and as much as 200% of\
    \ the standard application rate\nto other nozzles by opening or closing individual\
    \ nozzles and by changing the speed of the\npivot [45]. Some companies provide\
    \ the ability to control zones of sprinklers, while others can\ncontrol each sprinkler\
    \ independently [46]. For example, Valley (Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley,\
    \ NE,\nUSA) provides variable speed control and variable zone control technologies\
    \ for site-speciﬁc water\napplication. The variable speed control system uses\
    \ an advanced control panel that can slow down or\nspeed up the pivot to vary\
    \ water input in different areas (sectors) of the ﬁeld, but the overall pivot\
    \ ﬂow\nrate remains constant. This system does not need additional hardware on\
    \ the existing pivot irrigation\nsystem. The variable zone control system can\
    \ vary the speed of the center and change the application\nrate along the pivot\
    \ lateral. This system applies different irrigation depths to different areas\
    \ of the ﬁeld\nby turning sprinklers on and off for various amounts of time. Trimble\
    \ (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale,\nCA, USA) has developed the Irrigate-IQ Variable-Rate\
    \ Irrigation System. This system incorporates\nthe VFD and variable speed drive\
    \ (VSD) into the recent optimal ﬂow VRI that works with standard\npump equipment\
    \ on wells with limited capacity. This system is capable of individual nozzle\
    \ control,\nwhich can apply the right amount of water in the right place more\
    \ accurately [47]. Currently, it is\npossible to achieve sector control with very\
    \ small resolution, and zone control can add irrigation zones\nfurther to the\
    \ sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study conducted\
    \ in Canada to\nevaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy of water\
    \ application was up to 90% in the\ncenter pivot system [49]. However, the performance\
    \ of these irrigation systems in ﬁeld applications is\naffected by many factors,\
    \ such as ﬁeld attributes, the spatial resolution of the sensors used in irrigation\n\
    management and temporal resolution of data inputs, as well as unexpected environmental\
    \ conditions.\nHence, adaptive irrigation management strategies and active research\
    \ support are required to enhance\nthe adoption and application of VRI [20,50].\n\

    \ to the sector at the small scales of lateral spans (Figure 1) [48]. A study\
    \ \nconducted in Canada to evaluate the performance of VRI found that the accuracy\
    \ of water application \nwas up to 90% in the center pivot system [49]. However,\
    \ the performance of these irrigation systems \nin field applications is affected\
    \ by many factors, such as field attributes, the spatial resolution of the \n\
    sensors used in irrigation management and temporal resolution of data inputs,\
    \ as well as unexpected \nenvironmental conditions. Hence, adaptive irrigation\
    \ management strategies and active research \nsupport are required to enhance\
    \ the adoption and application of VRI [20,50]. \n \nFigure 1. Prescription maps\

    \ of soil properties and crop growth conditions that affect water availability,\n\
    water requirement, water use efﬁciency, crop growth, and crop yield. Topography\
    \ and soil properties\nare important factors that inﬂuence water availability\
    \ for crop growth. The variability of soil and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n5 of 21\n\
    topographic properties combined can explain 28% to 85% of yield variability [51].\
    \ Hence, it is critical\nto quantify the variability of terrain attributes and\
    \ soil properties for VRI applications.\n3.1. Topography\nTopographic variation\
    \ is a common characteristic of large agricultural ﬁelds that result in spatial\n\
    variability of soil water and ultimately crop yield [52]. Topography or terrain\
    \ has two types of attributes,\nprimary and secondary attributes [53]. Primary\
    \ attributes include elevation, slope, aspect, curvature,\nﬂow length, and upslope\
    \ contributing area. Secondary attributes are derived empirically from several\n\
    primary attributes to characterize speciﬁc processes manifesting in the landscape,\
    \ mainly including\nsediment transport index (STI), stream power index (SPI),\
    \ ﬂow direction, ﬂow accumulation, distance\nto ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL),\
    \ and wetness index [53,54]. Topographic properties affect soil physical\nand\
    \ chemical properties such as texture (sand, silt, and clay content), pH, CaCO3,\
    \ extractable Ca and\nMg, available K, base saturation, organic matter, and cation\
    \ exchange capacity (CEC). Topography also\ninﬂuences hydrologic properties and\
    \ processes and can account for up to 50% of water availability\ndifferences in\
    \ the same ﬁeld [52]. Elevation, slope and surface curvatures directly affect\
    \ inﬁltration and\nrunoff as they inﬂuence the surface and subsurface ﬂow of water\
    \ in the ﬁeld [55,56]. This can have a\nsigniﬁcant effect on crop growth and yield,\
    \ resulting in differences in crop production of up to 69% at\ndifferent positions\
    \ in the ﬁeld [57–59].\nA study conducted in central Illinois and eastern Indiana\
    \ showed that topography alone could\nexplain about 20% of yield variability [60].\
    \ Corn yield variability was consistently correlated with\nelevation and slope\
    \ in a three-year study in Southern Portugal [53]. This study showed that topographic\n\
    indices, such as distance to ﬂow accumulation lines (DFL), were negatively correlated\
    \ with yield,\nhence could be used to evaluate spatial yield variability. A research\
    \ conducted on a 7.4-ha ﬁeld in the\nSouthern High Plains of Texas showed cotton\
    \ lint yield was negatively correlated with site elevation.\nThe lint yield and\
    \ nitrogen (N) uptake was higher in bottom slope positions than in upslope, possibly\n\
    due to the accumulation of run-off water and NO3-N eroded from the upper slope\
    \ areas. However,\nthis trend depended on weather conditions. For a wet year when\
    \ there was over accumulation of water\nin bottom slopes, lower yield in bottom\
    \ slopes and higher yield in upper slopes were observed [61].\nRelative elevation\
    \ explained up to 49% of water content variation in the soil and 32% of lint yield\n\
    variation in the ﬁeld. The negative correlation between crop yield and elevation\
    \ could be in part due\nto the effect of erosion and topographical attributes\
    \ on soil properties that inﬂuence inﬁltration and\nstorage of water. Slope length\
    \ also affects crop yield by inﬂuencing N denitriﬁcation, soil N, P, K,\nCa and\
    \ Mg distributions, soil carbon storage, and nitrate distribution, as well as\
    \ the inﬁltration rate of\nwater in the ﬁeld [62].\nThe curvature of the ﬁeld\
    \ surface determines the concentration or dispersion of surface water\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld [55]. Concave surface with negative curvatures concentrates water ﬂow,\
    \ while convex\nsurface with positive curvature disperses water ﬂow [63]. For\
    \ example, SWC was found strongly\ncorrelated with soil surface curvature (r =\
    \ 0.9) [64]. Soil surface curvature can explain up to 15% of\nvariations in the\
    \ crop yield [65]. Corn yield was negatively correlated with surface curvature\
    \ in another\nresearch [53]. In this study, corn yield was 14% higher in concave\
    \ curvatures than convex areas. In a\nsix-year study [55], corn yields were negatively\
    \ correlated with elevation, slope, planar curvature and\nproﬁle curvature for\
    \ the wet years. The impact of surface curvature on crop yield also depends on\n\
    weather conditions and the location to some extent. Weather factors have the largest\
    \ effect on grain\nyield at locations with large curvature values. In some cases,\
    \ surface curvature is positively related to\ncrop yield at locations or years\
    \ with higher precipitation [60]. The magnitude of curvature also has\nan impact\
    \ on crop yield. The effect of curvature on crop yield between wet and dry years\
    \ are highly\ndifferent at locations with small curvature [66]. Hence, understanding\
    \ and incorporating topographic\nattributes of the ﬁeld, such as elevation, slope\
    \ length and aspect, surface curvature and their inﬂuence\non water dynamics can\
    \ be an important input for site-speciﬁc water management to achieve potential\n\
    water savings and optimized production.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n6 of 21\n3.2. Soil\
    \ Properties\nSoil functions as a medium for plant growth, a regulator of water\
    \ ﬂow and nutrient cycling.\nIt is a dynamic entity where complex interactions\
    \ occur among its physical, chemical and biological\nproperties to enable these\
    \ functions [67]. Soil forming factors such as parent material, biota, topography,\n\
    climate, and time are variable in time and space and explain most of the soil\
    \ variability besides the\nmanagement induced variability [11]. Spatial variability\
    \ of chemical properties including nutrients,\norganic matter, and pH can result\
    \ in within-ﬁeld variation in available water content and crop\nproductivity [68].\
    \ Complex spatial patterns of soil physical properties also affect soil water\
    \ availability\nand rooting of a plant, resulting in variability in crop growth\
    \ and yield [69]. Soil texture, organic matter\ncontent, apparent electrical conductivity,\
    \ and biological properties are relatively stable properties of\nthe ﬁeld that\
    \ are usually considered for site-speciﬁc management of the ﬁeld.\n3.2.1. Soil\
    \ Texture\nSoil texture, the relative content of sand, silt, and clay particles,\
    \ is an important soil physical\nproperty that affects crop growth and yield.\
    \ Soil texture determines the rate at which water drains\nthrough saturated soil\
    \ and inﬂuences available water-holding capacity. Therefore, it affects the\n\
    distribution of available water for plant growth and irrigation requirements in\
    \ the ﬁeld. Fine sandy\nloams and silts tend to have the highest water-holding\
    \ capacity, while an increase in either clay\nor sand content in the soil proﬁle\
    \ decreases the water-holding capacity [70]. The matric potential\nof soil, which\
    \ depends on soil particle size, inﬂuences the availability of soil water. For\
    \ example,\nclay particles have higher matric potential and lower soil available\
    \ water compared to sand and silt\nparticles [71]. Soil texture also affects the\
    \ spatial variability of residual NO3-N and the leaching of N.\nMore residual\
    \ was found in sandy loam soils compared to loamy sand, and leaching was higher\
    \ in\nloamy sand compared to sandy loam [72]. Soil texture also affects the pore\
    \ sizes and porosity of the soil,\nwhich ultimately affects crop root growth and\
    \ yield by limiting the water available to the plant and the\ngrowth space for\
    \ the roots [73]. In general, soils with high clay content are more difﬁcult to\
    \ manage\ndue to lack of porosity and water available for plant growth. On the\
    \ other hand, well-drained soils\nhave good soil aeration for healthy root and\
    \ crop growth [74]. The clay content can also inﬂuence soil\nwater and nutrient\
    \ content and result in crop yield variability across the ﬁeld [61,75]. A study\
    \ showed\nthat clay content in the soil could explain up to 17% variability in\
    \ winter wheat yield by affecting\nthe water available in the soil for crop growth\
    \ [76]. A study conducted in the Southern High Plains\nshowed that a very sandy\
    \ soil (the Brownﬁeld soil series) with high slope consistently had low yield\n\
    when given the same amount of irrigation water, fertilizer, seed population, and\
    \ other management\npractices [56]. A cross-correlation study conducted between\
    \ cotton lint yield, soil water, clay, sand and\nelevation in a 45-ha ﬁeld in\
    \ Texas High Plains also showed that correlation among these factors varied\n\
    between 0.72 and 0.63 and cotton crop and soil physical properties could be correlated\
    \ within 60 to\n80 m across the ﬁeld [77]. In summary, soil texture inﬂuences\
    \ variability in water availability and crop\nyield, and hence should be considered\
    \ in VRI planning and implementation [78].\n3.2.2. Soil Organic Matter (SOM)\n\
    The role of SOM in VRI lies in its inﬂuence on water-holding capacity because\
    \ the afﬁnity SOM has\nfor water [74]. SOM has a positive inﬂuence on yield, and\
    \ the inﬂuence is more prominent in soils with\nlow organic matter content [60].\
    \ SOM distribution in the ﬁeld is variable depending upon topography\nand other\
    \ soil properties. Accumulation of SOM often occurs at the bottom of slopes, possibly\
    \ due to\nthe run-off of organic matter from higher areas and increased plant\
    \ growth at low-lying wet areas of the\nﬁeld [60,61]. SOM generally increases\
    \ with increasing clay content. The organic matter in ﬁne-textured\nsoils such\
    \ as clay can be two to four times that of coarse-textured sandy soils under similar\
    \ climatic\nconditions, which in turn, can inﬂuence soil water holding capacity\
    \ [79]. Therefore, understanding the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n7 of 21\norganic matter\
    \ distribution in the ﬁeld can help in estimation of irrigation requirements for\
    \ the ﬁeld\nand hence should be incorporated in developing site-speciﬁc water\
    \ management.\n3.2.3. Soil Biological Properties\nMost site-speciﬁc studies did\
    \ not consider spatial variability of soil organisms, but recent studies\nhave\
    \ shown that the spatial distribution of soil organisms inﬂuence plant growth\
    \ and possibly yield [80].\nSpatial and temporal distribution of microorganisms\
    \ at the landscape scale is complicated by the\ninteractions among topography,\
    \ soil type and distribution of water in the ﬁeld [81]. The management\nactivity\
    \ in the ﬁeld can inﬂuence the distribution of soil biological components and\
    \ this, in turn,\naffects the efﬁciency of agricultural management [82]. The soil\
    \ has the greatest microbial diversity\namong all ecosystems that support soil\
    \ conditioning and plant growth [83]. A study conducted in\nFrance [84] showed\
    \ that microbial indicators expressed a high spatial heterogeneity at the ﬁeld\
    \ level,\nwhich masked the effects of several soil and crop management treatments.\
    \ The results also showed\nthat the spatial variability due to biological variables\
    \ was similar in magnitude as compared to that\nexhibited by physicochemical parameters,\
    \ which indicated the feasibility of site-speciﬁc management\nof biological variability\
    \ in the ﬁeld using management zones. Such site-speciﬁc management can be\neffective\
    \ since organisms such as earthworms, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and\
    \ different\narthropods play a vital role in soil fertility and productivity [71].\n\
    3.2.4. Apparent Soil Electrical Conductivity (ECa)\nObtaining accurate information\
    \ about the spatial and temporal variability of SWC and irrigation\nrequirements\
    \ is one of the important challenges in site-speciﬁc water management.\nECa is\
    \ a\nmeasurement of ﬁeld variability that can be applied to precise water management\
    \ because it is\neasy to measure and facilitates the spatial understanding of\
    \ the soil-water-plant relationship [85].\nECa is a function of several soil properties,\
    \ such as soil salinity, texture, bulk density, ion concentration,\ntype and amount\
    \ of clay, topsoil thickness, and water content [86]. The effect of ECa on crop\
    \ yield is\nthrough its relation to soil properties, which depends on climate,\
    \ crop type and other speciﬁc ﬁeld\nconditions [87]. In general, high ECa is associated\
    \ with high clay content in the soil [88]. For example,\na study conducted near\
    \ Lamesa, Texas, showed that in four of the six sites, shallow ECa measured\n\
    with a Veris mapping system was positively correlated with clay content. Clay\
    \ content was negatively\nrelated to shallow ECa at one site due to the low bulk\
    \ density of the calcic horizon [89]. Most of the\nresearch conducted did not\
    \ consider the spatial correlation of soil characteristics when evaluating\ntheir\
    \ distributions. However, spatial autocorrelation of soil properties can be more\
    \ important than\nsoil properties themselves in explaining ECa. Therefore, future\
    \ studies need to incorporate the\nspatial correlation of soil characteristics\
    \ in evaluating the impact of ECa on crop yield [90]. ECa has\nthe potential to\
    \ differentiate between soils when the soils have enough water content and can\n\
    be used as an indicator of SWC. In general, areas with high ECa are associated\
    \ with high water\ncontent [91]. Several studies have shown a higher correlation\
    \ of crop growth characteristics and yield\nwith ECa [92,93]. A study showed that\
    \ ECa in combination with topographic attributes and bare soil\nbrightness could\
    \ explain up to 70.1% of the variability in cotton yield [56]. Hence, understanding\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal variability of ECa provides information for site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management\nfor optimized yield.\nThe association between crop yield\
    \ and soil physical and chemical properties and landscape\nprocesses provide opportunities\
    \ to improve water management at the landscape scale [61].\nSoil properties and\
    \ topography inﬂuence crop yield from microscales to watershed scales and the\n\
    magnitude of complexity increases with the scale due to an increase in soil and\
    \ topographical variability,\nas well as variability in rainfall, temperature\
    \ and other climatic factors [60]. A study showed lower\ncorn grain and stover\
    \ yield in depositional and ﬂat areas which retained water for longer periods,\n\
    and high yield at well-drained summit positions [94]. In the same research for\
    \ alfalfa and poplar,\nthe results showed higher productivity at a site with a\
    \ relatively steep slope and potentially erosive\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n8 of 21\n\
    soils. This relationship was attributed to the above-normal rainfall in both years\
    \ of study. In a six-year\nstudy to understand corn yield in relation to terrain\
    \ attributes, two years with more than normal\nprecipitation showed a positive\
    \ correlation between yield and slope. For the other four years, yield was\nnegatively\
    \ correlated with slope [55]. Crop yield in relation to soil properties and topography\
    \ depends\non different soil management and climate conditions. The correlation\
    \ was found to be stronger for\ndry years in degraded soils and attributed to\
    \ differences in water availability. This suggests that\nvariable-rate irrigation\
    \ strategies might require adjustments in different crop seasons with different\n\
    climatic and management conditions and hence more researches on VRI are needed\
    \ [95].\n4. Crop and Soil Monitoring for Precision Water Management\nWater requirement\
    \ varies with the crop and crop growth and development status, soil water status,\n\
    as well as environmental conditions. Closely monitoring soil water status, crop\
    \ growth conditions and\ntheir spatial and temporal patterns can aid in irrigation\
    \ scheduling and precise water management.\nAmong many tools, remote sensing can\
    \ serve an effective basis by providing images with spatial\nand temporal variability\
    \ of crop growth parameters and soil moisture status for input in precision\n\
    water management.\n4.1. Crop Coefﬁcient and ET\nVRI aims at increasing WUE and\
    \ stabilizing yield, which can be improved by scheduling\nthe irrigation of crops\
    \ using physical and agronomic principles in irrigation management strategy.\n\
    WUE (kg/m3) can be expressed as the ratio of the amount of target product of the\
    \ crop to the amount\nof water applied to produce that output. The amount of water\
    \ used for crop production is the amount\nrequired to overcome the water lost\
    \ by ET from plant and soil surface, and it varies spatiotemporally\naccording\
    \ to weather and vegetation cover conditions [96,97]. Climatological parameters\
    \ such as\nsolar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, and crop\
    \ and soil water characteristics,\nincluding management and environmental aspects,\
    \ are important parameters inﬂuencing ET in\nagricultural ﬁelds. Since ET is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure, reference ET from a hypothetical grass reference\nsurface is commonly\
    \ calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation based on meteorological\n\
    parameters [98]. The equation is expressed as follows,\nET0 = [0.408 ∆ (Rn − G)\
    \ + γ {900/(T + 273)} u2 (es − ea)]/[∆ + γ (1 + 0.34 u2)]\nwhere, ET0—Reference\
    \ evapotranspiration [mm day−1], Rn—Net radiation at the crop surface [MJ\nm−2\
    \ day−1], G—Soil heat ﬂux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T—Air temperature at 2 m height\
    \ [◦C],\nu2—Wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es—Saturation vapor pressure [kPa],\
    \ ea—Actual vapor pressure\n[kPa], es—ea saturation vapor pressure deﬁcit [kPa],\
    \ D—Slope vapor pressure curve [kPa ◦C−1],\nγ—Psychrometric constant [kPa ◦C−1].\n\
    Crop-speciﬁc evapotranspiration needs are calculated based on crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (Kc). By using\nthe FAO Penman-Monteith deﬁnition for ET0, crop coefﬁcients\
    \ at research sites could be calculated by\nrelating the measured crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) with the calculated ET0, i.e., Kc = ET/ET0. The crop\ncoefﬁcient differs\
    \ widely between crops and among growth stages for the same crop. This Kc factor\n\
    serves as an aggregation of the physical and physiological differences among crops\
    \ and averaged\neffects of evaporation from the soil [98]. Several spatial models\
    \ have been developed for ET estimation,\nwhich showed that accurate spatial ET\
    \ and water-balance models could be of great importance in VRI\napplication [61,99,100].\n\
    4.2. Remote and Proximal Sensing\nBesides crop coefﬁcient and ET, mapping soil\
    \ properties in a ﬁeld, such as ﬁeld capacity and\nroot zone water availability,\
    \ is also important for site-speciﬁc water management [101]. Information\nregarding\
    \ variability of plant conditions such as water stress, growth parameters, ground\
    \ cover can also\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n9 of 21\nprovide a basis for VRI. Remote\
    \ sensing using various sensors and platforms is often used to estimate\nseveral\
    \ soil and crop characteristics during the growing season that can provide important\
    \ information\nin decision support. The near-real-time information from several\
    \ sensors, such as spectral reﬂectance\nsensors and infrared thermometers have\
    \ been used to develop ﬁeld maps for water, vegetation,\nand nutrient status [50,102].\
    \ Remotely sensed images can be useful in determining leaf area index and\nground\
    \ cover for a ﬁeld and thus help in yield forecasting [103]. Remote sensing can\
    \ also help estimate\nET more reliably from individual ﬁelds [104]. A study in\
    \ Nebraska evaluated remote-sensing-based\nET and a water-balance model for irrigation\
    \ management [105]. In this study, four irrigation treatment\ncombinations were\
    \ tested: VRI based on water-balance model using remote sensing, VRI based on\n\
    water-balance model using neutron probe, uniform irrigation based on neutron-probe\
    \ measurement\nand rainfed. Landsat 7 and 8 imageries were used for model input\
    \ in a remote sensing-based\nmodel, which included reﬂectance-based crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for ET estimation. The result showed\nthat remote sensing-based treatment had\
    \ the greatest mean prescribed irrigation, which was attributed\nto water-balance\
    \ drift. The study concluded that the remote-sensing-based model might perform\n\
    better when coupled with SWC measurement. This can be helpful in site-speciﬁc\
    \ management of\nirrigation water, as well as weedicide, pesticide and other chemicals\
    \ [106–108]. Various indices\nderived from thermal and multispectral images, such\
    \ as crop water stress index (CWSI), perpendicular\nvegetation index (PVI), normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) and photochemical reﬂectance\nindex (PRI),\
    \ can predict soil or plant water status and drought stress as a basis for site-speciﬁc\
    \ water\nmanagement [109,110]. Use of digital infrared thermography to measure\
    \ canopy temperature can\nhelp producers to detect early crop water stress and\
    \ avoid yield declines as well as saving water\nwith site-speciﬁc irrigation management\
    \ and irrigation scheduling [111,112]. Recent improvements in\nremote and proximal\
    \ sensing technologies such as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial\n\
    systems (UAS) have increased the efﬁciency for farmers to exercise site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation management.\nIndices derived from high-resolution UAS imagery have\
    \ shown the potential to predict crop water\nstress indicators such as water potential\
    \ and stomatal conductance [113]. Such information can aid in\nimproving irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Although soil\n\
    moisture sensors are found to be more proﬁtable in the present context, with the\
    \ increasing number\nof manufacturers and clear regulations, UAS-based sensor\
    \ technology for soil moisture estimation\nis gaining momentum [114]. This explains\
    \ the importance of remote sensing as a low-cost tool to\nimprove water management\
    \ in crops.\n5. Precision Water Management Strategies\nSeveral precision irrigation\
    \ technologies have been developed to improve crop productivity under\nwater-limited\
    \ conditions. However, appropriate precision irrigation strategies are equally\
    \ important for\nincreased efﬁciency and proﬁtability for site-speciﬁc technologies.\
    \ The development and application\nof management zones using spatial and temporal\
    \ information of various agronomic factors have\nbeen practiced for site-speciﬁc\
    \ management for several decades. In recent years, the use of artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ in prescription map development for site-speciﬁc water management is also increasing.\n\
    5.1. Management Zones\nVRI is often implemented in the ﬁeld by dividing it into\
    \ a number of sections, or management\nzones with the aim to save water and other\
    \ inputs together with yield optimization [25]. A management\nzone is a subﬁeld\
    \ area that is relatively homogeneous in soil and topographic attributes. The\
    \ use of\nmanagement zones can be a convenient means to capture the spatial distribution\
    \ of yield-inﬂuencing\nfactors within the season. The information on spatial and\
    \ temporal development of abiotic and\nbiotic stresses can be linked with site-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation systems via dynamic prescription maps\nto help producers improve\
    \ irrigation WUE, agricultural sustainability and the environment [102].\nVarious\
    \ factors such as soil properties, landscape attributes, crop properties, sensor-based\
    \ information,\nmanagement practice, weed, and pest management as well as crop\
    \ modeling have been considered\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n10 of 21\nin delineating\
    \ management zones for VRI application since several years [115]. Soil properties\
    \ such\nas soil organic matter, texture, nutrient content, pH, color, soil moisture\
    \ content and water-holding\ncapacities, ECa, etc. have been used effectively\
    \ in management zone delineation [116–119]. Landscape\nattributes such as elevation,\
    \ slope, aspect, curvature, and others have also been an important part\nof management\
    \ zone delineation in several studies [118,120–122]. Numerous studies have used\
    \ crop\nproperties such as yield maps and ground-based leaf area index to delineate\
    \ management zones\nfor VRI application [116,117,123,124]. The management zones\
    \ delineated based on yield data from\nmultiple years can effectively capture\
    \ nutrient variability in the ﬁeld [125]. However, the application of\nyield maps\
    \ for site-speciﬁc management can be challenging because spatial and temporal\
    \ variation in\nyield is affected by the interactions among several biotic and\
    \ abiotic factors [126,127]. Information from\nproximal and remote sensing such\
    \ as satellite and airborne imagery, normalized difference vegetation\nindex,\
    \ digital photography, etc. can be a powerful approach for delineation of relative\
    \ productive\nareas [128–131]. The zone information together with early season\
    \ environmental indicators and\ncrop response models can also be used to determine\
    \ the action decisions throughout the season [132].\nSimilarly, the selection\
    \ of factors for management zone delineation is equally important in management\n\
    zone delineation. A study was conducted to compare the site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ with conventional\nuniform irrigation management for potatoes in Idaho [25].\
    \ The available water-holding capacity of soil\nwas used to delineate a 2.9-ha\
    \ ﬁeld into nine management zones. The results showed that six out of\nnine management\
    \ zones produced a higher yield with site-speciﬁc management. However, the study\n\
    suggested that management zones were only based on available SWC and in some management\
    \ cases,\nother non-measured factors unrelated to soil texture or available water\
    \ content could have an impact\non the yield of crops. The study pointed out the\
    \ importance to take into consideration all the known\nfactors affecting yield\
    \ and include them in delineating irrigation management zones for site-speciﬁc\n\
    irrigation management. The optimum number of zones for a ﬁeld depends on the scale\
    \ of the ﬁeld,\neconomical and logistical practicality, and agronomic response\
    \ to irrigation amounts. For example,\nthe quantity and placement of soil moisture\
    \ sensors for determining irrigation amounts may vary\nwith ﬁeld size, cost of\
    \ the sensors and manageability, which, in turn, can inﬂuence the number of\n\
    management zones in the ﬁeld [133].\nThere are several methods to delineate management\
    \ zones, including unsupervised clustering,\nsupervised clustering, user-deﬁned\
    \ thresholds, etc. The clustering technique groups similar data\npoints into different\
    \ classes using algorithms such as k-means, fuzzy k-means, fuzzy c-means [127,134],\n\
    Ward′s method, and Jenk’s optimization procedure [125]. The appropriate factors\
    \ to be considered for\nmanagement zone delineation could be prioritized using\
    \ several methods such as principal component\nanalysis (PCA) [118]. It is equally\
    \ important to determine the number of optimum management\nzones for the ﬁeld\
    \ and their production and economic justiﬁcation [20]. A software program (MZA\n\
    software [135]) was developed for creating management zones using the fuzzy k-means\
    \ method.\nThis program determines the appropriate number of zones for a ﬁeld\
    \ by evaluating the clustering\nresults. Many studies have used management zones\
    \ for VRI and other site-speciﬁc crop management.\nFor example, a study conducted\
    \ in a 4.8-ha ﬁeld in Colorado assessed the effectiveness of ECa in\ncharacterizing\
    \ the spatial distribution of soil water [136]. This study found that SWC was\
    \ signiﬁcantly\ndifferent among different ECa derived management zones using MZA\
    \ software. This justiﬁes the\nimportance of characterizing management zones for\
    \ site-speciﬁc water management.\n5.2. Development of Site-Speciﬁc Water Management\
    \ Strategies\nTo enable the VRI technology in practice, the irrigation management\
    \ strategy is equally important.\nThe use of technology in the ﬁeld may not always\
    \ be effective in terms of ﬁnal yield or proﬁtability.\nFor example, research\
    \ has shown that the use of VRI technology may not be cost effective where\nthere\
    \ is high rainfall throughout the growing season [29]. Several strategies could\
    \ be applied to\nsave water and energy in the ﬁeld to gain yield beneﬁts in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Some of the strategies include\nskipping irritation in non-cropped areas,\
    \ planting different crops in the same ﬁeld, rainfall harvesting\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 87\n11 of 21\nin areas with high water-holding capacity, and lowering irrigation\
    \ to areas with low water use (ET) [46].\nNew irrigation strategies such as modifying\
    \ the current irrigation system for site-speciﬁc water and\nchemical applications\
    \ are required to sustain modern irrigated agricultural cropping systems [102].\n\
    Management strategies including placement and timing are crucial in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\nthroughout the growing season. About 9%−19% of irrigation water\
    \ savings were achieved with VRI\ncompared to the uniform application in a research\
    \ conducted in variable soil, which was possible\nwith several strategies such\
    \ as withholding irrigation during speciﬁc growth stages and in particular,\n\
    non-cropped areas of the ﬁeld [137]. Further, the study suggests that areas where\
    \ the optimized or\nincreased irrigation does not produce an increase in yield,\
    \ less water can be applied while the areas\nwith high yield potential can be\
    \ applied optimum irrigation and gain higher returns. A study showed\nthat restricting\
    \ irrigation during the peak water-demand time of cotton (80−100 days after planting)\n\
    from 100% to 60% of potential ET conserves 2.6 inches of water [138]. The VRI\
    \ trial was conducted\nin three farms in New Zealand to compare the VRI to uniform\
    \ rate irrigation (URI) [139]. The URI\ntreatments were provided with the same\
    \ level of irrigation at the same time as the most drought-prone\nsoil zone, but\
    \ VRI treatment was achieved by either delaying the irrigation or reducing the\
    \ amount\nand intensity of irrigation comparing to that with a drought-prone area.\
    \ The results showed that there\nwas a two to three-fold difference in total available\
    \ water-holding capacity at each site, which justiﬁed\nthe decision to use VRI\
    \ systems. Although the study found no signiﬁcant impact of VRI on crop yield,\n\
    water savings of 8 to 36% were achieved in three sites with less drainage. Hence,\
    \ critical management\nstrategies adopted in a decision support system that uses\
    \ real-time monitoring and feedback to\nirrigation control make water conversation\
    \ possible [28]. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is a complementary\nmethod that uses irrigation\
    \ scheduling at strategic times of less critical growth for irrigation water\n\
    conservation. In this method, irrigation is applied during the drought-sensitive\
    \ growth stages of a\ncrop. During less drought-sensitive stages, irrigation is\
    \ applied based on rainfall and availability of\nwater for maintenance [140].\n\
    The use of technology and strategies can also affect the level of proﬁt achieved\
    \ from the VRI\ntechnology itself. A study was conducted in a 20-ha wheat ﬁeld\
    \ in Southern Alberta, Canada on\nmodeling economic returns at different levels\
    \ of control [141]. A total of 62 management scenarios\nwere studied, including\
    \ (1) no irrigation, (2) uniform irrigation management, (3) speed control with\n\
    two angular increments of 2 and 10 degrees, and (4) zone control with a combination\
    \ of two angular\nincrements and a different number of independent irrigation\
    \ zones, ranging from 2 to 30. The study\nconcluded that the highest proﬁt was\
    \ obtained with 30 control zones. However, considering the cost\nof the technology,\
    \ the case of ten control zones along the central pivot system was found to be\
    \ the\nmost proﬁtable. Hence, it is essential to set forth effective site-speciﬁc\
    \ water management strategies for\nincreased agricultural sustainability and proﬁtability.\n\
    5.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nExisting site-speciﬁc management\
    \ utilizes several control strategies such mathematical modeling\nof crop yield\
    \ or the plant-soil-atmosphere environment, optimizing irrigation application\
    \ timing,\nlearning sensor feedback to control the site-speciﬁc ﬂow of water as\
    \ well as using predictive model\ncontrol that executes a model repeatedly to\
    \ determine optimum input. The use of artiﬁcial intelligence\nor neuro-dynamic\
    \ programming that integrates machine learning to determine the water application\n\
    parameter for optimized irrigation is also increasing [50,142–145]. Hyperspectral\
    \ remote sensing\nimaging along with machine learning has been in use in agricultural\
    \ industry, and it is estimated that\nmachine learning/deep learning-based classiﬁcation\
    \ has a signiﬁcant potential for high-dimensional\nbig data produced in agriculture\
    \ [146].\n6. Impact of Variable-Rate Irrigation\nVRI can be highly effective in\
    \ reducing water use and increasing water use efﬁciency (WUE) of\ncrops [147].\
    \ A review on VRI across different crop and weather regimes of the world concluded\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n12 of 21\nVRI could save 10%−15% of water [28].\
    \ A study in a 7-ha sugar beet ﬁeld in Germany reported that\n13% of water was\
    \ saved compared to the uniform application [15]. This was achieved by utilizing\n\
    stored soil moisture and in-season precipitation. In a study in New Zealand comparing\
    \ VRI with\nconventional irrigation system, 9%−19% irrigation water was saved\
    \ with VRI in pasture and corn\nﬁelds, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching\
    \ [137]. Similarly, the application of VRI by manipulating\nits several components\
    \ can reduce water runoff by avoiding excess water application in the ﬁeld [28].\n\
    At a large scale, water pumpage and use can be reduced by adopting VRI. A geospatial\
    \ method has\nbeen provided for potential VRI technology adopters to achieve potential\
    \ water savings in the ﬁeld\nusing freely available datasets such as soil survey\
    \ data from the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) [48]. In this study,\
    \ the difference in application depth between conventional irrigation\nand VRI\
    \ was estimated based on root zone available water capacity. The undepleted soil\
    \ water from\neach management zone was mined using prescription maps allowing\
    \ 50% depletion. VRI in this\nstudy resulted in a reduction in irrigation depth\
    \ of up to 18 mm, pumping reductions, and improved\nwater distribution throughout\
    \ the ﬁeld. In addition, higher VRI control resolution increased energy\nsavings.\
    \ VRI was found to reduce pumpage in more than 13% of center pivot irrigated ﬁelds\
    \ by 25 mm\nper year compared to the conventional irrigation system in Nebraska\
    \ [99]. Another study for VRI\nmanagement based on soil water spatial variation\
    \ was conducted in a 1.64-ha ﬁeld with center pivot to\nunderstand the yield and\
    \ water-saving effects of VRI [148]. In this study, the ﬁeld was divided into\
    \ four\nmanagement zones based on available water-holding capacity and each management\
    \ zone was further\ndivided into two sections for VRI and URI management. The\
    \ results from this study indicated that the\nimpact of VRI on water savings within\
    \ zones depended on weather conditions. Water savings with\nVRI management was\
    \ higher for summer maize when the rainfall was high compared to winter wheat\n\
    grown in no-rainfall weather. The study suggests that although VRI management\
    \ had no signiﬁcant\ninﬂuence on crop growth parameters and yield within a management\
    \ zone, managing the zones with\ndifferent available water-holding capacity might\
    \ improve the uniformity of crop growth, maximize\ncrop yield and gain potential\
    \ water savings.\nCompared to the uniform application, VRI increases crop productivity.\
    \ The results comparing\nthe water productivity of sorghum and corn showed that\
    \ there was more than 20% increase in water\nproductivity for both crops using\
    \ VRI [35]. Another study conducted in a 4-ha ﬁeld, VRI resulted in\na signiﬁcant\
    \ difference in corn yield in a dry year. However, the results were not signiﬁcant\
    \ for the\nyear when the rain was sufﬁcient [100]. Another study was conducted\
    \ in New Zealand to understand\nthe impact of variable-rate irrigation based on\
    \ soil moisture status [139]. This study showed that\nalthough the yield was not\
    \ signiﬁcantly different among different irrigation treatments, water savings\n\
    of 27–55 mm was achieved by limiting irrigation in soil with adequate plant available\
    \ water and\nnon-irrigating poorly drained, wet soil zones. VRI has been found\
    \ effective to reduce water and\nenergy use even in humid areas of the world with\
    \ uncertain and unpredictable rainfall [40]. This study\nshowed that potential\
    \ water savings of 20mm/year could be achieved using VRI in these regions.\nHowever,\
    \ the feasibility and effectiveness of VRI depend on the magnitude of the ﬁeld,\
    \ crop under\nconsideration, weather and the underlying ﬁeld properties [24,25,40].\
    \ The accurate determination of\nwater requirement and its management is crucial\
    \ for crop yield stabilization and improved average\nyield [53]. Several VRI research\
    \ projects attempt to enhance the control scenarios as well as model and\nproduction\
    \ function to improve water savings and reduce pumpage [40,99,141,149,150]. Further,\
    \ it is\nnecessary to understand the impact of soil water availability on crop\
    \ growth to manage irrigation in\nspatial and temporal scales using variable-rate\
    \ irrigation technologies and appropriate strategies.\n7. Challenges and Research\
    \ Requirements\nData collection and management tools, such as yield monitors,\
    \ sensors and sensing systems,\nGIS, GNSS, and decision support systems are available\
    \ today to enable site-speciﬁc management of\nirrigation water for optimized crop\
    \ production. Steady development in irrigation control systems\nprovides the user\
    \ with various options to implement VRI. Many studies have investigated and\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 87\n13 of 21\ndeveloped irrigation strategies, prescription\
    \ methodologies, and proﬁtability optimization involved in\nVRI. However, there\
    \ are some challenges in the implementation and application of this technology.\n\
    Further research and development are required to improve the understanding, implementation,\n\
    and adoption of precision water management strategies and technologies.\n(1)\n\
    Research is required on the integration of technology, agronomy, and proﬁtability\
    \ with VRI\nAlthough several studies have reported the potential of adopting VRI\
    \ system to optimize crop\nproduction and proﬁtability [29,70], some studies conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds have concluded\nthat the VRI technology may not be economically\
    \ viable for all crops under all growing conditions\nand environments [24]. This\
    \ is not because of the yield-related beneﬁt, but due to the cost of the\ntechnology\
    \ itself. For example, research conducted in a 12.6-ha ﬁeld in southwest Georgia\
    \ showed that\nVRI generated $16/ha more return than URI. Although this return\
    \ is not signiﬁcant for this small ﬁeld,\nthe study suggested that proﬁts could\
    \ be ampliﬁed for large ﬁelds and beneﬁt farmers [151]. From the\nagronomic perspective,\
    \ a better understanding of the extremities of ﬁeld variability and how it affects\n\
    crop yield is needed for the effective implementation of new technologies [152].\
    \ In an experiment\nconducted in Tennessee, the same level of irrigation did not\
    \ result in the same cotton lint yield in all\nparts of the ﬁeld due to differences\
    \ in texture and available water-holding capacity [153]. In some cases,\nthe incorporation\
    \ of other crops in a rotation in VRI can make this technology economically viable\
    \ [25].\nAdditionally, most of the VRI studies are concentrated on the control\
    \ scenarios of VRI [149,150].\nAlthough a few studies [40,99,141] determined water\
    \ and energy savings using VRI due to managerial\nlimitations, they were either\
    \ based on some model and production functions or arbitrary in irrigation\nrate\
    \ determination. Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive study on VRI integrating\
    \ the agronomic,\ntechnical and managerial aspects of VRI to determine its proﬁtability,\
    \ sustainability, and adoptability\nfor various conditions.\n(2)\nOn-farm and\
    \ whole-ﬁeld research\nProducers are more likely to adopt VRI if the beneﬁts are\
    \ shown on a “real farm.” Most of the\nprevious studies on VRI were conducted\
    \ in experimental ﬁelds or in small ﬁelds that cannot represent\nthe commercial\
    \ farming practice [28]. Experimental design and implementation in large ﬁelds\
    \ are\nchallenging. This type of research requires close communication and collaborative\
    \ management\nbetween the researcher and the farm owner to ensure the alignment\
    \ of management practices and study\ngoals. Acquiring data and information from\
    \ large ﬁelds is costly and time-consuming. In addition,\nthe statistical analysis\
    \ of on-farm data is challenging due to the lack of adequate tools that integrates\n\
    classical statistical methods and spatial analysis. This creates challenges in\
    \ the understanding of the\nrelationship between crop growth and its environment\
    \ in site-speciﬁc irrigation. More on-farm studies\nare needed to provide information\
    \ for practical VRI applications. In addition, insufﬁcient recognition\nof temporal\
    \ variation and environmental impact are several other factors that hinder the\
    \ adoption of\nprecision agriculture technology [9].\n(3)\nPrescription map development\n\
    The majority of previous studies for prescription maps (management zone delineation)\
    \ are for\nvariable-rate application of fertilizers and seeds and are static [20,133].\
    \ Limited research has addressed\nthe need for dynamic prescription map development\
    \ that could incorporate seasonal changes in\ncrop growth and conditions [133].\
    \ More research is required to evaluate VRI prescription maps or\nmanagement zone\
    \ development integrating different soil and crop characteristics under different\n\
    environments. Use of remote and proximal sensing such as infrared sensors, near-infrared\
    \ and thermal\nimages, along with weather data can provide information on crop,\
    \ soil, and environmental conditions\nin irrigation scheduling and developing\
    \ dynamic prescription maps [97]. Further research needs to\ninvestigate how to\
    \ integrate such data and information to evaluate the effectiveness of such prescription\n\
    maps during the growing season.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 87\n14 of 21\n(4)\nOptimal\
    \ spatial and temporal scale\nFew studies have evaluated the appropriate spatial\
    \ and temporal scales for VRI application.\nMany studies have explored the use\
    \ of sensors in acquiring information for modeling crop\nevapotranspiration, SWC,\
    \ irrigation needs including the nutrient requirements [97,105,152,154,155].\n\
    Most of these studies indicated the high potential of remote and proximal sensing\
    \ technologies in\nunderstanding spatial and temporal variations in crop growth\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld. Temporal\nvariability in soil water status and crop\
    \ growing conditions require dynamic adjustment of irrigation\namount and spatial\
    \ distribution. Therefore, simulation models or on-farm studies might be considered\n\
    to assess the effectiveness of VRI at different spatial and temporal scales.\n\
    (5)\nComprehensive decision support tools\nPrecision irrigation management requires\
    \ data and information from crop growth conditions,\nsoil physical and chemical\
    \ properties, weather factors, and the interaction among these factors.\nEffective\
    \ implementation of precision irrigation requires a comprehensive decision support\
    \ system to\nprocess and integrate different layers of data and information [48].\
    \ The challenge for the application\nof VRI still exists in the lack of user-friendly\
    \ decision support tools such as for developing dynamic\nprescription maps [105].\
    \ Several decision support systems such as AgriDSS are available [16,156],\nbut\
    \ producers are reluctant to use them to their full potential due to their complexity.\
    \ Also, these tools\nare based on what scientists and developers consider as necessary\
    \ knowledge that should be\nimplemented in the decision support system. However,\
    \ in a real-world situation, they fail to utilize\nthe implicit knowledge of farmers\
    \ and address their needs. The complexity, lack of observability and\nconﬁdence,\
    \ poor user interface design, lack of incentive to learn are some of the other\
    \ reasons behind\nthe hindrance of adoption of different decision support tools\
    \ [16]. The system or tool should help the\nuser decide where to apply how much\
    \ irrigation water at various crop growth stages to achieve the\nhighest proﬁt\
    \ based on the regional climate conditions and cropping systems.\n(6)\nIntegrating\
    \ VRI with other inputs\nFew studies have integrated variable-rate application\
    \ of nutrients with water. Crop yield response\nto water and N are not the same\
    \ at different parts of the ﬁeld [157], indicating the need for studying\nthe\
    \ interaction of water and fertilizer in variable-rate irrigation. Site-speciﬁc\
    \ application of N together\nwith irrigation using remote sensing can help reduce\
    \ N inputs by 50% and leaching by 85% without\nreducing yields [155]. Further\
    \ studies are needed to investigate the interaction between VRI fertilizers\n\
    and other inputs to improve the efﬁciencies of water and fertilizers while reducing\
    \ the environmental\nimpact of fertilizer application and enhancing production\
    \ sustainability.\nAuthor Contributions: The authors contributed equally to the\

    Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is the capacity to spatially vary the depth of
    water application in a field to handle different types of soils, crops, and other
    conditions. Precise management zones must be developed to efficiently apply variable
    rate technologies. However, there is no universal method to determine management
    zones. Using speed control maps for the central pivot is one option. Thus, this
    study aims to develop an intelligent fuzzy inference system based on precision
    irrigation knowledge, i.e., a system that can create prescriptive maps to control
    the rotation speed of the central pivot. Satellite images are used in this study
    because remote sensing offers quick measurements and easy access to information
    on crops for large irrigation areas. Based on the VRI-prescribed map created using
    the intelligent decision-making system, the pivot can increase or decrease its
    speed, reaching the desired depth of application in a certain irrigation zone.
    Therefore, considering the spatial variability in the crop has made the strategy
    of speed control more realistic than traditional methods for crop management.
    The intelligent irrigation system pointed out areas with lower leaf development,
    indicating that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water layer
    applied to that area. The existence of well-divided zones could be observed; each
    zone provides a specific value for the speed that the pivot must develop for decreasing
    or increasing the application of the water layer to the crop area. Three quarters
    of the total crop area had spatial variations during water application. The set
    point built by the developed system pointed out zones with a decreased speed in
    the order of 50%. From the viewpoint of a traditional control, the relay from
    pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70% to 35% whenever the central
    pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed system obtained values of 37%
    and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore, it is possible to affirm
    that traditional control models used for central-pivot irrigators do not support
    the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed control determined by the
    developed VRI systems. Results indicate that data from the edaphoclimatic variables
    when well-fitted to the fuzzy logic can solve uncertainties and non-linearities
    of an irrigation system and establish a control model for high-precision irrigation.

    rate irrigationSpeed controlRemote sensingDecision support system 1. Introduction
    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that
    to meet food demands in 2050 agriculture production must at least double or triple
    in the next 40 years, and 80% of this increase must come from increasing the production.
    Considering the limited resources of our planet, reaching this goal will be challenging
    (FAO, 2016). The adoption of irrigated agriculture enables increased productivity
    and the production of several crops (Borghetti, Silva, Nocko, Loyola, & Chianca,
    2017). However, with the growing limitation of water resources, the use of water
    in agriculture must be more efficient to maintain the current levels of productivity
    in conjunction with the expansion of irrigated areas. Decisions for irrigation
    management require taking into consideration inter-related economic, physical,
    and biological variables, which are frequently difficult to foresee and over which
    there is little or no control (Herrera, Ibeas, & de la Sen, 2013). The decade-long
    search for automated solutions to improve agricultural application for more efficient
    use (Evans and King, 2012, Gilley et al., 1983, Omary et al., 1997, Sadler et
    al., 1996) has resulted in the introduction of several solutions for agricultural
    inputs to conduct water application with spatial correction. Irrigation systems
    that operate using variable rate water application are required for a spatial
    water management to increase crop efficiency (Armindo, Botrel, & Garzella, 2011).
    Decision support systems for irrigation and water conservation are used intensely
    for minimizing water application and maximizing yield. However, the numerical
    optimization of irrigation systems is computer-intensive and often requires simplification
    and discretization of the model (Dogan et al., 2010, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016).
    Furthermore, sensorial system and model integration do not reflect the natural
    flow of the environment (Voinov & Shugart, 2013), creating significant limitations
    in performance. Control systems also do not reflect or satisfy the requirements
    of the final users due to the lack of domain knowledge capture (McIntosh et al.,
    2011). The use of advanced control techniques is a promising possibility. Literature
    shows that these tools can significantly improve irrigation systems and efficient
    use of water resources (McCarthy et al., 2013, Romero et al., 2012). The final
    challenge of an environmental and agricultural support system is to overcome the
    uncertainty related to data quality and difficulties in remote sensing of large
    areas (Dutta et al., 2014, McCarthy et al., 2013). Moreover, the inter-related
    economic, physical, and biological variables are multi-attributed vaguely and
    in subjective terms. A neat approach to deal with such uncertain situations is
    found in the fuzzy set theory, which has now reached a mature state for expansion
    and application. Zadeh''s paper “Fuzzy Sets” was published in 1965; since then,
    the theory of fuzzy sets has been used for writing more realistic decision support
    models. Fuzzy logic can analyze the imprecise information and is efficient in
    decision-making for vague and uncertain phenomena (Kweon, 2012). Specialized systems
    that used fuzzy logic in its inception have been successfully applied to problems
    concerning decision, control, diagnose, and classification (Castillo & Melin,
    2008) because they are capable of managing intrinsic complex reasoning in an application
    area. In agriculture, the interface of these systems allows a natural and straightforward
    use, as a planning tool for the manager and farmer. In irrigation systems, the
    interaction between components is not always accurately defined. Fuzzy logic can
    be used in such systems for extracting inferences from an inaccurate input and
    for solving problems in this area (Thangavadivelu & Colvin, 1997). An irrigation
    system based on the fuzzy logic with simple rules is more attractive to most farmers
    (Bahat, Inbar, Yaniv, & Schneider, 2000) since these systems do not require a
    precise measurement or a precise model, which may be very complicated and require
    considerable funds, resources and development time. This study is based on the
    premise that irrigation problems do not require precise measures. The support
    system to the fuzzy decision is considered useful due to its interactive nature
    and flexible approach (Kumar and Rajkumar, 2014, Raju and Kumar, 2005); therefore,
    the integration of fuzzy logic and irrigation planning issues in the field is
    very effective. Herein, several control techniques for VRI have been presented,
    of which some use fuzzy inference and neural networks for setting the amount of
    water required for irrigation (Bing et al., 2015, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli,
    2015, Papadopoulos et al., 2011, Papageorgiou et al., 2016). Other techniques
    focus on determining when to irrigate and instruments that show spatial differences
    among sectors in the same crop area (Montalvo et al., 2013, Omid et al., 2010,
    Rafea et al., 2003). However, all the techniques mentioned do not present control
    maps for the central pivot, as proposed herein. The problem examined herein is
    part of the crop production domain, approaching the issue of necessary decision-making
    for precision irrigation. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop
    a fuzzy inference system that decides when to increase or decrease the speed of
    the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field and using

    was developed by following the structure shown in Fig. 1. The structure of the
    proposed system allows the elaboration of the management map in a systematic,
    autonomous, and automatized way to control the irrigation system. The commercial
    systems used more frequently by farmers still cannot draw such a control map using
    the proposed technique. Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download :

    vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy temperature Vegetation indexes generated from
    the data gathered by remote sensing constitute an important tool for monitoring
    natural or anthropogenic changes in the use and coverage of the land. These indexes
    have been used to estimate several vegetation patterns, such as leaf area index
    and green biomass quantity, as well as in the evaluation of soil use and the maintenance
    and recovery of degraded areas (Okin, 2007). Information from satellite images
    and values from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) reading, which
    is an essential parameter for irrigation maintenance, were used and adjusted according
    to local conditions. Irrigation management through the plant shows the complexity
    inherent to the visualization of the symptoms of water deficit, which are difficult
    to detect. In certain occasions, problems are discovered when it is too late,
    i.e., when their effects have already compromised the production and quality of
    the product. Usually, these symptoms are related to the color tone of leaves,
    leaf curling, and leaf angle. However, a correlation between NDVI values and the
    basal crop coefficient (Kc) (Hunsaker, Barnes, Clarke, Fitzgerald, & Pinter, 2005;
    and Kamble, Kilic, & Hubbard, 2013) can be established since a strong correlation
    exists between estimated Kc (KcNDVI) and observed Kc (Allen, Pereira, Raes, &
    Smith, 1998/FAO-56) in corn and soy crops for guiding irrigation times in the
    season. The use of canopy temperature and infrared thermometry is another way
    to relate to the development of the crop through remote sensing. A plant under
    water stress has decreased transpiration and would typically show a higher temperature
    than a plant that is not under stress (Bellvert, Zarco-Tejada, Girona, & Fereres,
    2014), a trait that could be used as a powerful tool to monitor and quantify water
    stress. Canopy temperature increases when solar radiation is absorbed (Idso &
    Baker, 1967), but it cools down when the latent energy or transpiration is used
    for evaporating water instead of cooling plant surfaces. Further, algorithms based
    on canopy temperature are strongly correlated with quantifiable results from crops
    (Colaizzi, O''Shaughnessy, Evett, & Howell, 2012), such as yield, water efficiency
    use, seasonal evapotranspiration, leaf water potential at noon, irrigation rates,
    and damage caused by herbicides. 2.2. Satellite imagery The Intelligent Environmental
    Knowledgeable system (i-ekbase)1 is an autonomous big data analytics engine running
    a CLOUD system. i-ekbase is an easy-to-use fully automated geographic information
    system (GIS). It primarily focuses on precision agricultural and biodiversity
    monitoring applications, automatically integrating data from various satellites
    with local weather data, farmers’ knowledge, and applying Machine Learning techniques
    to create a data-driven future for global agriculture (Dutta et al., 2014). Fig.

    for capturing timely remote sensing imagery on the study site using Landsat (with
    a spatial resolution of 15 m) and Sentinel (with a spatial resolution of 10 m)
    satellites. Data were captured for 12 months for developing the experimental system.
    Data that compose this image have over 14 thousand geo-referential points, which
    indicate a raster type structure, containing in each point or pixel that attributes

    the web tool i-ekbase (Table 1), the information is pre-processed to filter the
    data that are not required by the decision-making system. Thus, only canopy temperature,

    29.58 Source: adapted from the i-ekbase system (2017). For applying this approach
    on a commercial scale, remote sensing data required to describe the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relation can be acquired from satellite images (Moran, Inoue, & Barnes, 1997)
    and airplanes (Fitzgerald et al., 2006, Wood et al., 2003). However, high costs,
    spatial resolution, data frequency and data availability (Pinter et al., 2003,
    Trout et al., 2008), as well as satellite cloudless images (Barker, Heeren, Neale,
    & Rudnick, 2018) are challenges for the correct execution of models based on remote
    sensing; these factors can limit the efficiency of VRI management in real time.
    Remote sensing data that accurately describe the soil–plant–atmosphere relationship
    was selected for the intelligent irrigation system at the crop location. In this
    stage, accurately choosing the best data is fundamental to ensure that the results
    are calculated correctly. A simple but promising approach uses culture coefficients
    from normalized differentiated variation indexes, combined with local climate
    data, to assume the amount of ETc (evapotranspiration) of variable crops almost
    at real time (Er-Raki et al., 2007, González-Dugo and Mateos, 2008, Hunsaker et
    al., 2005). With some consideration of the daily meteorological conditions, models
    based on remote sensing can be used in studies of water relations (Barker et al.,
    2018) in the soil–plant–atmosphere system and could become an easy-to-use and
    fast response tool. Canopy temperature is also an important parameter to manage
    irrigation and must be adjusted according to local crop conditions. From the location
    selected for cultivation and the type of crop to be irrigated, in relation to
    the data linked to the type of plant, a crop coefficient will be used together
    with information from satellite images. In this case, NDVI reading, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature values will be used. 2.3. Crop area The
    crop area is a farm at Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil, latitude
    15°14′24.73′′S and longitude 54°0′53.29′′W. This area contains several crops,
    such as soy, cotton, and “safrinha” corn, irrigated by a central pivot. The delimited
    area is 140 ha, with a radius of 667 m (see Fig. 3). The area delimited by the
    red circle is irrigated with a central pivot, and the information used in this
    study is for a cultivation cycle of “safrinha” corn in 2015/2016. To irrigate
    “safrinha” corn means to provide minimum water conditions for the development
    of the crop. Corn is highly sensitive to drought. Therefore, the occurrence of
    a period of lower water intake by plants in critical moments for the development
    of the crop, from flowering to physiological maturation, can lead to the lower
    yield. For maximum yield, corn plantation needs approximately 650 mm of water
    (Bergamaschi et al., 2001) during its cycle, which varies from 110 to 140 days
    in hybrids with an average cycle. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    during growth. After analyzing the NDVI values contained in Fig. 4, the similarity
    among values attributed to crop coefficient (Kc) can be verified (Hunsaker et
    al., 2005; and Kamble et al., 2013). As the crop develops, the leaf area increases,
    which makes it possible to establish a NDVI relationship. Download : Download

    in a crop cycle. Source: Author''s archives. This process is also described by
    Hunsaker et al. (2005), with relations for calculating the basal crop coefficient
    (Kcb) for cotton as a function of NDVI. When each of the development phases of
    the crop is analyzed, two distinct areas are evident: one with little growth and
    another with average growth. From this differentiation, it is possible to build
    a water demand map as well as speed control maps. For the preliminary analysis,
    the daily average precipitation data made available by National Institute of Meteorology2
    (INMET) were used. Data were collected from April to September 2016 in the municipality
    of Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. Fig. 5 illustrates the obtained
    data. Finally, precipitation readings recorded during the development of the crop
    under study corroborate with the premise of water stress due to the lack of rain,
    which would indicate the possibility of complementing the water demand with irrigation.

    Monitoring System. 2.4. Fuzzy systems Over the last 20 years, fuzzy systems have
    attracted considerable attention and have met great applicability in the agricultural
    domain, helping farmers to make the right decisions for their crops (Papageorgiou
    et al., 2016). For example, Bahat et al. (2000) proposed a solution for an irrigation
    controller based on the fuzzy logic methodology with simple rules, making the
    system more attractive for farmers. Raj and Kumar (2005) observed that the integration
    of fuzzy logic and real-world irrigation planning problems are very useful, particularly
    with multiple specialists in a subjective data environment. Upon using fuzzy systems
    for decision-making concerning irrigation, Zhang, Fei, Wei, Congcong, and Yuewei
    (2011) reported that fuzzy logic does not require all the relevant information
    for solving the problem of water in irrigation. Bing, Huifeng, and Xia (2015)
    developed a fuzzy system of decision-making for solving uncertainties and non-linearity
    of the irrigation system, and the model showed high precision. The system of fuzzy
    inference proposed by Almeida, Vieira, Marques, Kiperstok, and Cardoso (2013),
    in turn, provided a conceptual approach based on the multi-criteria decision-making
    process. This approach relates water use to environmental factors, such as drought,
    water exploration index, water use, population density, and wastewater treatment
    index, resulting in warnings about future water supply. Irrigation based on the
    fuzzy inference system presents better results than traditional methods. The fuzzy
    system will be used to infer the variations in the linear movement speed of the
    pivot according to satellite images. An intelligent system was developed, manipulating
    various data-driven approaches to create a control map. Due to the nature of the
    management of the study area, fuzzy systems are used herein to aid irrigation
    decision-making. Because a farmer''s decisions are purely intuitive and knowledge-based
    gained over years of work, we chose not to describe the way the farm works explicitly.
    Another critical piece in the farmer''s routine was that the pivot utilized extensive
    amount of time to perform a full turn. However, the central pivot irrigation system
    should operate 21 h a day, with 3 h for maintenance because high electricity prices
    are charged by the utility. Three input variables were used (NDVI, upper layer
    soil moisture, and canopy temperature) to infer the speed, which the central pivot
    has to reach to improve the irrigation level within the crop area, and to find
    an adequate speed for the pivot movement in relation to the amount of water coming
    out of the sprinklers. Futhermore, a decision unit or inference machine is implemented
    using the Mamdani method to conduct the rule-based inference operations with crisp
    input and crisp output. Mamdani fuzzy systems use fuzzy sets as a consequent rule;
    therefore, the inference method for a set of conjunctive rules for the rth rule
    will be given by the following condition: (1) Within the objective proposed for
    the developed system, once linguistic variables are applied to the output of fuzzy
    inference systems, it becomes fitter for modeling the human reflection process.
    By doing so, the interface of the system becomes more straightforward and natural.
    In the first stage of development, the water layer provided by the irrigation
    system is considered constant. The database that defines the association functions
    of sets used in the fuzzy rules is implemented according to Table 3 and Fig. 6.

    to each system input. Source: Author''s archives. Remote sensing data allow building
    the universe of discourse for each input variable and therefore change the database
    into linguistic variables, as shown in Table 3. Each input was previously limited
    to the discourse universe in question and associated to the grade of membership
    in each fuzzy set through specialized knowledge. Therefore, to obtain the grade
    of membership of a certain crisp input, one must search for this value in the
    fuzzy system knowledge. The fuzzification of the decision-making system in Fig.
    6 helps to visualize the corresponding membership functions, considering these
    intervals as the discourse universe of the variables. Triangular membership functions
    were chosen because they simplify the calculation of the fuzzy inference mechanism
    and couple to the fuzzy rules IF-THEN (Wang, 1997). Well distributed triangular
    membership functions change input data into fuzzy values (low, average, and high),
    as shown in Fig. 6a, as well as values for soil moist and NDVI (Fig. 6b and c,
    respectively). Fuzzy outputs, which represent the rotation speed of the central
    pivot, were built from five linguistic variables: very low (MB), low (B), normal
    (N), high (A), and very high (MA). All the sets were interpreted based on their
    membership functions, as shown in Fig. 7. Several defuzzification methods have
    been proposed (Dubois & Prade, 2000), of which CENTROID (area center or center
    of gravity) is more widely used. For this method, a clear value of the output
    variable is calculated by finding the variable for the center of gravity of the
    association function for the fuzzy value (Jang, Sun, & Mizutani, 1997) as follows:
    (2) where uout(ui) is the area of a grade of membership modified by the fuzzy
    inference result and ui is the position of the centroid of the individual membership
    functions. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size

    defuzzification. Membership functions (Velocity). Source: Author''s archives.
    Finally, the fuzzy rule relating to rotation speed contains 27 rules, as summarized
    in Table 3. Therefore, the reading of the first line, for example, is IF NDVI
    = Low AND Canopy Temperature = Low AND Soil Moisture = Low THEN Rotation Speed = Low.
    This set of rules is based on basic knowledge of irrigation, according to the
    methodology adopted in Bernardo, Soares, and Mantovani (2006) and Silva and Azevedo
    (1998). The rules were elaborated with the connective “AND” and are based on the
    premise that little leaf growth is due to water deficit in the soil (Boyer, 1968,
    Hsiao, 1973, Wright, 1977) along with high canopy temperature, which indicates
    low evapotranspiration, in other words, plants under water stress. Values of moisture
    close to the soil given by the web tool are local readings of spots with fewer
    leaves, making it possible to estimate its value. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Control maps for pivot rotation speed For mapping the speed control system herein,
    eight crop areas were stipulated with a level of ambiguity regarding the impact
    of the variable application rate (Feinerman & Voet, 2000), given that an increase
    in the flexibility of input application through field subdivision in a higher
    number of management unities did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the total
    (optimal) water use. The images showing different growth stages of the plantation
    were analyzed. The development stage [Kc-Development] was the one that presented
    the highest water stress in different planted areas, as shown in Table 5. Furthermore,
    performing the analysis of critical point was essential to demonstrate the applicability
    of fuzzy systems to create the control maps. Table 5. Analysis of the best dates

    The information extracted after pre-processing remote sensing data was NDVI, canopy
    temperature, and upper layer soil moisture. These values are the input data set
    for the fuzzy system, which is capable of inferring percentages for the central
    pivot rotation speed motion. The case study corresponds to the sampling of two
    readings obtained from different dates of the crop cycle: the first on June 15,
    2016 and the second on June 28, 2016. 3.2. Case study on June 15th, 2016 The input
    set for the intelligent fuzzy system is the analyzed and processed data on canopy
    temperature, moisture close to the soil, and NDVI (see Table 2) illustrated in
    Fig. 8a–c. The input, as shown in Fig. 8, was organized according to the linguistic
    variables of the fuzzy system and separated by tones for better visualization.
    Due to the nature of the central pivot speed control equipment, the output given
    by the fuzzy system was in percentage values. The per centimeter, which was responsible
    for rotational speed control, used only the reference percentage of rotation in
    relation to the time of 60 s. Thus, for the values of 50% (represented in orange
    in Fig. 9), the control made the pivot stay in operation for 30 s and off for
    30 s. The intelligent system obtained the result shown in Fig. 9, which illustrates
    different regions within the area, with different values for the pivot rotation
    speed. Download : Download high-res image (934KB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 9. Output data for the fuzzy inference system: rotation speed of the central
    pivot. Source: Author''s archives. Analysis of the input data identified the existence
    of two broad areas with lower leaf development, which could indicate a lack of
    water for development. After processing input data, the intelligent irrigation
    system showed these areas of lower leaf development in a more intense red tone.
    This indicates that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water
    layer in that specific location, because the rotation speed of the pivot determines
    the level of the water layer applied. A thinner water layer is applied with higher
    speed and a higher application of water in the soil occurs with lower rotation
    speed (Valín, Cameira, Teodoro, & Pereira, 2012). The expected result was the
    creation of control maps; in this case, it was possible to determine the reference
    speed values for eight initially programmed zones, as shown in Fig. 10. Moreover,
    areas that present different colors in Fig. 9 are shown in the control map result,
    which illustrates the existence of well-divided zones. In each one, a specific
    value is observed for the speed that the pivot must reach to increase or decrease
    the water layer in the crop area. Download : Download high-res image (181KB) Download

    for interpretation. The intelligent system of irrigation obtained the result shown
    in Fig. 12, which illustrates different regions within the crop area with different
    values of pivot rotation. A higher rotation speed implies the application of a
    thinner water layer, and a lower rotation speed leads to more water application
    in the soil, given that the application flow is kept constant in the sprinklers.

    and canopy temperature are essential for the decision-making process of the intelligent
    irrigation system. The large areas with a lower leaf development could indicate
    a lack of water for development. In the case of the output of the intelligent
    irrigation system, more intense red areas indicate that the pivot must reduce
    its speed. In this study, the reference values of the rotation speed of the pivot
    for the eight initially programmed zones of irrigation were determined, as shown
    in Fig. 13. In this result, the areas with different colors in Fig. 12 are the
    result of the control map constructed and are shown in Fig. 13. Irrigation zones
    were well divided, which makes it is possible to see an absolute value for the
    rotation speed of each pivot, increasing and decreasing the water layer applied
    to the cultivation area. The result shown in Fig. 13b corresponds to reference
    values to be sent to the pivot controller. Download : Download high-res image

    fuzzy system for irrigation control is original and innovative. No similar discussion
    in the scientific literature about speed control maps of the central pivot was
    found. Furthermore, there is no information available on commercial systems that
    can autonomously build this type of map. Experiments demonstrated the potential
    effectiveness of the pivot operation based on the differences between velocities
    by management zones. The system follows the definition of VRI; once the speed
    changes, there are changes in the amount of supplied water. In this context, fuzzy
    logic can be applied widely in agricultural areas; therefore, a decision support
    system can be build that has the knowledge of precision irrigation. The implementation
    of fuzzy logic decision support system was successful to develop prescription
    maps for VRI with central pivots. However, a broader and commercial application
    will depend on the integration of data collection systems, management strategies,
    and hardware control. In other words, the fuzzy logic model performed as expected,
    providing excellent results. However, the reliability of data sources (NDVI, surface
    soil water, and canopy temperature) to develop a reliable prescription map is
    the scope of future study. The future study will focus on the field implementations
    and determine whether any additional data (different types of data, high-quality
    data, and/or more frequent data) will be required for developing the map. In this
    analysis, the rotation speed control extracted through inference does not consider
    the volume of the water layer to be applied. The interpretation given by the fuzzy
    system is as follows: where there is variation in the plant growth, there will
    be variation in water demand. To solve this, more data should be collected to
    validate the system for various scenarios in near future. The results were favorable
    to the continuity of studies on precision irrigation and application of the fuzzy
    logic for creating central pivots irrigation systems maps. Future research should
    implement this decision support system into field trials to evaluate its ability
    to reduce irrigation pumping and/or improve crop yield. Contributorship statement

  analysis: This review paper presents regenerative agriculture and integrative permaculture
    as alternatives to the unsustainable practices exhibited by modern agriculture
    and the Green Revolution. The proposed alternatives focus on reducing or eliminating
    the use of agrochemicals and machineries, restoring soil quality, biodiversity,
    and ecosystem services, and ultimately improving global food security. Further,
    these alternative practices, when combined with smart technology and data science,
    can create a more sustainable food production system. Specifically, digital agriculture,
    sustainable agricultural management, and modern agricultural technologies infused
    with data science (AI or ML) are critical for identifying and implementing practices
    towards regenerative agriculture, integrated permaculture, and digital agriculture.

    A growing world population and increases in food and energy consumption have placed
    production agriculture in a difficult situation. The rapid growth in food production
    through specialized operations such as monoculture cropping systems has aligned
    to satisfy increases in demand for food and fiber. However, its adverse impacts
    on natural resources pose huge challenges for the sustainability of food production.
    The situation is direr for developing countries or rural regions of the world
    due to the limited resources available to farming communities in these regions.
    To avoid production agriculture being at the proverbial crossroads we suggest
    an alternate approach. One that involves the sustainable use of natural resources
    without adverse environmental impacts by relying less on production inputs whether
    it be agrochemicals or machineries. We examined the extent to which regenerative
    agriculture, permaculture, and smart technology have evolved in response to sustainable
    agricultural production, agricultural decision support system, and overall global
    food security. Collectively, regenerative agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed
    holistic systems approach designed to reduce or eliminate dependence on external
    inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil
    quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services). We suggest that fully embracing

    network 1 INTRODUCTION For much of the last couple of decades, two simultaneous
    trends with potentials to compromise social, economic, and environmental sustainability
    have been receiving widespread attention, that is, global population and agriculture
    production. The world''s population continues to grow adding an estimated 83 million
    people per year with projections to reach an estimated 9.7 billion in 2050 with
    a vast contribution from developing countries (United Nations, 2019). Agricultural
    production increased concomitantly to meet increased global demand for food, fiber,
    and energy from surging world population along with rising incomes and abilities
    to purchase more. Even though the objectives of agricultural production systems
    have broadened, and have diversified, an ultimate goal of sustainable food security
    remains. The critical question that keeps arising is whether agricultural production
    systems especially in developing countries can continue to meet their goals sustainably
    or not. Alexandratos (1999), for example, argues that for any agricultural practices
    to be sustainable, meeting the food and fiber needs of the present population,
    should in no way compromise either the food security or the economic, social,
    and environmental elements used in the process for future generations. The need
    for greater food productivity has been satisfied in parts, while it became more
    than double over the last number of years through monoculture. This monoculture
    can be explained as a cropping system model emphasizing specialization and productive
    efficiency, that has largely guided modern agriculture (Asbjornsen et al., 2014;
    Tilman et al., 2002). Tied in with such intensive industrial food production was
    another agricultural farming practice, which in itself was revolutionary. Known
    as the Green Revolution, food production from these agricultural systems resulted
    in remarkable growth (Pingali, 2012). In consolidation with new technologies,
    high-yielding genetically modified crop varieties, agrochemicals (inorganic fertilizers,
    pesticides) and controlled water supply contributed to large increases in crop
    productivity. Undoubtedly, both the green revolution and monoculture cropping
    systems presented clear benefits. Economies of scale has contributed considerably
    to farms’ economic performance through improved production efficiencies and lower
    production costs. This in turn has led to numerous opportunities for agricultural
    producers to not only feed an increasing world population, but simultaneously
    improve human health and nutrition through the delivery of specialized nutrient-rich
    crops and animal products (Bouis & Saltzman, 2017). At the field level, the many
    benefits of specialized mono-cropping systems to meet the vast new demand opportunities
    supplying large quantities of food and energy have been extensively reported (Dai
    & Dong, 2014; Meng et al., 2013; Tilman et al., 2002). Currently, these benefits
    and gains in many instances have either been lost or diminished because of the
    inability to balance the advantages and disadvantages. These specialized cropping
    systems due to their strong reliance on external inputs have raised present and
    future challenges to the sustainable use of our natural resources. Modern agriculture
    therefore does have serious implications for sustainability and requires judicious
    management strategy moving forward. Modern agriculture practices have resulted
    in adverse unintended consequences detrimental to environmental quality and sustainability
    (Power, 2010). Further, the pursuit of monoculture benefits has been disproportional
    as the negative consequences are particularly more serious in developing countries.
    Environmental and ecological problems such as land degradation (Diacono & Montemurro,
    2010), loss of biodiversity (Isbell et al., 2017; Nicholls & Altieri, 2013) and
    water pollution (Sebilo et al., 2013) have disproportionally affected and simultaneously
    revealed the vulnerabilities of poorer communities or farmers with limited resources
    in developing countries (Pretty & Bharucha, 2014) (Figure 1). Core Ideas  Intensive
    agriculture can cause a loss in biodiversity and concerns for global food security.  Regenerative
    agriculture and integrative permaculture are keys to address food security.  Digital
    agricultural tools can aid in attaining agricultural and environmental sustainability.  Precision
    agriculture should be implemented as an agricultural decision support system.  Artificial
    intelligence and machine learning can guide integrated agricultural input management.
    FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer Flow chart showing the targets to achieve agricultural
    sustainability through integrative permaculture and regenerative agriculture using
    modern agricultural tools to attain global food security Opposite to monoculture,
    permaculture is regarded as a farming system that uses conventional practices
    coupled with new approaches that combine natural, ecological, and economic factors
    into the monoculture production system (Figure 1). Permaculture is considered
    an umbrella term that describes a broad range of practices and systems to optimize
    the interactions between the soil–plant systems. It efficiently utilizes various
    ecological functionalities to maximize both ecosystem health and providing a broad
    suite of ecosystem services (Gambiza, 2019). The ethos of permaculture is not
    only the efficient functioning of natural systems but for activities that work
    in tandem and embodies human health and well-being. It embraces a few principles
    and ethics to promote sustainable agricultural production which in turn promotes
    diverse and resilient agroecosystems (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014; Fiebrig et al.,
    2020). Permaculture can also be broken down into individual aspects composed of
    different elements or measures addressing each aspect of agricultural production
    but collectively it can remediate the problems of present-day agriculture. For
    instance, the first strategy tackles biodiversity, the second focuses on interactions,
    the third combines creativity and innovations, and the fourth embraces adaptive
    management (Ferguson & Lovell,  2014). The underlying principles of permaculture
    as a major driver in sustaining rural economies and cultures have long existed
    and are similar to multifunctional agriculture (Marsden & Sonnino, 2008). Permaculture
    has always been about the whole system''s design, a fundamental principle that
    all components of a system are interrelated (Ferguson & Lovell, 2014). Recently,
    modifications and a shift in notions took place to leverage advancements in agronomic
    and animal husbandry operationalization that also consider societal and ethical
    aspects (Akhtar et al., 2016; Ingram, 2018; Thrall et al., 2010). To some extent,
    modern agriculture has ignored the associations on the whole-farm level focusing
    solely on inputs or factors of production (e.g., pesticides, fertilizers). Permaculture
    views many of the various farming activities as being co-independent. For example,
    permaculture advocates for farmers to consider pests or weeds when making fertilizer
    decisions (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Similarly, permaculture encourages crop rotation
    that involves more than two crops where such numbers provide the best solutions
    for maintaining soil fertility and improving soil moisture, control pests, or
    provide pollination services (Asbjornsen et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2010). A
    few recent studies have reported the role of permaculture in creating resilient
    and productive landscapes and communities (Aznar-Sánchez et al., 2019; Ferguson
    & Lovell, 2014) (Figure 1). Evidence from these studies suggests that permaculture
    is not entirely a new concept but one which has grown over time (Ferguson & Lovell,
    2014). We conceptualized and evaluated scenarios of problems and disadvantages
    associated with monoculture, summarized the benefits of permaculture to overall
    ecosystem services, evaluated implications of regenerative modern agriculture,
    and integrated permaculture to achieve global food security. This perspective
    suggests that the incorporation of modern agricultural technologies and integration
    of data science artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with agricultural
    resource management will help address global food security challenges. Future
    research works should be tailored to adopt a more holistic input efficient, resilient,
    regenerative-based production system, and output-based system to optimize agricultural
    production while reducing the environmental footprint. 2 MONOCULTURE CROPPING
    SYSTEMS: BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES Monoculture plays a key role in land degradation
    (Pacheco et al., 2018) which over time develops into a myriad of other environmental
    (e.g., reduction in land productivity, soil erosion, water quality deterioration,
    loss of biodiversity, and dysfunctionality of ecosystem etc.) problems (Figure
    1). As monoculture activities continue to intensify, soil and water erosion and
    fertility loss are directly affecting the quality and productivity of soil health
    (Crews et al., 2018). Approximately 17% of otherwise fertile vegetative land has
    been degraded and rendered unproductive due to anthropogenic activities (Tilman
    et al., 2002). It has also been reported recently that such loss represents a
    minimum of 3% of global agricultural gross domestic product (Baskan et al., 2017).
    Due to intensive cultivation, deforestation, climate change, and farming marginal
    lands, developing countries are most likely to suffer high erosion rates which
    are generally accompanied by reductions in the provisioning of ecosystem services
    (Labrière et al., 2015). As per recent FAO interpretation, the situation will
    more likely become worse in the absence of meaningful interventions (FAO, 2015).
    Thus, soil preservation and quality are considered as critical factors in supporting
    agroecosystem services to address current and future food security concerns. Top
    soil constitutes the majority of organic matter and more than half of the essential
    primary available nutrients of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)
    needed for plant growth and productivity (Brady & Weill, 2010). Soils affected
    by high erosion rates and the associated removal of their top soils are therefore
    subjected to large nutrient loss and decreased soil fertility. Long-term expansion
    of natural ecosystems to row crop agriculture and intense use of agrochemicals
    (fertilizer and pesticides) is therefore not only a major threat to soil fertility
    but have caused contamination of ground and surface water. There have been numerous
    examples of agricultural contributions to water pollution (Dodds et al., 2009;
    Foy & Kirk, 1995). Mitigation efforts are therefore badly needed to abate the
    present situation. Controlling nutrient transfer from farmland depends on both
    a reduction in inputs use, as well as how they are managed to reduce mobilization
    (Goulding et al., 2008). Land degradation and climate change are inextricably
    linked as intensive farming practices such as conventional tillage, forest clearing,
    biomass burning, excessive use of inorganic fertilizer, etc., have been a major
    contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions (Grace et al., 2011; Lacanne &
    Lundgren, 2018). Agricultural activities contribute approximately 30% of total
    greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and
    animal wastes, a rate which is expected to increase due to growing global population
    and elevated food production demand (IAEA, 2019). Alternative forms of input-efficient
    agriculture such as regenerative agriculture and permaculture are generally focused
    on soil carbon (C) sequestration have been suggested as possible solutions to
    produce positive outcomes on greenhouse gas budgets (Smith et al., 2019). Monoculture''s
    nexus of concerns is more of a threat to developing countries since agriculture
    continues to be the principal source of revenue and means of support for many
    rural families (Pretty & Bharucha, 2014). It has been investigated that developing
    countries with little adaptation capacities are the territories most likely to
    face severe food insecurity (UNCTAD & Ulrich, 2011). To that end, the scourge
    to food security is closely linked to vulnerabilities in the cropping system promoting
    a production culture relying heavily on mechanization and agrochemicals which
    poses deleterious impacts on the ecosystems (Crews et al., 2018). The situation
    is further exacerbated because poorer countries have little safeguards against
    externalities in the first place. Further, they are normally located in mostly
    arid and semi-arid regions with marginal soils and are more prone to the negative
    effects of climate change limiting their abilities to compete with industrialized
    economies. Recent meta-analysis have listed that land degradation, depletion,
    and pollution of physical, chemical, and biological resources of the environment,
    and their associated disproportionate costs as the primary negative results from
    row crop agriculture and its narrow focus (de Graaff et al., 2019; Pothula et
    al., 2019). While a variety of measures to mitigate the environmental externalities
    have been explored, challenges remain (Foley et al., 2011). For instance, agriculture
    remains the single largest nonpoint source of water pollutants (Dowd et al., 2008;
    EPA, 2000). Additionally, there is still the threat to human health from occupational
    workers and consumer exposure to pesticides (Lam et al., 2017). Sustainability
    in food security is not an insurmountable problem. Some notable solutions that
    have been suggested to solve the problems of achieving sustainable agricultural
    production and food security have been agroecology, ecological intensification,
    sustainable intensification (SI) and regenerative agriculture (Bommarco et al.,
    2013; Cassman, 1999; Pretty & Bharucha, 2014; Tomich et al., 2011). 3 REGENERATIVE
    AGRICULTURE: THE SUSTAINABLE TRANSITION OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES Regenerative
    agriculture is a set of approaches that emphasizes and make the most of naturally
    occurring beneficial soil–plant interactions, relying less on external inputs
    and taking advantage of ecological agricultural practices (Perry, 1995). The empirical
    impacts of regenerative agricultural practices are still in their incipient state
    and not widely followed by farmers. The literal meaning of “regeneration” when
    applied to agriculture means reconditioning a land to a higher state after it
    has been utilized for crop production using a variety of technical management
    practices (Figure 1). The process is a series of transformational adaptation in
    agriculture that emerges and catalyzed due to crisis and alternative techniques
    introduced to address the farming challenges (Gosnell et al., 2019). Soil is considered
    as the base for regenerative agriculture (Lal, 2020). Although regenerative agriculture
    is related to crop canopy and site-specific crop management, it is also centric
    to soil (Schreefel et al., 2020). Therefore, maintaining soil fertility by optimizing
    nutrient concentrations or strengthening crop protection strategies in agricultural
    fields by enhancing disease resistance ability of soil are key objectives to adopt
    regenerative agriculture (Lal, 2020). The literal meaning of “regeneration” is
    aligned with the concept of soil resilience under changing climate scenario. Therefore,
    the overarching objective is to create, support, and maintain the natural biogeochemical
    cycle and interdependence aimed at improving agricultural and food systems sustainability
    (Lacanne & Lundgren, 2018). Indigenous agricultural practices have traditionally
    focused on enhancing productivity while maintaining soil health. Three sister
    cropping in the indigenous communities like Navajo, Cahokian, Mvskoke, Mississipian
    tribes of the United States focuses on growing corn (Zea mays L.), squash (Cucurbita
    spp.), and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in the same field (Hill, 2020; Mt. Pleasant,
    2006). Employing symbiotic and companion plant relationships, corn, the staple
    food of most tribes provides support for the climbing bean, which in turn provide
    N to the soil for all three plants through N2 fixation. The third plant squash,
    acts as a cover crop and mulch, suppresses weeds and pests, protects soil from
    erosion as well as conserving soil moisture for the benefit of all three plants.
    On the other hand, legumes growing in the same field fixes N in the soil to support
    the growth of three crops. In this integrative approach of sustainability, livestock
    forms the essential part of regenerative agriculture. The grazing pattern of sheep
    and cattle significantly impacts increased grass production and increased C sequestration
    in rangelands. Regenerative rotational grazing of sheep can increase topsoil organic
    C up to 3.6% with 30% higher springtime grass production (Díaz de Otálora et al.,
    2021). Biometric sensors and AI techniques in digital livestock farming are emerging
    tools in modern agriculture (Neethirajan & Kemp, 2021). The applications of these
    tools not only facilitate administering the health of livestock but can also allow
    for precision monitoring of the intensity of grazing in rangelands. These sensor
    nodes are intended to function as a wireless sensor network by attaching to the
    body of the livestock to compare the real-time activity of the grazing intensity
    data and inform the growers for immediate attention if readings are over or under
    the reference standards of the database (Hwang & Yoe, 2011). The advancements
    in precision livestock farming using proximal and biometric sensors allows for
    the monitoring of the physiological and behavioral health of the livestock over
    time and space (Neethirajan, 2017). The integration of biometric sensors with
    bioinformatics and AI algorithms can also help in identifying desirable traits
    of cattle for breeding programs (Ellen et al., 2019). The degradation of topsoil
    can be avoided by increasing the soil organic C in the rhizosphere. Recent studies
    on the inclusion of cover crops in agricultural rotations have shown significant
    increases in soil organic C (Jian et al., 2020). Including legume cover crops
    in the soil also enhances the soil biological activity and increased plant-available
    N (Sullivan & Andrews, 2012). In integrated crop–livestock farming, cover crops
    facilitate reconditioning of soils due to their crop diversity and mitigate ecological
    constraints. Using annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as a cover crop has
    shown an increase in the average daily weight of livestock while also maintaining
    crop diversity (Planisich et al., 2021). Similarly, the application of green manure
    [crops grown and turned into the soil to enhance and improve their nutritive qualities,
    for example, Sesbania rostrata (Brem.)] with organic amendments has been shown
    to improve soil physical, chemical, and microbial activities (Maitra et al., 2018).
    Green manure with organic amendments under reduced tillage have shown to improve
    aggregate stability, higher content of N, P, exchangeable cations, and microbial
    respiration in orchard crops (Luján Soto et al., 2021). The incorporation of regenerative
    agricultural practices into cropping systems can increase nutrient cycling and
    subsequent soil health through a number of mechanisms. For example, the addition
    of N to the soil through symbiotic N2 fixation of legumes (Peyraud et al., 2014).
    Fornara and Tilman (2009) described the improvements in soil structure and health
    from increased soil organic matter, soil microorganisms and biological activities
    from increased plant diversity during decomposition. Then there is the decreased
    nutrient loss and increased soil water retention from increased plant diversity
    which increases crop productivity (Florence & McGuire, 2020) while simultaneously
    decreasing environmental contamination. Both diverse agronomic managements and
    cropping systems are key components of an integrated pest management system. Flood
    (2010) reported that agricultural pests including pathogens and weeds resulted
    up to a third of crop loss. There is very good evidence that regenerative agriculture
    and permaculture which affords both diversity in time, space, crops, and agronomic
    practices allows for both the alteration of host and nonhost crop species and
    simultaneously eliminating or reducing host and nonhost crop pests (Chauvel et
    al., 2001; Petit et al., 2018). This in turn reduces the use of synthetic pesticides
    and resulting negative environmental consequences such as aquatic pollution and
    reduction of beneficial pollinator populations. The practice of regenerative agriculture
    is especially beneficial for the small farming system since it lacks the necessary
    financial resources for more intensive agricultural production systems. Whereas
    environment, climate, and financial resources have had diverse effects on agriculture
    infrastructure in developing countries they still have the same supports and infrastructure
    for regenerative agriculture. This is because regenerative agriculture is an approach
    that emphasizes practices that are location specific. Any approach that tailored
    agriculture practices to local circumstances are more likely to be successful
    in alleviating problems in agricultural food supplies because initiatives are
    focused on local production systems and local economies (Clover, 2003). Thus far,
    limited research has been documented to describe and evaluate the comparisons
    of various regenerative agriculture practices. A greater ecosystem services and
    profitability for farmers have been generated by regenerative agriculture than
    a highly intensive monoculture corn cropping system in a study throughout the
    northern plains of the United States (Lacanne & Lundgren, 2018). The significance
    of regenerative agriculture is that it adopts goals such as sustainability through
    water and nutrient recycling and preservation. Studies showed a reduction in the
    depletion of natural resources from regenerative agriculture which has increased
    the provisioning of ecosystems services and local economies (Czekaj et al., 2020;
    Duncan, 2016; Luján Soto et al., 2021). Regenerative agriculture also calls attention
    to the wide range of opportunities that exist for farmers to use local organic
    waste in their agronomic management practices (Larney & Angers, 2012). Another
    important requirement for regenerative agriculture is the integration of agricultural
    processes for environmental stewardship that is critical for a sustainable food
    future with a positive outcome in long-term food security. 4 SUSTAINABLE FOOD
    FUTURE UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE The burgeoning population along with the high demand
    for global food production under changing climate has necessitated conditions
    to conserve available natural resources for sustainable agriculture production.
    It is predicted that climate change will bring about extreme weather conditions
    such as drought, flood, fire, hurricane, frost, and infrequent and uneven precipitation
    which will impact crop yields and reduce available land under traditional cropping
    systems (Olesen & Bindi, 2002). Under these changing climates saving water, increasing
    water use efficiency, soil nutrient management, and protecting crops from adverse
    environmental conditions are important considerations to develop future agricultural
    strategies. Modern agriculture has adapted to new strategies, which involve new
    innovative/transformative technologies and sustainable intensification of agriculture
    (Figure 2). Urban agricultural productions systems including micro- (e.g., green
    roofs, green walls, courtyards, backyards, street verges etc.), meso-(e.g., community
    gardens, community allotments, urban parks etc.), and macro-scales have also been
    proven to be sustainable models (Nandwani, 2016). Improved crop genotypes tolerant
    to drought are being used in developing countries, for example, drought-tolerant
    maize developed by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and
    The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) have increased maize
    yields by 20–30% under drought conditions in Africa. Gene editing for seed improvements
    can produce more crops and improve nutrition outcomes. Further, the micro-dosing
    technique of fertilizer placement has helped many smallholder agricultural farmers
    to increase their sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and millet (Panicum miliaceum
    L.) yields by 44–120% in Africa (Fan, 2020). Additionally, biofortification of
    foods using plant breeding as a cutting-edge approach has enabled increased vitamin
    and mineral density in crops using plant breeding and transgenic techniques (Bouis
    & Saltzman, 2017). Solar-powered irrigation pumps are one of Africa''s most promising
    solutions to climate change adaption and mitigation, and have contributed to reductions
    in hunger and malnutrition (Mohammed Wazed et al., 2018). FIGURE 2 Open in figure
    viewer Various ways of adopting modern agricultural technologies as part of regenerative
    and precision agricultural systems to attain agricultural and environmental sustainability
    The SI targets environmental sustainability while tackling climate change and
    producing more food with less natural resources. Climate-smart agriculture is
    the new SI which is an integrative approach to increase agricultural productivity
    to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security, and development.
    It helps to adapt and build the resilience of agricultural and food security systems
    to climate change at multiple levels, and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    from agriculture (Chandra et al., 2018; Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2017; Taylor, 2018).
    China implemented another strategy for sustainable development known as Agricultural
    Green Development, which coordinates “green” with “development”. It aims to transform
    current agriculture with high resource consumption and high environmental costs
    into green agriculture in rural areas with high productivity, high resource use
    efficiency, and low environmental impact (Shen et al., 2020). 5 RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY
    FOR SUSTAINABLE AND REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE Despite progress in agricultural
    production and productivity, environmental and ecological challenges such as soil
    erosion, nutrient leaching, and soil and water pollution persist that ultimately
    limits many ecosystems functions. Agricultural diversification that operates outside
    the established goals of just “productive efficiency” and greater profits would
    be critical in achieving food security (Brunori et al., 2013; Gomiero et al.,
    2011; Lasley et al., 1993; Marsden, 2004). Agroecosystems based on integrated
    systems of low input farming can help address the shortcomings of monoculture
    and contribute to more sustainable food security and food sovereignty. The regenerative
    agriculture approach involves farming systems that are more responsive to biological
    and ecosystem interactions rather than only yields and output. More holistic focused
    agriculture can contribute to bolstered food security, especially for rural farming
    communities in developing countries. The critical aspect of modern sustainable
    and regenerative agriculture is to adopt multiple modern agricultural technologies
    along with managing agricultural inputs precisely. Few such traditional practices
    are being used from the last two decades in different parts of the worlds as follows:  Irrigation
    scheduling based on daily historical crop evapotranspiration is potentially a
    prospective method for increasing water use efficiency by reducing soil water
    evaporation and preventing groundwater depletion especially in low rainfall regions
    (Bonachela et al., 2006).  Screen house in a large field set-up (e.g., banana
    [Musa X paradisiaca L.] farm) enabled a 30% increase in water use efficiency in
    developing countries (Tanny et al., 2015).  Closed-loop systems which are soilless
    irrigation systems in hydroponic arrangement that helps reduce the amount of water
    needed for irrigation while optimizing the nutrient management in an urban agriculture
    farm setting have promoted sustainable environmental practices by reducing irrigated
    water use by 40% as well as fertilizer use by 35–54% per day (Rufí-Salís et al.,
    2020).  Soilless culture using crop coefficient for irrigation has been another
    way to improve water use efficiency in recirculating systems that recapture drain
    water for reuse especially in a limited resource and low-cost farming systems
    in developing countries (Gruda, 2009).  Slow release biofertilizers, produced
    by encapsulation technology, can breakdown nutrients and make them available to
    plants for longer durations, thus enhancing plant growth and productivity while
    mitigating environmental pollution and nutrient leaching (Chen et al., 2014; Ju
    et al., 2009).  Phi-based farming system, as an emerging novel strategy in modern
    agriculture can potentially minimize the algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs
    generated from P fertilizers application in agricultural fields (Chaudhary et
    al., 2020).  Conservation agriculture (CA) is based on reduced tillage, maintaining
    crop residues as soil cover, and crop rotation and is highly promoted for sustainable
    soil management practiced in North and South America (Hobbs et al., 2008; Kassam
    et al., 2009).  Fertilizer deep placement (FDP) was developed for Asian rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) systems in the 1980s. This method involves placing the compressed briquettes
    of fertilizer deeper in the soil (>10 cm), close to the roots of transplanted
    rice which drastically increased rice grain yields while reducing the amount of
    required fertilizer (Roger et al., 1980). Many modern agricultural technologies
    are being used and suggested as a part of precision and regenerative agriculture
    as well as integrative permaculture (Figure 2) as follows:  Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) and variable rate nutrient (VRN) technology: VRI is variable rate irrigation
    system that applies irrigation according to detailed mapping and monitoring of
    soil variability thereby reducing drainage losses (Trout et al., 2008).  In a
    VRI system, sensors can unlock the full potential of variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) systems enabling optimal water applications in an irrigated cropping system.
    Evans and King (2010) reported water savings of up to 26% for a wide range of
    crop such as corn, pasture, potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean [Glycine max
    (L.) Merr.], sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum
    Mill.).  The VRN is variable rate nutrient technology where nutrients are applied
    to match up the soil and crop requirement to prevent nutrient loss and increase
    efficiency. These technologies utilize a range of approaches covering sensor-based
    approaches, real-time sensors, and feedback controls to measure soil properties
    or crop characteristics and immediately use this signal to control the variable-rate
    applicator. They are helpful to deal with soil spatial heterogeneity varying rates
    of irrigation and nutrient. Variable-rate irrigation decreased about 80–85% annual
    load of N and P downstream as compared to uniform rate irrigation (URI) in a long-term
    study conducted under an intensively grazed dairy system (McDowell, 2017). It
    was found to be potentially a useful approach for irrigation management for improving
    crop yield in an onion (Allium cepa L.) field in the humid environment of England
    (González Perea et al., 2018). In another study with an irrigated corn crop, Bausch
    and Diker (2001) reported that VRI technology reduced N fertilizer application
    by 39 kg N ha–1 with no reduction in corn grain yield.  Water smart agriculture
    project in Central America helped small farmers develop long-term digital soil
    mapping system which enables wise use of natural resources in the present context
    of growing global challenges for food security under changing climate (Owens et
    al., 2020).  DSSAT for Conservation, Optimization and Precision Agriculture: A
    real-time control and optimization in irrigation management system has been presented
    as a potential option for water savings by Koech and Langat (2018). Decision Support
    System in Agricultural Technologies (DSSAT) can provide fundamental support to
    the growers to decide and optimize their practices for precise nutrient, water,
    energy, and pest management. These integrated solutions by combining soil or canopy-based
    sensors or spectral/thermal imagery with cloud-based telemetric services allows
    for easy management of the crop field throughout the growing season without going
    to the field to take in-situ intensive measurements (Bazzani, 2005; Rinaldi &
    He, 2014).  The trend of using multiple sensors and spectral imagery available
    for a wide range of cropping and agricultural systems would address the issue
    of global food security by minimizing the environmental footprint. Figure 3 represents
    the Irrigation Decision Support System (IDSS) using spectral imagery for determining
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of three agricultural fields in
    the Central Valley of California. The dark brown bands in Figure 3a shows low
    emergence and vigor due to low NDVI. On the contrary, the green bands in Figure
    3b and c show uniform emergence. Identifying the dark brown to orange bands in
    Figure 3a and b is useful for the grower to precisely manage the areas that required
    attention in terms of nutrient or moisture management.  Remote sensing and aerial
    image-based technology: Utilization and applying remote sensing with proximal
    image processing to manage agricultural inputs such as nutrients, soil, or water
    is a recent trend. A recent review concluded that crop water use efficiency can
    be increased by characterizing water bodies using satellite-based technologies
    such as proximal and remote sensing (Cancela et al., 2019). Future agricultural
    production would rely more on remote sensing techniques to better utilize agricultural
    inputs. The recent development and utilization of drone-based technology in agricultural
    field to implement best management practices as well as integrated pest management
    for crop production have drawn much attention. A good review of examples and application
    is presented in Bastiaanssen et al. (2000).  Drone-based technology: Drones, which
    are not currently in full use for most agriculture operations but have become
    increasingly affordable is another promising option. Drone use will enable farmers
    to improve yields by monitoring crops more frequently and accurately, allowing
    for more controlled and precise pesticide and fertilizer applications, intervening
    remotely when necessary (Puri et al., 2017).  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs):
    The WSNs can be used as a sophisticated and useful tool of precision agriculture
    management to aid in agricultural decision-making systems (e.g., irrigation water
    or fertilizer application monitoring systems. Lately, researcher have shown WSNs
    as an efficient way of managing agricultural field through these WSNs technologies
    (Adão et al., 2017; Jawad et al., 2017). These various wireless communication
    systems are more flexible options to manage soil, water, nutrients, and would
    bring revolution in sustainable agricultural production systems.  Regenerative
    irrigation practices: We can potentially follow the relatively new concept of
    “regenerative irrigation” as a part of regenerative agriculture to increase resource
    efficiency such as using fewer chemical fertilizers, more residue-based materials,
    reusing wastewater to increase the irrigation water use efficiency and decrease
    farm energy input. One such study has demonstrated the positive impact of bio-based
    input into the agricultural production system to boost the farm economy (Rodias
    et al., 2020).  Digital Soil Mapping (DSM): A component of water smart agriculture
    is to generate relevant informative maps of soil types, properties, and functions
    for sustainable soil and water management. This approach can be multi-level and
    its functionality can help farmers in their decision-making process (Barron, 2012;
    Falkenmark et al., 2009; Falkenmark, 2013) especially in drought-prone areas during
    challenging times of climate change (Eitzinger et al., 2012). FIGURE 3 Open in

    Inc. 6 ADAPTING INTEGRATED APPROACH: REGENERATIVE AND MODERN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY
    A narrow single approach that focuses only on conventional principles of agriculture
    production will not be sufficient to address the issue of global food security
    in the future. The key to maintaining a long-term and self-sustaining food security
    system relies upon adapting a broad encompassing approach, one for example that
    combines the fundamentals and the inter-relatedness of many different disciplines
    such as statistics and computer science. The proper combination of specific technology
    that can not only provide indicators but tangible spatial measurements should
    be a priority. Considerable scope exists for a diverse range of such technologies
    and sensors with diverse capabilities. For example, biodegradable soil moisture
    sensors that not only monitor but provides soil moisture measurements could be
    available for farmers within the next 3 yr (McCauley, 2020). Also available are
    yield and weed mapping sensors, which can sense differences in production environment
    allowing farmers to quickly monitor these variables. The utilization of other
    available sensors such as climate and ground sensors that monitor a plant''s response
    to climate is another promising option and should be a priority. Data from sensors
    can measure and provide advanced analytics for early scouting of potential problems
    such as pest or weed infestation. The remote monitoring of pest activity using
    passive infra-red (PIR) sensing in pest traps has allowed the identification of
    target pests by having a low risk to secondary poisoning when baits are used and
    restricts the accidental deaths to non-target species (Parsons et al., 2020).
    The implementation of remote sensing techniques using wireless telemetric services
    aim to provide decision support to the growers for effective management of crops.
    The advances in drone imagery for multispectral, thermal, and hyperspectral mapping
    can avoid physical deployment of baits on large farms for commercial production.
    Recent advances in wireless sensor assembly using nanomaterials in combination
    with novel mutant enzymes with progressive integrative with solar cells has enriched
    the possibilities for development of biosensors for detecting the photosynthetic
    inhibiting herbicides (Bucur et al., 2018). The advancements in biosensor development
    using nanomaterials requires extensive research to monitor residual effects in
    the soil and biota of the environment. Remote sensing which includes the above-mentioned
    technologies along with satellite imagery (Figure 3a–c) and global information
    system once more fully adopted will go a long way towards achieving food security.
    Farming in controlled agricultural environments is another viable and promising
    option. Controlled in-house farming uses the benefits and efficiencies of precision
    agriculture to provide the optimal conditions to grow crops in an environmentally
    friendly way. This innovation offers farmers greater predictability as crops can
    be produced year-round since production is not affected by extreme weather or
    climatic conditions (Ramin Shamshiri et al., 2018). Nanotechnology is another
    promising technology that increases production while allowing for control and
    management of inputs. The technology is a set of nanotools capable of detecting
    minute differences or deficiencies in parameters such as soil nutrients, soil
    temperatures, plant health, or the presence of pathogens. This then allows for
    specific corrective responses to deliver with high levels of precision (Prasad
    et al., 2017) to maintain the health of both soils and plants. Despite the potential
    benefits of modern digital (e.g., DSSAT model) and climate-smart agricultural
    practices, its adoption can be challenging especially under small-to-medium-scale
    farming systems with limited farm resources. Two critical factors we should focus
    on providing the ultimate benefits of smart agriculture technologies involve:
    (a) farm size and (b) input–output cost benefit of the farm production. For example,
    site-specific and optimized irrigation management can be achieved through real-time
    soil moisture or crop canopy temperature data. On a bigger scale, spectral imagery
    acquired by aerial flights or satellite data can precisely estimate water stress.
    Therefore, the selection of decision support for moisture management depends on
    farm size or farm resource availability. In general, for small-scale and subsistence
    farms, sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature, and other parameters
    (e.g., Watermark sensors, Irrometer tensiometer etc.) can be performed easily
    with grower''s mobile services. These direct and affordable web applications can
    provide easy, inexpensive, and accessible knowledge of the moisture status in
    field and help in irrigation scheduling. However, application of spectral imagery
    (e.g., Ceres Imaging Inc.) might not be accommodating for small-scale farming
    given economic constraints. Often, the knowledge and solutions for small-scale
    and limited resource farms depend on the understanding of factors that influence
    social-behavioral change, and the indicators they select to monitor those processes.
    Today''s digital agriculture is being supported by either web-based decision support
    tools or smartphone applications for pest or disease recognition. It would be
    interesting to see how these tools are being used effectively by the farming community
    to improve their existing farming practices. Therefore, the end-user adoption
    of this information can only be useful if the interpretation is user-friendly
    to the growers. For example, reporting NDVI in agricultural fields with a color
    range from green (∼uniformity and good vigor) to orange to red (∼stressed plants)
    could effectively be implemented as part of precision crop management (Figure
    3). The recent pandemic has influenced the farmers'' decisions about farm management
    practices. Thus, the strategies to develop and continue sustainable agricultural
    practices using digital and precision technologies and tools under this situation
    were and would be critical. Therefore, growers across the world including small
    and limited resources farmers have to create new strategies for virtual and successful
    development of farming practices. For example, on-farm trials, virtual field days,
    virtually engaging farmers groups, development of digital decision support tools
    were newly initiated or continued as a part of previous farm management practices
    that engaged and empowered farmers under this pandemic condition. 7 INTEGRATIVE
    PERMACULTURE: FUSION OF DATA SCIENCES (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING)
    WITH MODERN AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY The advancement in agricultural technology
    has revolutionized the recent trends in precision agriculture. The groundbreaking
    development in acquiring big data from crop fields aims to minimize the environmental
    footprint. The developments in WSNs and drone technology have not only helped
    the agricultural sector in acquiring big and precise data for crop and soil management
    (Zhou et al., 2012), but has also allowed to achieve 4-R stewardship by avoiding
    the blanket approach of crop production. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is
    collaborating with technological giants like Microsoft to help farmers cut costs
    of production and increase the yield by sustainably considering the global climate
    change. Integrating proximal sensing devices (e.g., portable X-ray fluorescence
    spectrometer, Vis-NIR spectrometry, NixPro) with predictive modeling techniques
    allows for rapid and in-situ elemental analysis by developing site-specific or
    region-specific models (Jha, Ulery, et al., 2021; Jha, Mukhopadhyay, et al., 2021;
    Mukhopadhyay et al., 2020; Weindorf et al., 2016). Additionally, inclusion of
    spatiotemparal imagery using multi and hyper-spectral mapping allows precise,
    optimized, and regenerative management of agricultural crops using properties
    like electrical conductivity, evapotranspiration, canopy cover, water stress,
    and vegetation index (Table 1), Nocco et al. (2019) investigated the implication
    of High-Resolution Mapping of Evapotranspiration (HRMET) model and aerial imagery
    to identify the potential benefits of water management in precision cultivation
    of sweet corn and potato crop rotations. Crop models similar to HRMET can widely
    be applied in comparing rotational practices using ground management vs. the model
    parameters. For example, the HRMET model has shown promising results for sweet
    corn and potato rotations when modeled evapotranspiration maps were compared to
    field observations in potato, sweet corn, and pea (Pisum sativum L.) agroecosystems
    (Nocco et al., 2019). This optimization towards irrigation management and application
    efficiency are effective in buffering against the climate variability. TABLE 1.

    have widely allowed monitoring the physiological crop stress, nutrient deficiency,
    crop pest, and diseases/weed management (Chlingaryan et al., 2018; Lamb & Brown,
    2001; Mehra et al., 2016) and digital soil mapping (McBratney et al., 2019) (Table
    1). Machine learning algorithms allows for the development of risk assessment
    models that can help in making disease management decisions prior to the planting
    of crop like wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). For examples,
    techniques like Artificial Neural Networks and regression trees as mentioned in
    Table 1 can be used to help solve problems of Stagonospora nodorum blotch in winter
    wheat (Mehra et al., 2016). Similarly, Bayesian framework can also be used in
    automated identification and algorithmic identification of weeds in corn crops
    (Chlingaryan et al., 2018; Tellaeche et al., 2008). Therefore, the algorithmic
    approach of AI and ML facilitate a reduction in residual toxicity and therefore
    achieve the sustainable goals of regenerative agriculture and integrative permaculture.
    Further, researchers have combined the knowledge of high-performance computing,
    sensor/drone technology, and ML algorithms for grain production. For example,
    comparison of red–green–blue, multispectral and thermal data of agricultural plots
    used to assess the genotypic differences in crop vigor and yield by ground and
    unmanned aerial vehicle measurements in wheat, reported similar platform proximity
    in yield assessment (Jha, Sihi, et al., 2021; Patrício & Rieder, 2018). Similarly,
    the aerial measurements due to their large spatial coverage provide improved reliability
    of management zone delineation by evaluating the variability across cropping areas
    (Khosla et al., 2010). The combination of big data modeling and clustering methods
    has enabled crop yield predictions according to management zone delineation (Pantazi
    et al., 2015). The clustering methods in crop yield predictions can be used in
    understanding the response of plant growth as a result of soil properties and
    their spatiotemporal variability. Groenendyk et al. (2014) investigated the relationship
    between plant growth and soil texture. For their study, the authors simulated
    wheat growth using HYDRUS 1D hydrological model and a k-means clustering algorithm
    approach. Results showed significant relationship between estimating crop yield
    and soil texture. Techniques involving artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been used in paddy production to estimate
    the in-farm emission of greenhouse gases throughout the growing season (Nabavi-Pelesaraei
    et al., 2018). This is useful in modeling the food-energy nexus in paddy production
    and creating an efficient system of minimizing the environmental impacts in a
    computationally inexpensive manner. Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS)
    approach has also proved to be an important methodology to identify and correlate
    yield and variables impacting crop production (Emamgolizadeh et al., 2015; Zabihi
    et al., 2019). Turpin et al. (2005) has identified dominant factors affecting
    corn establishment and grain yields using MARS automated regression data mining
    method. Their study concluded that soil water content and cone penetration resistance
    are key parameters than elevation and mineralizable soil N in predicting crop
    establishment and grain yield. Padarian et al. (2020) used a probabilistic model
    to report the key research areas in soil science that utilizes ML techniques.
    Main topics included soil salinity (Khadim et al., 2019), soil organic C dynamics,
    soil moisture content (Greifeneder et al., 2019), pedometrics timeline (McBratney
    et al., 2019), spatial disaggregation (Flynn et al., 2019), soil mapping and modeling
    regional soil covariates (Caubet et al., 2019; Padarian et al., 2020), and soil
    physicochemical properties (Khadim et al., 2019; Lamb & Brown, 2001; Viscarra
    Rossel & McBratney, 1998). Regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and precision
    farming are overarching tools to attain sustainable goals of food production.
    These tools combined with AI and ML techniques can allow growers and scientists
    to maximize food production with minimum utilization of available resources (Table
    1). Permaculture is associated with a paradigm shift, seeking to offer partial
    solutions for the many problems of contemporary agriculture like soil degradation
    and loss of habitat, which undermines their future capacities to produce food.
    There is no one size that fits all scenario when adapting permaculture practices
    but expected benefits are still homogenous such as a reduction in chemical use
    and increased input of organic C and N to soils (Dı́az-Zorita et al., 2002). However,
    despite many successes permaculture adoption appears to have fallen short. This
    is primarily due to variations in permaculture practices as dictated by local
    conditions and its predominant goal of focusing on local community-oriented interactions.
    The lack of supporting contemporary scientific research and experimental applications
    further reduces its adoption. There have been debates on whether permaculture
    can truly feed a growing population and questions remain as to what extent it
    outperforms intensive farming system sustainably (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Its scientific
    foundation, applicability, and scalability to large land area have also been criticized
    (Fiebrig et al., 2020). Ingram (2018) describes the confusion as a mere lack of
    good evidence and intellectual rigor. The key question to answer here is whether
    permaculture can contribute broadly to agronomic yields and food security and
    performs in such ways as to benefit the wider agricultural communities. The key
    to answering this question is in the relative distributions of the population
    between rural and urban areas. These agricultural methods may not be suited for
    the input resource-intensive modern agriculture of temperate regions of North
    America, Europe, and Asia. However, for many rural communities, for example in
    Africa and South Asia where farming is an economic livelihood, permaculture is
    an important food supply function enabling local residents to meet their dietary
    needs with local culture and culinary traditions (Ferreira et al., 2018). 8 CONCLUSION
    The challenge of sustainably meeting increased food and energy demands is omnipresent.
    Specialized crop production and agricultural intensification have satisfied those
    demands for several years; however, the future of sustainable agricultural production,
    environmental footprint, and global food security is questionable. In confronting
    the challenges of achieving sustainable food security, the agricultural sector
    must focus on not only one, but a variety of strategies to be successful and agriculture
    can become a part of the solution. A multidimensional approach is necessary. Monocropping
    production systems with innovative technologies are not going away. These systems
    will continue to benefit the wider global society through massive increases in
    crop yields and food productivity. However, such successes are not sustainable
    and will continue to come at great expense to the environment. Adoption and progress
    towards regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and modern agricultural technologies
    (Figure 2) have been successful because these systems are flexible, diverse, and
    tailored to both large-scale production systems as well as local farmers and communities.
    In addition, permaculture and regenerative agriculture promote natural ecosystems
    (e.g., land) as multi-functional and emphasizes self-sufficient and self-regulating.
    Beyond embracing varied agronomic production systems, it will be important to
    have a focus on the root causes such as land degradation and climate change. We
    have demonstrated that practices such as permaculture and regenerative agriculture
    should be infused with an integrated approach of modern agricultural technology
    as well as utilization of data sciences such as AI and ML to provide a wide range
    of beneficial input services. These will, in turn aid in achieving sustainable
    food security because in many ways their ethos is on lowering production inputs
    as well as reduce environmental footprint. The unifying premises of permaculture
    and regenerative AI, agroecosystems are taking a holistic approach rather than
    focusing on just individual parts. It helps to explore how the various systems
    and their interactions can fetch overall system benefits. These approaches should
    be seen as parts of a wide range of measures, matrices, and efforts to intuitively
    approach sustainable food security goals. For permaculture practices, scientific
    data quantifying its effect and role in a future agriculture is needed and will
    be critical to promote its adoption. Further, a more robust and holistic research
    direction is necessary to integrate all these aspects of food production for overall
    socio-economic upliftment and farm productivity while managing our mother nature
    under the events of extreme weather events and climate change. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    content Highlights • Novel site-specific water production functions (WPFs) were
    developed and tested. • New zoning procedures for variable rate irrigation were
    established. • The k-NN WPF accurately predicted cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. • Sector zoning was predicted to enhance cotton yield under supplemental
    irrigation. Abstract Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority issue
    since available fresh water resources are limited. Water production functions
    (WPFs), mathematical relationships between applied water and crop yield, are useful
    tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield reduction due to
    deficit irrigation. This study aimed at (i) designing and evaluating site-specific
    WPFs (using k nearest neighbors (k-NN), multiple linear regression, and neural
    networks), (ii) simulating yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone
    control VRI center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs, (iii) using the
    best WPF to investigate different cotton irrigation and zoning strategies using
    integer linear programming, and (iv) comparing soil-based and WPF-based zones
    for sector control VRI systems. A two-year cotton irrigation experiment (2013–2014)
    was implemented to study irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship across different
    soil types. The site-specific k-NN WPFs showed the highest performance with root
    mean square error equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
    The result indicated that variable rate irrigation with limited sector control
    capability could enhance cotton lint yield under supplemental irrigation when
    field-level spatial soil heterogeneity is significant. The temporal changes in
    climate and rainfall patterns, however, had a great impact on cotton response
    to irrigation in west Tennessee, a moderately humid region with short season environment.
    We believe site-specific WPFs are useful empirical tools for on-farm irrigation

    1.1. Variable rate irrigation The demand for food and fiber is increasing as the
    world’s population grows. Irrigation management has evolved into a top priority
    issue since available fresh water resources are limited. Row crop supplemental
    irrigation is rapidly expanding in the moderately humid region of west Tennessee
    because of a trend of stabilizing yields by irrigation and high commodity prices.
    However, the soils of west Tennessee exhibit high spatial and temporal variability
    of soil characteristics that relate to moisture availability for crop production
    at the field-level. It has been shown in a variety of studies that soil characteristics
    such as soil water holding capacity and depth of soil significantly affects crop
    yield, hence irrigation strategies should be adjusted in regard to the soil type
    (Duncan, 2012). Consequently, variable rate irrigation (VRI) is recommended as
    the appropriate irrigation scenario to address field-level spatiotemporal heterogeneity
    and thus how, when, and where to irrigate (Duncan, 2012). VRI is expected to improve
    water-use efficiency, increase productivity, save fuel and decrease nutrient leaching
    (Pan et al., 2013). Several authors have stressed the potential water conservation
    that has been observed using VRI systems (Evans et al., 1996, Duke et al., 1997,
    Sadler et al., 2005, Hedley and Yule, 2009). For instance, Hedley and Yule (2009)
    compared VRI and conventional uniform irrigation methods and found that 9–19%
    of irrigation water was saved, which in turn reduced nitrogen leaching. The state-of-the-art
    zone control VRI systems, allow farmers to adjust irrigation applications across
    fields, by pulsing individual sprinklers or banks of sprinklers on and off. The
    sector control VRI systems cut pie shape zones simply by adjusting the revolution
    speed of the center pivot between given pairs of angles. Pan et al. (2013) analyzed
    soil water status through spatial and temporal data and suggested this method
    as a means to assess the potential of VRI and to schedule irrigation. Recently,
    Haghverdi et al. (2015b) used integer linear programing (ILP) to find the optimum
    number and spatial arrangement of irrigation management zones for center pivot
    systems with limited sector control capability. They used soil properties to delineate
    management zones, yet suggested to investigate crop response to water amount across
    different soil types as a means to provide crop-specific irrigation management
    zones. In practice, the level of irrigation management being followed by the majority
    of producers is relatively low, while experience with successful zone control
    VRI management is rare among producers and service providers. Initially, the larger
    price tag, accompanied with the fear of complexity that is associated with using
    zone control VRI, are the two main stumbling blocks experienced by farmers. The
    sector control VRI systems require less capital investment and the operation/maintenance
    is also easier than that of zone control VRI. Most of the center pivots that farmers
    use today are equipped to allow a limited number of pie shape sectors to be made,
    without any additional control panel upgrades. The knowledge and full use of this
    capability is the perfect and most appropriate step in bridging the gap between
    current practice and cutting-edge zone control technology (Haghverdi et al., 2015b).
    Currently, it is not easy to quantify the potential production benefits of zone
    control and sector control VRI systems over conventional uniform irrigation systems
    in a given field, further contributing to producers’ present hesitancy and reluctance,
    with regards to investing in VRI systems. However, before the benefits of VRI
    can be achieved, it is necessary to identify the spatial heterogeneity of soil
    within a given field and delineate homogenous management zones wherein identical
    inputs of water can be applied. In practice, the number of zones depends on the
    target input, available equipment and the crop(s) planted. However, a corollary
    expectation is that varying the inputs within the management zones will facilitate
    optimal yields. This desire leads to the development of water production functions
    (WPF) where crop yield is mathematically related to the amount of irrigation water.
    1.2. Water production functions The term production function (PF) may be assigned
    to any mathematical relationship between crop yield and input components such
    as water, fertilizers and energy (De Juan et al., 1996). In practice, almost all
    the derived PFs require crop water use as an independent variable. PFs predict
    total dry matter (or marketable product of each crop) as a dependent variable,
    while the independent variables are transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET) or
    the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). The PFs are categorized into
    crop water production functions (CWPFs) and water production functions (WPF) that
    use ET and IW as independent variables, respectively. IW may consist of different
    components such as the crop water requirement, pre-planting irrigation, leaching
    requirement, and rainfall (Igbadun et al., 2007). Recently, some studies have
    aimed to revisit and rebuild the concept of PF including the development of a
    WPF for water logging stress on corn (Kuang et al., 2012) and a rice water – fertilizer
    PF (Ai-hua et al., 2012). Tong and Guo (2013) included an estimation of uncertainty
    in CWPF along with the optimal allocation of water resources in an irrigation
    area. Saseendran et al. (2014) established location-specific CWPFs using long-term
    averaged data for corn in Colorado. They used the RZWQM2 model (Ahuja et al.,
    2000) and historical weather data to develop average corn CWPFs across years and
    locations. Sadler et al. (2002) applied WPFs at field level and observed significant
    differences in corn response to irrigation within and across soil map units. Holan
    et al. (2008) formulated spatially dependent WPFs that later were used by Stone
    and Sadler (2015) who reported high accuracies for the spatial modeling of corn
    yield. Wang et al. (2007) derived cotton and wheat water-salinity PFs. Dinar et
    al. (1986) derived cotton CWPF under saline conditions in California to improve
    irrigation management. Classical PFs are useful tools for irrigation management
    and economic analysis of yield reduction due to deficit irrigation, but there
    are some shortcomings associated with them. The behavior of complex ecological
    systems is non-linear, but most PFs are based on easily built linear regression-based
    equations and are thus not particularly powerful representations of these systems
    (Dai et al., 2011, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). However, recent studies have investigated
    the use of more robust and non-linear techniques to predict yield and model complex
    systems, particularly powerful empirical algorithms derived from machine learning
    data mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al., 2010, Haghverdi et al., 2014b). Data mining
    could be defined as the process of capturing important and useful information
    from large data sets (Mucherino et al., 2009). An extensive review on data mining
    methods and their application in agricultural related studies was gathered by
    Huang et al. (2010). Machine learning algorithms were employed to some extent
    for predicting yield of different crops. Fortin et al. (2010) used artificial
    neural networks (ANNs) for predicting potato tuber growth as well as its in-field
    variations in Canada. They reported that if enough data is input to an ANN model,
    one can precisely model site-specific tuber growth. Dai et al. (2011) adopted
    ANN and multi-linear regression models to simulate the response of sunflower yield
    to soil moisture and salinity. This resulted in ANN models having higher precision
    than regression for modeling relationships between crop yield and soil moisture
    and salinity at different crop growth periods (Dai et al., 2011). Haghverdi et
    al. (2014b) derived some novel WPFs and compared data mining-based methods with
    traditional regression procedures. They utilized ANN and decision tree modeling
    algorithms to derive water salinity PFs for spring wheat and found the results
    promising. 1.3. Site-specific water production functions & variable rate irrigation
    Traditional irrigation/agronomic work tries to address the irrigation related
    questions by means of small plot trials over multiple sites and across several
    years. This is probably the best way to collect the necessary data in controlled
    environments following the statistical principles behind design of experiments.
    However, there are some shortcomings. Given the time consuming and labor intensive
    nature of field experiments, this approach becomes unrealistic for the near future
    (Drummond et al., 2003). In addition, this method relies on scaling and transforming
    small plot research findings to operational management of farmers’ fields. In
    reality, each field has its own spatial and temporal heterogeneity of main attributes
    and this complexity requires site-specific irrigation management solutions. An
    alternative option is to simulate the behavior of the fields using mechanistic
    crop growth models. However, the drawback of these models is that they are time-consuming
    and expensive to develop because of the numerous inputs that need to be collected
    to run them (Drummond et al., 2003). Precision agriculture (PA) enables farmers
    to collect numerous site-specific data. Empirical analysis of these data may be
    the key to aid farmers in their occupational practice. PA is successful if accurate
    and detailed information about crop response to specific conditions is provided
    (Drummond et al., 2003). Quantifying crop response to water is the first step
    toward optimizing irrigation, and is therefore a critical issue for farmers, governmental
    agencies and consulting companies. Given the time consuming and expensive nature
    of irrigation studies, developing computer tools and models are very helpful in
    providing a comprehensive understanding of irrigation-yield relationship for different
    crops across different soil types. Robust algorithms are needed for identifying
    site-specific crop yield responses to environmental and management parameters
    and helping to find either optimum practices or alternative scenarios. The increased
    cost and complexity of variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems compared to conventional
    systems are the main obstacles barring widespread adaptation by farmers. VRI related
    research projects have mainly focused on (i) designing sprinklers to spatially
    vary irrigation rates and (ii) developing software/hardware for guiding the VRI
    system (Pan et al., 2013). There thus remains by necessity, novel models and techniques
    that simplify irrigation zone delineation, and provide an estimation of attainable
    production benefits of VRI systems, the main goal of this study. The objectives
    of this study are to: (i) Use multiple data mining techniques to design customized
    site-specific WPFs for cotton. (ii) Determine the best site-specific WPF for cotton.
    (iii) Simulate yield maps for uniform, sector control VRI, and zone control VRI
    center pivot systems using the site-specific WPFs. (iv) Formulate an optimization
    problem for sector control VRI systems using integer linear programing and water
    production functions to maximize yield. (v) Compare the spatial arrangement of
    the optimum soil-based and WPF-based irrigation management zones for sector control
    VRI center pivot systems. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Field of study A 73-ha
    cotton field that contained two center pivots for irrigation within which the
    resident farmer practiced uniform nitrogen (N) application and variable rate potassium
    and phosphorus application was selected as the study area (Fig. 1). The field
    is located in southwestern Dyer County in west Tennessee within a moderately humid
    region along the Mississippi river. The fields are Mississippi river terrace alluvial
    deposits that have produced Robinsonville loam and fine sandy loam, Commerce silty
    clay loam, and Crevasse sandy loam soils (Fig. 1). The mean monthly growing season
    precipitation and temperature is 97 mm month−1 and 21 °C from May to November,
    respectively. Soil sampling and modeling of the fields different soil constituents,
    particularly soil available water content, showed substantial spatial heterogeneity
    and as much as a four-fold increase in the variability of available soil water
    content within the effective root zone across the field (Haghverdi et al., 2015c).
    Given the spatial variability of these soil properties, this field was an ideal
    site for a study of the spatial optimization of a VRI system. Download : Download

    Dyer County, Tennessee, USA. 2.2. Irrigation experiment A two-year experiment
    (2013–2014) was implemented to study the irrigation-cotton lint yield relationship
    across the different soil types. The field was no-tillage planted to cotton (‘PHY375’
    variety) on the 30th of May, 2013, and to cotton (‘Stoneville 4946’ variety) on
    the 5th of May, 2014. Crop pest management was implemented following state extension
    recommendations. In the first year, the field was harvested on December 2–3, 2013
    and in the 2nd year it was harvested on October 18–20, 2014. There is some overlap
    between the two center pivots that cover the majority of the field (Fig. 2). Irrigation
    scheduling was carried out by the producer since the optimum practical goal was
    to enhance knowledge and expertise of the farmer over the course of the experiment.
    We provided sufficient information for the farmer to irrigate appropriately using
    a wireless network of soil sensors installed throughout the field of study, as
    well as an on-site weather station to estimate ET. Additionally, the Management
    of Irrigation Systems in Tennessee (MOIST) program (http://bioengr.ag.utk.edu/weather/)
    was employed to assist the farmer with irrigation scheduling. MOIST is an irrigation
    decision support tool that delivers irrigation recommendations that consider both
    ET and soil water status. We simulated spatial variability in water application
    across different soil types (Fig. 2) by programing the pivots and partially swapping
    the sprinklers. The pivot’s control panels were Valley Select2 module (Valmont
    Industries, Inc) that were programmable up to 9 sectors, thus allowing one to
    vary the location, frequency, and amount of irrigation across the field by changing
    the travel speed of the irrigation system. Consequently, the sprinklers were swapped
    to apply approximately 50% more/less irrigation water (IW) than the farmer’s decision.
    The IW on sector zones was between 25% and 30% higher/lower than the IW that was
    set by the farmer. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download

    water, respectively (a). The center pivots is shown in relation to the spatial

    the study area (b). This figure is adapted from Haghverdi et al. (2015c). 2.3.
    Input attributes and data preparation Table 1 summarizes the data used in this
    study to derive the WPFs. The field was sampled on March 21 and 22, 2014 where
    400 undisturbed core soil samples from 100 sampling locations at 4 different depths
    were collected to measure soil texture, soil water content, and bulk density.
    Then, the soil water retention curves were predicted for samples using pseudo-continuous
    pedotransfer functions (Haghverdi et al., 2014a) and interpolated to generate
    high-resolution maps. In addition, soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    was collected using a Veris 3100 (Veris Technologies, Salina, KS) instrument.
    More information on proximal soil data collection/sensing and modeling is provided
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). The cotton lint yield maps were obtained from the
    yield monitors. A quality assessment of the raw cotton lint yield data was conducted
    to remove outliers and bad data. The study field was gridded into 5-m × 5-m cells
    or pixels (25 m2 area per cell) and for each cell, all attributes in Table 1 (inputs
    and outputs) were obtained. Ordinary kriging was used for interpolation. Empirical
    semivariograms were calculated using the Geostatistical Analyst toolbox in ArcGIS
    10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, California) considering 12 lags and an omnidirectional
    stable model. A total of 16,000 cells were prepared after removing cells with
    missing/bad data. Since neither pivot was shut off in the overlap zone, the water
    applied in that zone was considered to be the summation of the applied water by
    the both pivots. Table 1. Input/output attributes for deriving site-specific water

    for four layers (i.e. 0–25 cm, 25–50 cm, 50–75 cm, 75–100 cm) covering crop effective
    root zone. c The farmer practiced variable rate P and K, but nitrogen was applied
    uniformly. In many situations, there are only a few major driving forces that
    govern a system. As the number of input predictors increases, the likelihood of
    redundancy or high correlation between variables increases with more than one
    attribute capable of explaining the behavior of the system. Principal component
    analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that is used to reduce the dimensionality
    or the number of high correlations in a given data set. PCA finds hidden patterns
    within a data set and extracts the important information from the raw data and
    replaces it with a group of new input predictors called principle components.
    Principal components are orthogonal to each other and each of them is a linear
    combination of the original input attributes. (Mathworks, 2014, Abdi and Williams,
    2010). In this study, we used Matlab 2015a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.) to
    perform PCA. The Hotelling’s T2, a statistical measure of the multivariate distance
    of each observation from the center of the data set, was calculated to find the
    most important PCs. Prior to establishing WPFs, the data set was randomly divided
    into 10 almost equal-size subsets. The modeling was repeated 10 times where each
    time one subset was assigned to the test phase and the rest of them were used
    to develop the WPFs. 2.4. Modeling and simulation 2.4.1. Establishing site-specific
    water production functions Multiple linear regression water production function,
    MLR WPF Fig. 3 illustrates the three methods that were developed to establish
    site-specific WPFs. Traditionally linear regression is used to derive WPFs that
    typically result in a curvilinear representation of water-yield relationship.
    We followed the recommendations of Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and used k-means cluster
    analysis to divide the data into 4 homogenous soil property sub-groups. Then,
    for each sub-group, a separate MLR-WPF was developed considering IW, IW2 and IW
    × PCs as input predictors. The ten most important PCs were used as input for clustering.

    Fig. 3. The three workflow processes used in this study to develop customized
    site-specific water production functions (WPF) to predict cotton yields for 2
    center pivots in a 73 ha field in west Tennessee; k-NN: k nearest neighbors, PCA:
    principle component analysis, ANN: artificial neural networks. K nearest neighbors
    water production function, k-NN WPF The k-NN is a non-parametric lazy learning
    algorithm that processes all of the data when prediction of the response(s) for
    a new observation is required. The k-NN was considered to be among the top ten
    techniques used for data mining (Wu et al., 2008), but in general has been applied
    less than other data mining techniques in agricultural studies (Mucherino et al.,
    2009). The k-NN considers a distance function, such as the Euclidean distance,
    to find so-called closer observations with higher similarity. Then, it combines
    the response of the k nearest surrounding observations to predict the response
    for new observations. Fig. 3 provides a visual step-by-step guide to deriving
    the site-specific k-NN WPFs, where first the raw inputs (Table 1) were converted
    to PCs. Then, the first 10 PCs and the IW were converted to input predictors with
    a zero mean and a standard deviation of one, and then the ranges of input predictors
    were tuned following the method recommended by Nemes et al. (2006). In order to
    predict yield for a target cell of the test data set at a specific irrigation
    level (I∗), the following steps were taken. First, distance from the target cell
    to every cell in the development data set was computed as the summation of the
    differences among their input predictors: (1) where di is the distance between
    ith cell in the development data set and the target cell, Δaij is the difference
    between jth attribute of the two cells and N = 11 is the number of the input attributes.
    Second, a reference data set was created consisting of those cells in the development
    data set that had irrigation levels within a 20-mm range from the target irrigation
    level (i.e. I∗). Third, the k nearest cells to the target cell were selected from
    the reference data set. Fourth, a distance-dependent weight was assigned to each
    k nearest cell (Nemes et al., 2006): (2) where k is the number of selected nearest
    cells, p is the design parameter and wi is the weight of ith cell. Finally, the
    cotton yield for the target cell (Yp) was predicted as the weighted average of
    the yield values for the k nearest cells: (3) A cross-validation procedure was
    designed to identify the optimum k and p values. The parameter k was varied from
    1 to 10 and p was changed from 0.5 to 3 with 0.5 increments. For each combination
    of k and p parameters, a bagging technique was implemented to compute the output
    of the k-NN-WPF (Breiman, 1996). In other words, the output was the aggregation
    of the output of multiple WPFs which were established on different realizations
    of the reference dataset using sampling with replacement. Haghverdi et al. (2015a)
    recommended that the number of ensemble values be 40. The modeling was done using
    Matlab R2014a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass.). Artificial neural network water
    production function, ANN WPF The past performance of artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) suggests that they have potential to establish reasonable WPFs (Haghverdi
    et al., 2014b). A three-layer perceptron model was selected for this study. SPSS
    Modeler 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) automatically computed the best number of
    neurons to be used in the hidden layer to derive ANN WPFs. The first 10 PCs and
    IW were chosen as input predictors. The bagging technique was implemented to enhance
    model stability. The number of ensembles was chosen to be 40. Thirty percent of
    the training data were assigned to cross-validation to avoid over-fitting. 2.4.2.
    Simulating irrigation and zoning strategies The WPF with highest performance was
    selected to simulate irrigation and zoning strategies. Note that both modeling
    and simulation phases were done separately for 2013 and 2014 data. The seasonal
    irrigation level was changed from 0 to 150 mm with 10-mm increments. The optimum
    cotton lint yield maps were delineated for the three irrigation strategies including
    (i) uniform irrigation, (ii) VRI with limited sector control capability and (iii)
    a hypothetical situation in which each cell (5 × 5 m2) to be irrigated individually
    at optimum level. We adopted and modified the integer linear programing (ILP)
    optimization process developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) to find the optimum
    arrangement of management zones to maximize cotton lint yield for VRI systems
    with limited sector control capability. Each center pivot irrigation system was
    considered to consist of 360 sectors each 1 deg wide. A total of 12,241 possible
    zones were obtained by all combinations of 1 deg sectors into sectors from 1 to
    360 deg long (Table 2). Then, the optimum irrigation level to maximize cotton
    lint yield was predicted for each zone by means of k-NN WPF separately for each
    cropping season. The optimization process was formulated as follows: (4) subject
    to (5) (6) (7) where xi is the decision variable for zone i, y is the optimum
    yield per unit area predicted by k-NN WPF within zone i, n is the total number
    of the zones, l is the length of each zone in degrees, cij is a coefficient equal
    to 1 if angle j is covered by zone i otherwise equal to 0, Pmax is the maximum
    number of desired zones. Table 2. All of the sector zones that could be delineated

    cotton lint yields across the zones. Restriction (5) guarantees that each degree
    is covered only by one zone and the optimum zoning scheme covers the entire area
    underneath the center pivots. Constraint (6) keeps the total number of the zones
    less than the maximum user-defined number. Constraint (7) ensures that the length
    of the sectors is greater than the minimum user-defined (i.e. 5 degree in this
    study). If a sector was selected, the decision variable of the model, xi, was
    equal to 1 otherwise 0. 2.5. Evaluation procedure The performance of the WPFs
    was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE)
    and the correlation coefficient (r): (8) (9) (10) where Ei, and Mi are the estimated
    and the measured cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively; n is the number of
    actual cells in test/validation set; Em and Mm are the mean of estimated and the
    mean of actual cotton lint yield (Mg ha−1), respectively. 3. Results 3.1. Principal
    component analysis PCA was performed to combine and summarize the variability
    in the input attributes in Table 1 (Fig. 4). A cumulative Hotelling’s T2 was plotted
    against the number of PCs where about 96% of the inputs were explained by considering
    10 PCs, but adding more PCs did not improve nor explain most of the variability.
    Our goal was to explain at least 95% of the variability in our data set using
    selected PCs. Consequently, we used only the first 10 PCs in our WPFs. However,
    to provide an overall insight regarding performance of the PCA approach in this
    study, we only discussed the coefficient of the first two PCs in detail. Download

    by soil structure had the highest influence on PC1. On PC2, percent of clay and
    water content at FC and PWP of the shallow soil played the major role. ECa, irrigation
    and fertilizer produced medium coefficients for both PCs. The PC1 map to a great
    extent showed the expected pattern of soil physical and hydraulic properties across
    field (Fig. 4b). The PC1 negative values corresponds to soils with lower water
    holding capacity and available water content which were formed by three regions
    at the mid-east, mid-south and north west of the field. The PC1 is plotted against
    PC2 when ECa data were used to color code the points (Fig. 4, panel d). There
    was a clear distinction between (i) points with lower ECa (corresponding to coarse
    soil with lower available water content) which were skewed and clustered towards
    upper left corner of the figure and (ii) points with higher ECa (corresponding
    to fine-textured soil with higher water holding capacity) which were skewed towards
    upper right corner of the plot. The transition section at the middle of the plot
    represented soil with medium ECa, corresponding to moderate available water content.

    average RMSE as well as the standard deviation of RMSE values among 10 subsets
    of data used for model evaluation) for a range of design parameters, i.e. p and
    k. The trend was identical for both cropping seasons; the error started to decline
    as number of nearest neighbors increased, reached a minimum at k = 5, and started
    to increase again. There was almost no difference in performance of WPFs with
    different p values and k less than 4, but the WPFs with lower p values exhibited
    a higher increase in RMSE for k greater than 4. In general, the standard deviation
    of RMSE values among 10 subsets consistently decreased with increasing k from
    1 to 10 regardless of p values. The optimum parameters for k and p were equal
    to 4 and 1.5, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download

    the WPFs. Fig. 6 illustrates the estimated versus measured lint yield for both
    cropping seasons using all three WPFs. The k-NN exhibited the highest performance
    and accuracy for both 2013 and 2014 with RMSE equal to 0.131 Mg ha−1 and 0.194
    Mg ha−1, respectively, which was in agreement with well scattered cloud of points
    around 1:1 line (Fig. 6). The ANN (MLR) exhibited 60% (73%) and 52% (65%) increase
    in RMSE compared to the corresponding k-NN WPFs in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons,
    respectively. The ANN WPFs had a better performance (i.e. lower RMSE values and
    higher r) than MLR WPFs for both cropping seasons. The low MBE errors showed there
    was no systematic under/over estimation for any of the WPFs. However, both ANN
    and MLR exhibited partial over-estimation tendency for plots with yield smaller
    than 0.40 Mg ha−1 and 0.60 Mg ha−1 in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively.
    All WPFs showed a slightly better performance in 2014 in comparison with 2013
    considering the correlation coefficient and normal RMSE (i.e. RMSE divided by
    range of yield variation) as the criteria. For instance, ANN WPF had normal RMSE
    equal to 14% and 13% and r equal to 0.65 and 0.78 for 2013 and 2014 lint yield
    data, respectively. Table 3. The performance results (r = correlation coefficient,

    7 (panels a and b) shows the cotton lint yield predicted by k-NN WPF for different
    irrigation scenarios (i.e. uniform irrigation and irrigating each cell individually
    at optimum level) over the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons. Yield was lower in
    2013 than in 2014 for all irrigation levels. The predicted yield was slightly
    different between pivots, yet followed the same general trend across irrigation
    levels. We attribute this to differences in soil spatial distribution underneath
    the pivots. Given uniform irrigation scenarios, in 2013 the highest predicted
    yield was (for 110 mm seasonal IW) 1.09 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 and 0.98 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1
    for the east and west pivots, respectively. In 2013 as IW increased, there was
    a small overall increase in yield up to the maximum level (i.e. IW = 110 mm) but
    it declined after that for higher IW amounts. If each cell was irrigated at optimum
    level, yield was improved to 1.19 ± 0.05 Mg ha−1 and 1.11 ± 0.06 Mg ha−1 underneath
    east and west pivots, respectively. In 2014, there were two peaks at 20 and 120
    mm IWs. There was a sharp increase in predicted yield for small irrigation amount
    compared to rainfed situation in 2014, then it decreased and leveled off for most
    of the intermediate irrigation levels and increased again at IW = 120 mm yet continuously
    decreased after that. The highest predicted yields (IW = 20 mm) were 1.52 ± 0.12
    Mg ha−1 and 1.62 ± 0.12 Mg ha−1, underneath the east and west pivots, respectively.
    When yield in each cell was optimized with a distinct level of IW, the predicted
    yield increased to 1.71 ± 0.10 Mg ha−1 and 1.80 ± 0.09 Mg ha−1 underneath the
    east and west pivots, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (422KB)

    in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons was produced using site-specific k-NN (k-nearest
    neighbor) water production functions (WPF) in relation to multiple uniform and
    variable rate irrigation (VRI) scenarios for 2 center pivots in a 73 ha field
    in west Tennessee. Panels a and b: the dash lines with circles and triangles represent
    predicted yield under uniform irrigation for the east and west pivots, respectively.
    Individual circles and triangles above the line represent estimated yield for
    cell-based VRI scenario. Panels c and d: The dash lines with circles and triangles
    represent predicted yield for sector control VRI for the east and west pivots,
    respectively. Bars are associated with right-side y axis and represent average
    irrigation applied by each pivot. Fig. 7 (panels c and d) depicts the average
    irrigation and yield for optimum arrangement of the sectors. Yield was always
    higher in 2014 than in 2013. In both years there was a constant increase in yield
    by adding to the number of sectors, yet the highest boost occurred when pivot
    area was divided into two sectors. The yield was higher under the east pivot than
    under west pivot in 2013, but the opposite was true in 2014. In 2013, as number
    of zones increased, there was a slight reduction in optimum level of IW underneath
    the west pivot, but it remained almost constant across a different number of zones
    for the east pivot. In 2014, as the number of zones increased, higher IW was predicted
    to get the optimum yield underneath west pivot and same was true under the east
    pivot but less pronounced. Compared to rainfed agriculture, for the east pivot,
    the best uniform supplemental irrigation strategy was predicted to boost the yield
    up to 41% and 47% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. Sector control
    VRI added about 4% to the expected yield in both years. For the west pivot, compared
    to rainfed, the best uniform supplemental irrigation scenario improved the yield
    as much as 25% and 40% in 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons, respectively. The sector
    control VRI added 4% in 2013 and 7% in 2014 to the expected yield boost. Fig.
    8 illustrates the thematic yield maps predicted by k-NN WPFs for the rainfed condition
    along with multiple irrigation strategies (i.e. best uniform irrigation, cutting
    4 sectors, and irrigating each cell individually at optimum level) for the both
    pivots and cropping seasons. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) suggested four sectors as
    optimum to minimize soil spatial variation underneath the pivots. To compare the
    zoning results across the studies, we selected 4 sectors here too. By visual assessment
    of the yield maps, the biggest change occurred from rainfed to uniform irrigation
    followed by the change from sector control VRI to irrigating each cell individually.
    In 2014, the spatial yield pattern for the rainfed scenario is similar to soil
    texture maps and high resolution soil available water maps for the field of study
    illustrated and modeled by Haghverdi et al. (2015c). They showed that coarse-textured
    regions with low available water content were located in the middle, eastern and
    southwestern parts of the eastern pivot as well as in northern and northwestern
    of the western pivot. In 2013, however, it is hard to match the yield pattern
    for the rainfed scenario against soil spatial distribution, yet yield patterns
    under uniform irrigation were somewhat similar to spatial pattern of soil physical
    and hydraulic properties within the effective root zone. For both pivots and cropping
    seasons, yield predicted under sector control VRI scenario exhibited lower minimum
    but higher maximum than that for the corresponding uniform irrigation maps. Moving
    from sector control VRI into the hypothetical scenario of irrigating each 25 m2
    cell individually, yield improvement mostly occurred for cells with low expected
    yield. In other words, the maximum predicted yield remained almost unchanged but
    minimum predicted yield was substantially improved. Download : Download high-res

    16 different irrigation scenarios. On the lower right part of each map the designation
    13-W-R for example is 13 for the 2013 cropping season, W for the west center pivot,
    and R for rainfed fields. The columns are ordered by irrigation status for each
    pivot as uniform irrigation (U), sector control pie shape VRI (P), and individual
    cell (M). Fig. 9 shows the spatial arrangement of the optimum sectors from this
    study and the previous study by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). In this study, k-NN
    WPF along with ILP optimization were used to find optimum zones when the objective
    was to maximize cotton lint yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) found the best spatial
    arrangement of sector zones using ILP optimization and soil related attributes
    without considering the irrigation-yield relationships. They used soil available
    water content, soil ECa, yield data and Landsat 8 panchromatic satellite data
    when the objective was to minimize soil spatial variation within each zone. The
    spatial arrangement of optimum pie shape sectors to maximize lint yield changed
    from 2013 to 2014 for the both pivots. The 2013 zones for the east pivot were
    somewhat similar to zones by AWC and ECa data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study.
    In 2014 for the east pivot, three sectors were located on the coarse-textured
    region with low soil available water content, while a big sector covered rest
    of the pivot. There were some similarities between 2014 zones for the west pivot
    and zoning by ECa and AWC data from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. In 2013, sectors
    in northern part of the west pivot were somewhat similar to sectors from AWC data
    from Haghverdi et al. (2015b) study. The spatial arrangement of optimum zones
    using yield data (by Haghverdi et al., 2015b) was different than the configuration
    of zones in our study. Download : Download high-res image (613KB) Download : Download

    production functions The k-NN performed better than MLR and ANN in predicting
    cotton yield. It seems even dividing the field into more homogenous regions did
    not reduce the complexity enough to get the same level of accuracy by MLR WPFs
    as achieved by k-NN WPF. The ANN WPF showed a better performance than MLR, although
    we used the entire data set to train the ANN models. This is in line with the
    results reported by Haghverdi et al., 2014b, Drummond et al., 2003 who found ANN
    a better option than MLR models to predict yield. However, ANN in our study was
    not able to provide the same level of performance as k-NN WPF, meaning ANN could
    not entirely handle the huge amount of data and complex relationships between
    input and outputs. The efficiency of k-NN in our study is in line with the promising
    results reported in the literature: to model soil hydraulic properties (e.g. Nemes
    et al., 2006, Haghverdi et al., 2015a), to estimate cultivar coefficient of crop
    models (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2009) and for prediction of daily weather data
    (Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2008). In general, linear techniques are not suitable
    to model the spatial variability of crop yields (Sudduth et al., 1996), yet the
    k-NN WPF designed in our study performed satisfactory because it acts as a smart
    search engine to selects only a few similar data points for prediction. This approach
    helps k-NN WPF to take advantage of numerous data points (cells) provided by the
    yield monitoring systems without necessarily having a good approximation of the
    non-linear relationships between inputs and yield for all cells across the field
    of study. The k-NN WPF makes use of similarities to distinguish patterns instead
    of fitting coefficients and this approach could be favorable whenever the form
    of relationships between input and output of a system is not known in advance
    (Nemes et al., 2006). One should note that, k-NN WPF introduced in this study
    only provides a pseudo-continuous prediction of yield over a range of applied
    irrigation. In other words, it gives trustable results only in the neighborhood
    of measured IWs. Hence, its application for continuous prediction of yield-water
    relationship is only suggested if IW is applied at multiple levels such that the
    available data sufficiently cover the desired prediction range. We had substantial
    spatial variation of soil properties in the study field. Long-term analysis of
    yield maps for different crops revealed that the spatial variability of soil attributes
    can seriously impact crop yields (Haghverdi, 2015). Guo et al. (2012) tried to
    mathematically explain the spatial and temporal variation of cotton yield on the
    Southern High Plains of Texas by means of ECa, soil brightness, and topography
    data. They observed that these attributes together could explain up to 70.1% of
    the variability in cotton yield. Guo et al. (2012) mentioned soil texture as one
    of the greatest factor affecting cotton yield. They found a relatively stable
    spatial pattern of yield over time although yield and soil properties had stronger
    relationship in dry years than wet seasons. The results of this study showed a
    considerable impact of the spatial and temporal pattern of rainfall pattern on
    the spatial distribution of cotton yield. We realized that rainfall pattern can
    mask/change the effect of supplemental irrigation practices on yield. Receiving
    high amounts of rainfall with random temporal patterns over growing seasons is
    expected in western TN. There were 712 mm and 633 mm of rainfall over the 2013
    and 2014 growing seasons, respectively. The total seasonally applied irrigation
    water by the farmer for the east and west pivots was 133-mm and 93 mm in 2013
    and 65 mm and 50 mm in 2014, respectively. This meant that irrigation was less
    than 20% of precipitation in 2013 and less than 10% of precipitation in 2014.
    Wong and Asseng (2006) introduced interactions of seasonal rainfall, plant available
    soil water storage capacity, and N fertilizer applications as dominant factors
    causing spatiotemporal wheat yield variation. In 2013, wet soil and colder temperatures
    forced the farmer to postpone planting cotton. Furthermore, heavy rainfall throughout
    the growing season caused excessive vegetative growth and larger number of bolls
    on soils with higher available water content. We believe that planting delay caused
    an inability in cotton to accumulate adequate heat-units and delayed its maturity
    leading to a reduction in yield, especially over soils with higher water holding
    capacity, where there was not enough time for all of the bolls to open by harvesting
    time. This trend affected the yield response to irrigation which in turn caused
    slightly higher error in corresponding WPFs. Bajwa and Vories (2007) demonstrated
    that excessive irrigation in wet weather conditions decreased cotton lint yield
    in Arkansas. That is why the quantity of optimum ET required to maximize cotton
    lint yield is directly proportional to length of cropping seasons; in longer seasons,
    higher irrigation is expected to produce the highest cotton lint yield (Orgaz
    et al., 1992). The performance of site-specific WPFs may differ under different
    conditions, hence they should be tested for different crops, climatic conditions
    and the spatial variation of soils. All attributes affecting crop available water
    need to be considered for deriving site-specific WPFs. For instance, there are
    some studies reporting the positive correlation of yield with topographic attributes
    (e.g. Andales et al., 2007, Green et al., 2007). The field of study was fairly
    flat, thus we assume that coarse resolution topography and slope have negligible
    influence on cotton lint yield. However, if topography and slope impact the spatial
    distribution of water within a field they should be considered in the development
    of site-specific WPFs. 4.2. Zoning and irrigation strategies The majority of the
    farmers in west Tennessee practice uniform irrigation despite spatial variability
    in soil properties that exists in their fields. Site-specific WPFs can help them
    to move towards optimum uniform irrigation strategies for different crops and
    climatic condition. Rainfall was abundant over the course of this experiment,
    but some dry periods did occur and supplemental irrigation was crucial to fulfilling
    ET demand, especially for coarse soils with lower AWC. Thus, there was a positive
    cotton lint yield response to irrigation predicted by the use of k-NN WPFs under
    both center pivots when compared to rainfed yields. In 2013, delayed planting
    affected heat unit accumulation/distribution and maturity which in turn suppressed
    the yield across the field, while yield reduction in soils with higher available
    water was more pronounced. This was shown in WPFs prediction as a general slight
    increase in yield as IW increased. Adding more water reduced the drought stress
    for soils with lower AWC but increased overall yield until a peak point. Analysis
    of yield data showed that even for coarse-textured soils with low WHC, cotton
    yield reduction occurred due to over irrigation. That is why, a yield reduction
    was predicted by k-NN-WPF for IWs of more than 120 mm. In 2014, the overall yield-irrigation
    relationship across the field was somewhat different than that for 2013, yet closer
    to what we expected to see in most of the years. As in 2013, there was a peak
    at a high irrigation level (IW = 110 mm) which is attributed to the optimum level
    of IW for soil with lower AWC. Unlike 2013, however, in 2014 there was also a
    second peak for lower IWs which turned out to be the best uniform cotton irrigation
    strategy according to k-NN WPF predictions. This was recognized as the point of
    optimum IW level for soils with higher AWC suggesting that in a more typical year
    like 2014 (a year without delayed planting), lower irrigation for fine-textured
    soils produced higher yields that compensated for the yield reduction over water-stressed
    coarse-textured soils in different regions of the field. More years of data are
    needed to confirm this as a long-term trend. Given the spatial variability of
    soil attributes in the field, west Tennessee farmers are likely to depart from
    uniform irrigation scenarios to some type of VRI. Sector control VRI is an easier
    and less expensive irrigation strategy for those who possess center pivot irrigation
    systems. As previously stated, zone delineation for irrigation management is complex.
    Site-specific WPFs could be beneficial to support such conversion from uniform
    to sector control VRI systems, because they are useful for delineating crop-specific
    irrigation zones and for identifying the optimum irrigation strategy for each
    sector. A field is likely to have sectors with variation in soil attributes where
    real time irrigation scheduling becomes challenging. The site-specific WPFs would
    provide insights into the right soil to follow within each section to maximize
    yield. Haghverdi et al. (2015b) focused on soil properties to delineate irrigation
    management zones. We added crop yields to the optimization process by using site-specific
    WPFs. While there were some similarities between zones in this study and zones
    developed by Haghverdi et al. (2015b), the differences were more substantial both
    between years and methods. To a great extent, this difference reflected the inherent
    spatiotemporal variation associated with crop growth and yield which in turn governed
    the spatial configuration of optimum crop-based zones. According to Basso et al.
    (2009), bias in the evaluation of homogenous management zones may occur due to
    the impact of weather patterns on both crop growth and the interactions with soil
    types. We showed that the year-to-year temporal variation in rainfall patterns
    influences cotton yield-irrigation-soil relationships in west Tennessee. Farmer
    irrigation management techniques also influence the crop-based zoning result,
    because for each cropping season, the k-NN WPF only combines the available observations
    to make a new predication in that year. Therefore, it is important to look at
    the zoning system in this study as an iterative process which helps farmers to
    improve their irrigation decisions. The more a farmer improves their irrigation
    management, the better k-NN WPF predictions reflect a field’s yield potential.
    Consequently, longer experimentation is needed to see how our crop-based zoning
    strategy works across years and how different it would be from the soil-based
    zoning strategies introduced by Haghverdi et al. (2015b). Based on the k-NN WPF
    predictions, irrigating each cell individually at optimum levels would have caused
    a moderate increase in yield in 2014 and a slight increase in 2013 compared to
    the best uniform irrigation strategy. In reality, this provided a cap for the
    potential yield boost expected from a site-specific VRI. Even in 2014, the expected
    boost in yield may not be high enough to compensate for the infrastructure and
    management expenses needed to convert to a VRI system. Obviously, the benefits
    of sector control and zone control VRIs is both site and crop specific and depends
    on a variety of factors including the magnitude of soil spatial heterogeneity
    throughout the field, weather conditions, and the efficiency of real time irrigation
    scheduling (Daccache et al., 2015). 5. Conclusion Design-based statistics were
    dominant for much of the last century when contemporary constraints on data collection
    and processing prevented on-farm experimentation (Pringle et al., 2010). Nowadays,
    however, most of the farmers in US are collecting numerous site-specific data
    useful for on-site experimentation. However, the available data often have different
    spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, the observations may be spatially
    and temporally autocorrelated while also carrying inherent error and uncertainties.
    Therefore, in order to convert these data to useful information, robust algorithms
    and models are needed. We designed and evaluated site-specific WPFs. The results
    confirmed that site-specific WPFs may be powerful after-the-fact tools that are
    used by farmers to enhance future site-specific irrigation management. We used
    site-specific WPFs to evaluate different irrigation and zoning strategies. Currently,
    implementation and management of VRI systems demands high capital costs (Evans
    et al., 2013), hence it is crucial to assess the potential yield gain of zone
    control VRI over uniform and sector control VRI scenarios for each crop and a
    specific site. Our results showed that crop-based zoning using WPFs produces different
    zones based on the annual climatic conditions and farmer management practices.
    We believe a long-term data record is required that will capture different climatic
    and irrigation management scenarios that lead to stable zones. A practical option
    is to start with soil-based zoning for sector control VRI systems as proposed
    by Haghverdi et al. (2015b) and then use site-specific k-NN-WPF to improve both
    zoning and within zone irrigation decisions in an iterative process. For the study
    site and over the course of the experiment, the expected yield improvement by
    a zone control VRI system was not substantially higher than that of sector control
    VRI. Note that results will probably differ under drier conditions when greater
    yields are likely to occur under a zone control VRI compared to a sector control
    VRI. Consider that there are fundamental differences in characteristics and applications
    of the traditional CWPF/WPF and proposed site-specific WPFs in this study. Classical
    PFs are mostly derived from multiyear experiments that use research plots at different
    locations. The main goal of classical PFs is to eventually apply the established
    functions for similar places and/or for the same place in the future. Contrary
    to these studies, the site-specific WPFs that we propose are not designed to be
    used in other fields or even on the same field in different years. These WPFs
    may provide insight, but are not ready for real-time VRI scheduling and addressing
    related concerns such as runoff and deep percolation issues. The site-specific
    WPFs developed here are after-the-fact tools to simulate different irrigation
    scenarios for a given-field over a specific cropping season. They are tools to
    help farmers to monitor their irrigation management and provide a unique opportunity
    that has only become possible due to recent advances and the spread of precision
    farming equipment such as yield monitors and VRI systems. Acknowledgments This

    the irrigation runoff of the agricultural fields in the region supplies water
    to the Salton Sea lake, which means loading of chemicals in the lake is directly
    related to agriculture fertilizer and pesticide management (De Vlaming et al.,
    2004; Goodson et al., 2006; Schroeder et al., 2002). Site-specific variable rate
    application of agricultural inputs (e.g., water, fertilizer, and pesticide) has
    the potential to increase crop yields while reducing environmental contamination
    (Basso et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2020; Haghverdi et al., 2016; Sanchez et al.,
    2017); however, their potential adoption rate and benefit in the desert agriculture
    region of southern California are still unclear. The first steps toward the adoption
    of variable rate technologies are to find the most relevant information that can
    address the within-field variability, know how to process or classify the data,
    delineate management zones (MZs) and identify the optimum number of zones in a

  analysis: "The work under assessment primarily concerns the design of an optimized\
    \ interface aimed at enhancing both situational awareness and workload management\
    \ for operators who oversee multi-robot systems engaged in surveillance and extinguishing\
    \ of fires. The research team emphasizes the benefits of an immersive Virtual\
    \ Reality (VR) interface, comparing it to more traditional, non-immersive interfaces.\
    \ \n\nThe most significant contribution is the system of predictive components\
    \ integrated into the interface, which seek to identify and prioritize details\
    \ relevant to the operator. To facilitate this prioritization, the VR interface\
    \ employs a spotlight which follows the most relevant drone and encircles potentially\
    \ endangered UAVs with a smoke cloud.\n\nThe results of the study suggest that\
    \ immersive interfaces improve the situational awareness of operators without\
    \ imposing additional burdens on their attentional resources or increasing their\
    \ workload. Specifically, the predictive components integrated into the VR interface\
    \ were found to be particularly effective in improving situational awareness for\
    \ operators. \n\nThe study's limitations include: \n\n1. Limited sample size:\
    \ The study was conducted with a small number of participants, which may limit\
    \ the generalizability of the findings. \n2. Lack of control group: The study\
    \ did not include a control group of participants who used a non-immersive interface\
    \ without predictive components. This makes it difficult to determine whether\
    \ the improvements in situational awareness observed with the immersive interface\
    \ were due to the immersive nature of the interface, the predictive components,\
    \ or a combination of both factors.\n\nFuture research could address these limitations\
    \ by conducting a larger study with a control group and varying the types of immersive\
    \ and non-immersive interfaces, as well as the types of predictive components\
    \ used."

    Abstract: Multi-robot missions are a challenge for operators in terms of workload
    and situational

    awareness. These operators have to receive data from the robots, extract information,
    understand

    the situation properly, make decisions, generate the adequate commands, and send
    them to

    the robots. The consequences of excessive workload and lack of awareness can vary
    from inefﬁciencies

    to accidents. This work focuses on the study of future operator interfaces of
    multi-robot systems,

    taking into account relevant issues such as multimodal interactions, immersive
    devices, predictive

    capabilities and adaptive displays. Speciﬁcally, four interfaces have been designed
    and developed:

    a conventional, a predictive conventional, a virtual reality and a predictive
    virtual reality interface.

    The four interfaces have been validated by the performance of twenty-four operators
    that supervised

    eight multi-robot missions of ﬁre surveillance and extinguishing. The results
    of the workload and

    situational awareness tests show that virtual reality improves the situational
    awareness without

    increasing the workload of operators, whereas the effects of predictive components
    are not signiﬁcant

    and depend on their implementation.

    1. Introduction

    Multi-robot missions have experienced a noticeable growth over the last decades.
    Their performance

    has been improved significantly, and their range of application has been extended.
    Currently, these missions

    are applied in multiple domains (air, ground and sea) for diverse purposes (surveillance,
    search and rescue,

    environmental monitoring...).

    The control and monitoring of these kind of missions causes a series of problems
    related to human

    factors. Table 1 collects some of these issues, as well as the consequences for
    the mission, the procedures

    to detect them, and the actions to compensate them. According to [1], the most
    relevant problems

    in scenarios with multiple robots and single operator are peaks of workload and
    lack of situational

    awareness. According to [2], the use of robots in urban search and rescue scenarios
    has a bottleneck in

    situational awareness, which can be addressed by considering the robots as sources
    of information

    and fusing this information properly.

    Train operators

    Workload can be deﬁned as the sum of the amount of work, the working time and
    the subjective

    experience of the operator [3]. However, the study of workload usually takes into
    account multiple

    attributes (input load, operator effort and work performance) [4] and dimensions
    (physical and mental

    demand) [5].

    The operators of multi-robot missions have to perceive information, understand
    the situation,

    make decisions and generate commands. In this context, excessive workload can
    lead to an increase of

    waiting times, errors in decision making and, therefore, a decrease in mission
    performance [6].

    The most common method to determine the workload of a mission is the NASA Task
    Load Index

    (NASA-TLX) [5]. This method uses a questionnaire where the operators can perform
    a subjective

    evaluation of their workload by answering a set of questions. In the ﬁrst part
    of the questionnaire,

    the operators compare some variables according to their inﬂuence on workload:
    mental demand

    (low–high), physical demand (low–high), temporal demand (low–high), performance
    (good–poor),

    effort (low–high) and frustration (low–high). In the second one, they rate these
    variables regarding their

    experience during the mission. The results of 20 years of experiments with NASA-TLX
    questionnaire

    have been summarized in a more recent publication [7].

    Situational awareness can be deﬁned as the perception of elements in the environment
    within

    a volume of time and space (level 1), the comprehension of their meaning (level
    2), and the projection

    of their status in the near future (level 3) [8].

    The operators of multi-robot missions have to know not only the location and state
    of the robots

    in the scenarios, but also their meaning in the mission and their potential evolution
    in the near future.

    In fact, the consequences of a lack of situational awareness are diverse: from
    operator mistakes to

    robot accidents.

    The most common method to estimate situational awareness is the Situational Awareness
    Global

    Assessment Technique (SAGAT) [9]. This method provides an objective measurement
    and works in

    the following manner:

    1.

    The operator is watching a simulation of a multi-robot mission.

    2.

    At a certain time of the mission, the simulation is stopped and the interface
    is blanked.

    3.

    The operator is asked a series of questions about the situation.

    4.

    After the end of the mission, the real and perceived situations are compared.

    5.

    A score is determined in three zones (immediate, intermediate and long-range).

    As shown in Table 1, some of the potential solutions for human factor problems
    in multi-robot

    missions are related to operator interfaces. Some examples are: the reduction
    of workload, by adjusting

    the level of autonomy of the system, or transferring functions from operator to
    interface; and the

    improvement of situational awareness, by taking advantage of immersion, or selecting
    the most

    relevant information at all times.

    This paper analyzes the best-suited operator interfaces for multi-robot systems.
    On one hand,

    the main interface design resources have been studied: multimodal interactions
    (transmission

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    3 of 25

    of information through audio and vibration), immersive devices (use of commercial
    virtual

    reality headsets), predictive capabilities (application of neural networks to
    discover information)

    and adaptive displays (selection of the most relevant information). On the other
    hand, four interfaces

    have been developed: a conventional (CI), a predictive conventional (PCI), a virtual
    reality (VRI) and

    a predictive virtual reality (PVRI) interface. Finally, the four interfaces have
    been used by a set of

    operators to monitor a series of multi-robot missions, and their performance has
    been evaluated by

    means of workload and situational awareness tests.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 collects the state of
    the art about

    operator interfaces for robotic systems, focusing on the proposals of multimodal,
    immersive and

    adaptive interfaces.

    Section 3 describes the multi-robot missions used to design, develop and

    validate the interfaces. Section 4 addresses the virtual reality and prediction
    resources used in

    the interfaces.

    Section 5 gives a detailed description of the four interfaces developed by the

    authors. Section 6 addresses the design of the experiments performed to validate
    the interfaces.

    Section 7 discusses the results of the workload and situational awareness tests
    performed in the

    experiments. And ﬁnally, Section 8 summarizes the main conclusions of the work.

    2. State of Art

    Interfaces are a key element in multi-robot missions, since they manage the interactions
    between

    operators and robots. They are inﬂuential not only in the discovery and display
    of information, but also

    in the generation and transmission of commands. Table 2 compares the interfaces
    developed in this

    work with a diverse set of interfaces extracted from recent literature.

    This chapter analyzes different types of operator interfaces for multi-robot missions.
    Section 2.1

    addresses multimodal interfaces, Section 2.2 describes immersive interfaces, Section
    2.3 is focused on

    adaptive interfaces and, ﬁnally, Section 2.4 collects a set of design guidelines.

    2.1. Multimodal Interfaces

    Multimodal interfaces integrate not only conventional interactions (visual), but
    also non-conventional

    ones (aural, tactile...) for the transmission of information and generation of
    commands. Some of the

    most common problems of robot operation (limited field of view, degraded depth
    perception, orientation

    problems, time delays...) can be addressed by developing multimodal interfaces
    [20].

    On one hand, multimodal displays can improve operator performance by complementing
    the

    visual information, or drawing the user’s attention to certain variables. The
    combination of visual and

    aural spatial information leads to the enhancement of situational awareness [21].
    Haptic interactions

    can be applied in visual interfaces to draw the operator’s attention to the warnings
    and their

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    locations [22]. Although the inﬂuence of visual, aural and haptic feedbacks on
    the spatial ability

    of operator is signiﬁcant, their effects in teleoperation performance are still
    unclear [23].

    On the other hand, multimodal commands offer even more possibilities than multimodal
    displays.

    The idea is to combine voice, touch and gestures to reach simple, natural and
    fast interactions between

    operators and robots [24]. There are multiple approaches to command multi-robot
    missions by means

    of speech commands [25]. In addition to this, gesture commands can be employed
    in this context,

    developing not only hand gestures [26], but also combinations of face poses and
    hand gestures [27].

    All virtual reality interfaces designed for this research (VRI and PVRI) include
    multimodal displays.

    Speciﬁcally, the sounds of the robots and their environment and the vibration
    of the controllers are used

    to support the situational awareness of operators. Since the objective of the
    study is mission monitoring

    and not robot commanding, multimodal commands have not been included in the interfaces.

    2.2. Immersive Interfaces

    Immersive interfaces seek to introduce the operator into the mission scenario.
    For this purpose,

    they take advantage of multiple technologies (e.g., 3D or 2D cameras, and virtual
    or augmented

    reality glasses). The objective is to reproduce the scenario in detail, and improve
    the situational

    awareness of the operator. There are two main types of immersive interfaces: augmented
    reality (AR)

    and virtual reality (VR).

    Augmented reality combines videos streamed by the robots with relevant information
    about

    the mission: e.g., maps, terrain elevation, obstacles, robot paths, target locations
    and other data [28].

    Multiple experiments show the potential of AR in the context of multi-robot missions.
    For instance,

    an experiment that compared conventional and AR video stream showed that participants
    ﬁnd

    an increased number of targets more accurately with the support of AR [29]. Further
    works include

    maps with 3D printouts of the terrain, where multiple live video streams replace
    robot representations,

    and with the possibility of drawing the robots’ paths [30].

    Virtual reality integrates representations of both real and virtual elements,
    such as robots, targets,

    paths and threats, in order to improve the situational awareness of operators.
    A comparison among

    multiple displays in the context of multi-UAV missions pointed out that VR glasses
    could improve the

    spatial knowledge of operators at the expense of increasing their workload [16].
    The aim of the present

    work is to go further than this study, looking for quantitative and signiﬁcant
    conclusions in terms of

    situational awareness and workload.

    Mixed reality is a combination of AR And VR that searches to create new scenarios
    where users

    can interact with both real and virtual objects. Although the application of this
    technology to immersive

    interfaces looks promising, there is a lack of guidelines for development or cases
    of use.

    For the sake of this research, two virtual reality interfaces (VRI and PVRI) have
    been designed,

    developed and validated. These interfaces not only reproduce the scenario, robots
    and targets, but also

    display relevant information about the mission.

    2.3. Adaptive Interfaces

    Adaptive interfaces seek to provide agents with information required for making
    decisions

    and executing actions; while improving their speed, accuracy, understanding, coordination
    and

    workload [31]. For this purpose, they integrate data mining and machine learning
    algorithms, able to

    perform operator functions, discover relevant information, and support their decisions.

    Several papers found in literature collect guidelines to design intelligent adaptive
    interfaces

    (IAIs) [32]. Adaption requires various types of models (knowledge, operators,
    robots, tasks, world...)

    to manage information about the missions. Moreover, the adaption process should
    cover four steps:

    knowledge acquisition (what is happening?), attention (what adaptation is going
    to occur?), reasoning

    (why is it necessary?) and decision making (how is it happening?).

    From the interfaces that have been designed for this work, two integrate predictive

    components: one of the conventional interfaces (PCI) and one of the virtual reality
    interfaces (PRVI).

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    5 of 25

    These components showcase relevant information about the mission extracted from
    vehicle telemetry,

    a task usually performed by operators. Speciﬁcally, neural networks have been
    applied to accomplish

    the information-extracting task, theoretically reducing the operators’ workload.

    2.4. Design Guidelines

    This section attempts to answer the question “How should a good multi-robot interface
    be?”.

    For this purpose, a review of interface literature has been carried out and design
    guidelines have

    been collected. The main hardware and software requirements obtained from this
    review are collected

    in Table 3.

    3. Multi-Robot Missions

    A set of multi-robot missions were used in order to evaluate the four interfaces
    (non-predictive and

    predictive conventional and non-predictive and predictive virtual reality interfaces).
    These missions

    were carried out at the laboratory of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security,
    Reliability and Trust (SnT)

    of the University of Luxembourg in April 2016 [39]. However, as shown in Figure
    1, the interface tests

    took place at the laboratory of Robotics and Cybernetics Group (RobCib) of the
    Technical University

    of Madrid (UPM) in April 2017. The missions were reproduced successfully with
    the aid of stored

    telemetry and commands, together with video recordings of every session.

    The missions’ aim was to control two aerial robots that alternatively performed
    tasks of

    detecting-extinguishing ﬁres, and ﬁnding-following intruders.

    The scenario was set up in a

    5.35 m × 6.70 m × 5.00 m room with a robot base, a water well and a ﬁre with variable
    locations.

    The UAVs had to perform the following tasks to accomplish the mission:

    •

    Begin: The robot switches on and takes-off.

    •

    Surveillance: The robot ﬂies over an area at high altitude with a back and forth
    pattern to ﬁnd

    potential ﬁres.

    •

    Reconnaissance: The robot ﬂies over a list of points at low altitude to check
    the previously

    detected ﬁres.

    •

    Capture: The robot ﬂies to the reservoir, descends and loads water.

    •

    Release: The robot ﬂies to the ﬁre, ascends and discharges water over it.

    •

    Go to WP: The robot ﬂies to a waypoint with other purposes: e.g., to leave free
    the way of the

    other robot.

    •

    Tracking: The robot follows the suspect across the scenario at low altitude.

    •

    Finish: The robot lands and switches off.

    Two Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 UAVs [40] and a KUKA Youbot [41] UGV were employed to
    perform

    the missions. The aerial robots were operated through an interface; whereas the
    ground robot was

    considered as a target for detection and tracking and, therefore, was out of control
    for the UAV operator.

    Figure 1. Multi-robot missions performed in Luxembourg in 2016 and virtually reproduced
    in Madrid

    in 2017.

    A motion capture system Optitrack was used to get the accurate position and orientation
    of aerial

    and ground robots [42]. This system was able to capture and track the robots around
    the scenario with

    a series of infrared cameras together with a set of reﬂective markers attached
    to the robots.

    All hardware and software components of the missions, including the robots, motion
    capture

    system and operator interface, were integrated by means of the Robot Operating
    System (ROS)

    open-source framework [43].

    The aerial robots rendered a full telemetry record that consisted of state; position
    and orientation

    estimations based on visual odometry; angular and linear velocities and accelerations
    based on

    IMU readings; battery level; and motor voltage. Additionally, the motion capture
    system provided

    accurate readings of the positions and orientations of the aerial and ground robots.
    Finally, the user

    interface allowed the operator to send commands with the robot tasks referenced
    in real time. All this

    information was stored for future use in ROS bag ﬁles, as well as XLSX spreadsheets.

    4. Resources

    This chapter analyzes the main two resources used in the interfaces: the predictive
    component,

    which is described in Section 4.1, and the virtual reality, which is detailed
    in Section 4.2.

    4.1. Predictive Component

    As stated above, multi-robot missions pose a series of challenges to human operators,
    including

    the management of workload and the preservation of situational awareness. As shown
    in Figure 2,

    operators using conventional interfaces must receive data, discover information,
    make decisions,

    generate commands and send them. A potential solution to relieve this workload
    is to transfer

    functions from the operator to the interface. Speciﬁcally, the idea behind this
    work is to assign the

    discovery of information to the interface instead of the operator.

    An interesting related work can be found in [44], whose goal is to provide robots
    with human

    capabilities to perceive, understand and avoid the risks during their missions.
    For this purpose,

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    7 of 25

    the author studies human perception, cognition and reaction against risks and
    develops a framework

    to apply these concepts to ﬂeets of aerial robots.

    Figure 2.

    Contribution of prediction to interfaces.

    (upper) The operators of non-predictive

    interfaces have to receive data, ﬁnd information, make decisions, generate commands
    and send

    them. (lower) Predictive interfaces can help the operators performing some functions
    such as the

    discovery of information.

    The amount of data generated by a multi-robot mission depends on the number and
    complexity

    of robots and tasks. This raw data includes robot states (position, orientation,
    speed, battery...) and

    payloads (measurements of sensors, images of cameras, state of actuators...).
    When the amount of data

    is exceedingly large, operators may ﬁnd themselves unable to process everything
    in order to extract

    the most relevant parts. Therefore, they might remain oblivious to information
    such as which task is

    more critical, which robot requires more attention, which situation has more risks...

    A proposed solution to this matter is to automatically determine what information
    is important

    from the raw data of mission. For this purpose, all instances of data generated
    by the mission

    are considered input variables, and the problem is simpliﬁed by selecting three
    output variables:

    the task, relevance and risk of each robot at any moment of the mission. Current
    and next tasks

    are determined by using Petri nets and decision trees respectively, following
    methods developed

    in previous publications [45,46]. Relevance and risk are determined through a
    manual procedure

    with four steps: evaluation of human operator, preparation of datasets, neural
    network training and

    subsequent validation.

    Let’s start with variable deﬁnitions:

    •

    Relevance. This variable measures the importance of the robot in a certain situation
    of the mission.

    In this work, it is considered as a percentage, which varies from 0% (i.e., the
    robot is not involved

    in the mission) to 100% (i.e., it is the unique one that is taking part in the
    mission). The sum of the

    relevances of all the robots that take part in the mission must be 100%.

    •

    Risk. This variable measures the potential danger that the robot can suffer in
    a certain situation of

    the mission. In this work, it is considered as a percentage, which varies from
    0% (i.e., the robot

    is completely safe) to 100% (i.e., it has suffered an accident). In this case,
    the risk of one robot is

    independent of the risks of the rest of the ﬂeet.

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    8 of 25

    The ﬁrst step of the predictive component development consists of an operator
    evaluating the

    relevance and risk of the robots during missions: watching mission videos and
    noting their values

    over time. This evaluation was performed with sixteen missions: eight for training
    and eight for

    validation. Some of the operator criteria for the evaluation of relevance and
    risk are shown in Figure 3.

    On one hand, a robot’s relevance is related to the task that it is performing,
    together with every possible

    anomaly and problem. On the other hand, a robot’s risk is inﬂuenced by factors
    such as its proximity

    to obstacles or other robots. However, it must be remarked that the evaluation
    is not deterministic,

    since the operator can provide different outputs for similar inputs.

    Figure 3. Approximation of evaluation criteria of operator for robot relevance
    and risk.

    The second step of the procedure involves dataset preparation. The result is a
    series of spreadsheet

    with an average of 590 readings whose columns are the mission variables and whose
    rows are

    their values at different timestamps. Mission data includes 101 variables that
    can be classiﬁed as

    primary variables (60 variables collected by telemetry, such as the position,
    orientation, battery...),

    secondary variables (37 variables that are obtained by operating with them, such
    as the task, distance

    between robots...), and target variables (relevance and risk of all the robots).
    These latter variables

    were subjected to a correlation test: showing absolute inverse correlation between
    relevances and low

    correlations between the rest of variables (0.594 between risks, ±0.178 and ±0.395
    between relevances

    and risks).

    In third place, neural networks are trained using the operator’s evaluation of
    risk and relevance.

    For this purpose, the eight training datasets above mentioned were used, and a
    back propagation

    algorithm was implemented in RapidMiner Studio 7.5. A total of sixteen NNs have
    been generated:

    four NNs (1, 2, 3 and 4 hidden layers) for the four variables (robot 1 and robot
    2 relevance and risk).

    Finally, the fourth step of the procedure involves NN validation with the eight
    validation datasets.

    Figure 4 shows the mean and standard deviation of the NN variable prediction errors.
    It can be

    appreciated that relevance implies greater errors than risk, probably due to the
    nature of these variables:

    the ﬁrst one oscillates from 0% to 100% with an average of 50%, whereas the second
    one is usually

    under 20% and presents some peaks. NNs with four hidden layers have been chosen
    because they

    obtain the best results with three of four variables: both risks and the relevance
    of robot 2. The Figure 5

    shows the real and predicted values for the four variables, as well as the absolute
    error for these

    variables. As shown, the NNs predict successfully the trends of the variables
    (i.e., rise and fall), but

    they are often unable to reach the peaks, explaining the errors above mentioned.

    The comparison among the errors of NNs with training and validation datasets reveals

    a phenomenon of overﬁtting. Speciﬁcally, the errors with training dataset are
    5 times lower than

    with validation one. However, the interfaces do not use directly the values of
    relevances and risks,

    but thresholds for these variables. For instance, when the relevance of an UAV
    is higher than the other

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    9 of 25

    UAV, the interfaces select this UAV, or when the risks of an UAV are over 50%,
    the interfaces show

    an alert. In this case, the total error of NNs including both false positives
    and false negatives is 7.64%

    (11.55% in UAV 1 relevance, 5.1% in UAV 1 risk, 12.28% in UAV 2 relevance and
    1.6% in UAV 2 risk).

    This result is considered as adequate for the correct work of interfaces.

    4.2. Virtual Reality

    The development over the last decade of increasingly immersive systems has provided
    interface

    designers with new tools for improving robot operating missions. The range of
    VR headsets available

    in the market [47] , shown in Table 4, can be divided in two broad categories:
    tethered and mobile.

    Mobile headsets are not able to offer the performance level required for robot
    operation. They solely

    consist of lenses that divide a mobile phone screen into two separate images,
    and current mobile

    phones cannot offer enough performance level for high end VR applications. Oculus
    Rift and HTC

    Vive are the most convenient options for software development, as they are compatible
    with game

    engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine 4. This paper addresses an interface designed
    for HTC Vive

    using Unity.

    The HTC Vive virtual reality headset was originally conceived for recreational
    purposes, but its

    versatility promotes applications beyond gaming. This system offers both seated
    and room scale virtual

    reality. The basic elements of the system are shown in Figure 6. The head-mounted
    display (HMD) uses

    one screen per eye, with a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a resolution of 1080 × 1200.
    An audio jack permits

    the addition of sound to create a full immersion in the virtual environment. The
    tracking system

    involves two light-emitting base stations and photosensors embedded in the HMD
    and controllers.

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    11 of 25

    This system is commonly referred as Lighthouse tracking (where the base stations
    are the lighthouses),

    and offers a sub-millimeter precision and a system latency of 22 ms [48]. This
    last feature is remarkable,

    as latency is one of the primary factors that cause motion sickness and dizziness
    when wearing

    an HMD system [49]. Additional sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers and
    a front-facing camera

    that can be used avoid obstacles within the play area.

    Figure 6. HTC Vive headset and controller.

    The placement of the lighthouses delimits an area of approximately 4.6 m by 4.6
    m where

    the user can move freely, with an accurate tracking of rotation and translation,
    together with

    controller movement. Nevertheless, some applications encourage the use of some
    sort of teleporting

    system within the VR space. Teleporting can be implemented through the Vive controllers.
    The HTC

    Vive set includes two controllers with trackpads, trigger buttons and grip buttons
    that allow

    interactions with virtual objects. A basic diagram of the controller elements
    is shown in Figure 6.

    These simple and intuitive interactions entail a wide array of potential robot
    operating commands

    without the need for any additional devices. Furthermore, the controllers open
    the door for haptic

    feedback, as various degrees of vibration can be implemented under certain circumstances.

    HTC Vive allows a straightforward interface development through Unity and the
    Steam VR

    plugin, which handles all connections between the computer and headset. When modeling
    a scenario

    in virtual reality it is important to consider the scale in order to facilitate
    its navigation. If its size is

    close to the play area’s size, the scenario can be depicted using a 1:1 scale;
    but larger scenarios, such as

    those of outdoor missions, should include options such as bird’s eye view. The
    possibility of a ﬁrst

    person view, attaching the camera to a moving robot, has been discarded, as it
    most certainly causes

    virtual reality sickness [50].

    One of the advantages of virtual reality, the possibility to reproduce a real
    scenario, poses

    an additional challenge when used to portray information within the scene. Non-VR
    interfaces

    usually resort to non-diegetic elements, which are not part of the scene per se,
    but make sense to the

    operator in the context of their mission. Some examples of non-diegetic elements
    are mission time,

    battery percentage, mission state or current command. When creating a VR scene,
    non-diegetic

    elements attached to the screen could block the operator’s view and be extremely
    unpractical.

    The VR-friendly alternative is the use of diegetic user interface elements. These
    elements generate

    an output that can be attached to objects within the game, such as walls (e.g.,
    a sign pointing out the

    name of an area within the scene), or mobile elements (e.g., battery levels attached
    to UAVs) [51] .

    5. Design of Interfaces

    This chapter describes with detail the four interfaces that have been developed:
    non-predictive

    conventional interface (CI) in Section 5.1, predictive conventional interface
    (PCI) in Section 5.2,

    non-predictive virtual reality interface (VRI) in Section 5.3, and predictive
    virtual reality interface

    (PVRI) in Section 5.4.

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    5.1. Non-Predictive Conventional Interface

    This interface is based on the one used to perform the experiments and described
    in a previous

    work [39]. This interface is shown in Figure 7 and consists of the following panels
    (from top-left to

    down-right): map, commanding, conﬁguration, robot and payload. As the experiments
    involved

    mission monitoring but not robot commanding, some panels and some options were
    not used,

    mainly the related to commands and payloads.

    Figure 7. Conventional interface without the predictive component.

    The map panel shows a scheme of the scenario with its main elements (center, water
    ...),

    the location of both UAVs, and the location of ﬁre and UGV when they are discovered.
    Under

    the map there is a button for each UAV that the user can click to select it. The
    robot panel shows the

    full information of the selected UAV, such as the level of battery, altitude,
    horizontal and vertical speed

    and task that is performing. Finally, the conﬁguration panel was used to connect
    the interface to the

    telemetry, deﬁne the mode (manual in CI and automatic in PCI) and perform the
    stops and starts.

    5.2. Predictive Conventional Interface

    This interface is similar to the previous one, but it includes predictions to
    support operators.

    As mentioned previously, the predictive elements are the relevance and the risk
    of the UAVs during

    the mission. The relevance of UAVs was integrated by automatically selecting the
    most relevant UAV,

    instead of asking the operator to select it. The risk of UAVs was integrated by
    means of an indicator in

    the robot panel, as well as an alert sign in the map when it exceeds the 25% (as
    shown in Figure 8).

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    Figure 8. Conventional interface with predictive component.

    5.3. Non-Predictive Virtual Reality Interface

    The non-predictive virtual reality interface is based on the Luxembourg experiment
    scenario, with

    a full scale representation of all its elements. Figure 9 shows a screen capture
    of the interface, and will

    be used to describe its main features. There is a basic scenario with static elements:
    the ﬂoor, with the

    same design as the conventional interface background—to provide spatial references
    for the user;

    the glass walls, that mark out the working area; and the water well, which can
    also be used as an

    orientation reference. An observation platform was included to offer the user
    an additional viewpoint

    for mission monitoring.

    The dynamic interface elements are the two UAVs, the UGV and the ﬁres, together
    with the HTC

    Vive controls. Both UAVs are able to ﬂy according to the mission they are performing,
    with realistic

    rotor movement and sound. The attached audio source plays in loop a recorded drone
    hovering sound,

    which can be used to detect their proximity when they are out of view. The two
    UAVs are equipped

    with a translucent screen in which the battery state and name of the task in performance
    can be checked

    easily. The battery state bar interpolates its hue between the extreme values
    of RGB green and red to

    give an intuitive idea of the battery level. These screens were animated to always
    face the headset

    camera, so that the information in them is accesible at all times.

    When a mission is played, both the UGV and ﬁre remain hidden until the moment
    of their

    detection. Whereas each mission is associated with a ﬁxed ﬁre spawning point,
    the UGV translates

    and rotates according to the recorded telemetry data from the real missions. The
    spawning times for

    both the UGV and ﬁre have been determined after examining the mission data log.

    Although some walking is allowed with the HTC Vive headset in room scale mode,
    the interface

    presents teleporting as the main way to navigate the scene. The teleporting scenario
    is conﬁned within

    the working area, delimited by glass walls. When the user presses either of the
    Vive controller triggers,

    a parabola comes out of them. Haptic interactions are used to encourage the user
    to use teleportation.

    The parabola color, green or red, differentiates between the teleporting and forbidden
    areas. In order

    to facilitate access to the observation platform, there are two teleporting points
    in the wall where it is

    attached, as can be seen in Figure 10.

    Figure 10. Teleport to ﬂoor (left) and observation platform (right).

    5.4. Predictive Virtual Reality Interface

    The predictive virtual reality interface maintains the same elements from the
    non-predictive

    version, and adds the predictive component with two new elements that symbolize
    risk and relevance.

    There is a spotlight that follows the most relevant drone at every point of the
    mission, giving hints

    to the operator about where to look. As for risk, when a risk factor above the
    threshold is detected,

    a smoke cloud like the one shown in Figure 11 surrounds the endangered UAV.

    6. Experiments

    A series of experiments were carried out to measure the impact of immersion and
    prediction

    in multi-robot mission monitoring. For this purpose, operators used four interfaces
    integrating the

    previously mentioned resources to monitor multi-robot missions, as shown in Figure
    12.

    Figure 12. Testing virtual reality interfaces. (left) An operator working hard
    in real world. (right) What

    the operator is doing in virtual world.

    A total of 24 subjects of different age, genre and expertise were involved in
    the experiments.

    Speciﬁcally, the participants’ age ranged from 21 to 34 years old, there were
    9 women and 15 men

    and their expertise was classiﬁed according to their study level: BSc students
    (16), MSc students (2),

    PhD students (5) and PhD (1). The participants were also asked about their experience
    with videogames

    and robot missions in a scale from 0 (never) to 5 (work/hobby).

    Each participant used two different interfaces to monitor two different missions.
    The assignation

    and order of interfaces and missions were planned to compensate the inﬂuence of
    a learning curve

    on results, as well as to avoid the dependencies between interfaces and missions.
    In order to explain

    the design of experiments, the Table 5 shows the interfaces and missions assigned
    to each participant.

    This design of experiments provides with 24 samples to compare CIs and VRIs, and
    6 samples to

    compare the pairs CI vs VRI, CI vs PVRI, PCI vs VRI and PCI vs PVRI. In the ﬁrst
    case, this ﬁgure

    allows to make conclusions with a statistical conﬁdence level of 95% and a statistical
    power of 30%.

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    16 of 25

    In the second one, the number of samples could be not enough to reach signiﬁcant
    conclusions, but the

    cost of increasing signiﬁcantly the number of participants or the number of interfaces
    per participant

    was not affordable.

    We used

    the NASA-TLX and SAGAT questionnaires in Spanish to obtain values for these variables.

    The structure of one of the 24 experiments is detailed below:

    1.

    Explanation of missions:

    •

    The objective of the experiment is to watch multi-robot missions, collect information
    and

    answer a series of questions.

    •

    The goals of the missions are to detect and extinguish ﬁres, and to ﬁnd and track

    potential intruders.

    •

    The mission elements are two drones (one red and another blue), a ground robot,
    a ﬁre and

    a water well.

    •

    The drones perform the following tasks: begin (take-off), surveillance (cover
    the area to

    detect ﬁre or intruder), reconnaissance (visit the points to check detections),
    tracking (follow

    an intruder), capture (load the water), release (download on ﬁre) and ﬁnish (land).

    •

    It is important to know where the drones are, what tasks they are performing,
    their battery

    level, etc.

    2.

    Explanation of interfaces:

    •

    Conventional interface (CI): The map, the elements (UAVs, ﬁre and UGV), the manual

    selection of UAV and the information (battery and task).

    •

    Predictive conventional interface (PCI): The map, the elements (UAVs, ﬁre and
    UGV),

    the predictive components (spotlight and alert), the autonomous selection of UAV
    and the

    information (battery and task).

    Annotation of user information: Age, genre and expertise.

    4.

    NASA-TLX (weighing): The user puts into order six variables (mental, physical
    and temporal

    demands, effort, performance and frustration) according to their estimated inﬂuence
    on workload

    (as seen in Figure 13).

    5.

    Test of interface #1:

    •

    Start: The user starts to monitor the multi-robot mission.

    •

    Stop #1: We notify the user and, after ten seconds, stop the interface.

    •

    SAGAT (ﬁrst part): The user answers some questions about the past, current and
    future

    locations and states of UAVs. The questionnaire is explained in further detail
    below.

    •

    Resume: The user starts again to monitor the multi-robot mission.

    •

    SAGAT (second part):The user answers some questions about the past, current and
    future

    locations and states of UAVs. The questionnaire is explained in further detail
    below.

    6.

    Test of interface #2: The same procedure applied in interface #1.

    7.

    NASA-TLX (scoring): The user evaluates both interfaces according to six variables
    (mental,

    physical and temporal demands, effort, performance and frustration) and marks
    values from 0

    to 20 (as shown in Figure 13).

    8.

    Annotation of user observations.

    NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX): English translation of the questionnaire of

    the experiments.

    As mentioned in the experiment layout, missions were stopped twice to pass the
    SAGAT

    questionnaire. The ﬁrst stops were after 1 to 2 min of mission, whereas the second
    ones were after

    2 or 3 min. Along each one of these stops, the participants had to answer 10 questions.
    Five of these

    questions were ﬁxed: the locations of UAVs, their past and future evolution and
    the tasks they were

    performing. The rest of the questions depended on the mission and included the
    perceived distance

    from UAVs to ﬁre, water or UGV, battery levels of UAVs, which UAV discovered ﬁre
    or UGV, etc.

    An example is shown in Figure 14.

    7. Results

    This chapter presents the results of the previously stated experiments. Table
    6 summarizes

    the average workload and situational awareness scores per interface obtained from
    the NASA-TLX

    and SAGAT questionnaires respectively. Additionally, this table shows the positive
    and negative

    user reviews. A quick analysis of the means show that immersive interfaces are
    better than their

    conventional counterparts in terms of workload and situational awareness, whereas
    the effects of

    the predictive components depend on the interface (conventional or virtual reality)
    and the variable

    (workload or situational awareness). These results and their statistical relevance
    are discussed in the

    following sections.

    7.1. Workload

    As shown in Table 6, the interfaces can be arranged by means of increasing workload
    as follows:

    VRI, PVRI, CI and PCI. This order points out that virtual reality interfaces tend
    to reduce operator

    workload, whereas the predictive components tend to increase it. Nevertheless,
    these results could be

    inﬂuenced by the procedure and not be statistically signiﬁcant.

    In order to check the statistical signiﬁcance, the results have been split according
    to the workload

    variables (mental, physical and temporal demand, effort, performance, and frustration)
    and the

    interfaces (on one hand, CI vs. PCI vs. VRI vs. PVRI, and, on the other hand,
    CI and PCI vs. VRI

    and PVRI).

    Figure 15a shows box and whisker diagrams of the workload and its variables for
    the

    four interfaces. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the complete dataset
    shows there

    are no signiﬁcant differences between the workload of the four interfaces (F =
    2.26, p = 0.1061). Similar

    studies for the variables of workload show there are signiﬁcant differences with
    α = 0.05 in performance

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    19 of 25

    (F = 2.59, p = 0.065) and frustration (F = 3.37, p = 0.0266), while these differences
    do not apply to the

    remaining variables.

    Figure 15b shows the same diagrams for the interfaces now grouped in two blocks:
    conventional

    and virtual reality. The one-way ANOVA of this dataset shows there are signiﬁcant
    difference with

    α = 0.05 between the workload of both groups of interfaces (F = 5.58, p = 0.0225).
    Similar studies

    for workload variables keep these signiﬁcant differences in effort (F = 4.54,
    p = 0.0384), performance

    (F = 7.56, p = 0.0085) and frustration (F = 8.47, p = 0.0055). Once again, these
    differences do not apply

    to the other three variables.

    (VRI) and Predictive

    and Virtual

    Reality (VRIs).

    Finally, the t-test for each pair of interfaces provides the results of Table
    7. It can be appreciated

    that, considering α = 0.05, VRI is signiﬁcantly better than CI and PCI in terms
    of workload. The rest of

    the differences between the pairs of interfaces cannot be considered as signiﬁcant.

    Non-signiﬁcant (p = 0.3716)

    PCI > VRI

    PCI > PVRI

    Signiﬁcant (p = 0.0237)

    Non-signiﬁcant (p = 0.1008)

    To sum up, we can assert that workload is signiﬁcantly lower in virtual reality
    interfaces compared

    to conventional ones, both predictive and non-predictive. The effects of prediction
    on workload seem

    to be negative, but are nevertheless non signiﬁcant. These unexpected results
    were probably due to

    the operators’ need of training to interpret properly the predictive cues of the
    interfaces.

    7.2. Situational Awareness

    As fas as situational awareness is concerned, Table 6 shows that the interfaces
    can be arranged in

    the following order: PVRI, VRI, CI and PCI. This order points out the virtual
    reality interfaces tend

    to increase the situational awareness of operators, whereas the effects of the
    predictive components

    depend on the interface. However, the statistical signiﬁcance of these results
    must be checked.

    Figure 16 shows box and whisker diagrams for situational awareness of the four
    interfaces

    (CI, PCI, VRI and PVRI) and the two groups of interfaces (CIs and VRIs). The one-way
    ANOVA with

    α = 0.05 of the four interfaces does not provide signiﬁcant results (F = 1.49,
    p = 0.2296). However,

    the same analysis with the two groups of interfaces detects a signiﬁcant difference
    (F = 4.37, p = 0.042).

    Figure 16. Box and whisker diagrams for the situational awareness with four interfaces
    (left) and two

    groups of interfaces (right).

    Finally, the t-test of each pair of interfaces provides the results of Table 8.
    In this case, the differences

    between pairs of interfaces are not statistically relevant. However, the differences
    of VRI and PVRI over

    PCI are closer to α = 0.05 than the rest of them.

    PCI < VRI

    PCI < PVRI

    Non-signiﬁcant (p = 0.1011)

    Non-signiﬁcant (p = 0.0978)

    To sum up, we can state that virtual reality signiﬁcantly improves the situational
    awareness

    of operators, since their score in SAGAT questionnaire is signiﬁcantly higher
    than the score of

    conventional interfaces. In this case, the effects on prediction on situational
    awareness depend

    on the interface, probably due to the fact that prediction implementation with
    virtual reality is easier

    to understand than the implementation in a conventional interface. Nevertheless,
    these effects once

    again are not signiﬁcant.

    7.3. User Evaluation

    Finally, the questionnaires had a ﬁeld of observations where users could write
    comments and

    suggestions. A total of 39 reviews about the interfaces have been collected: 15
    were positive and 24

    were negative. The results can be seen in Table 6 and are described below.

    The conventional interface had 7 negative reviews, mainly related to the complexity
    of

    understanding the information of the mission (3) and the need to select the UAVs
    to get their

    full information (2).

    The predictive conventional interface also received 7 negative reviews, in this
    case about the

    amount of information (3) and the complexity to understand some variables (3).

    The virtual reality interface received 5 positive and 5 negative reviews. The
    positive comments

    pointed out that the interface is easy to understand (3) and fun to use (2), whereas
    the negative ones

    reported different problems about the observation platform (3), including perspective
    difﬁculties and

    physical discomfort.

    The predictive virtual reality interface received 10 positive and 5 negative reviews.
    In this case, the

    positive comments stated the interface is easy to understand (3) and comfortable
    (3), they also praised

    the usefulness of teleporting (1) and prediction (1). On the other hand, the negative
    ones reported

    difﬁculties to read some variables (3) and the mentioned problems with the observation
    platform (2).

    By way of curiosity, the situational awareness (SA) and workload (W) scores do
    not show

    correlation with the experience with videogames (V) and robot missions (RM). Speciﬁcally,
    these

    are the correlation coefﬁcients: V-SA (0.0102), RM-SA (−0.2048), V-W (0.0855)
    and RM-W (0.0675).

    8. Conclusions

    The scenarios with multiple robots and single operator suppose a challenge in
    terms of

    human factors. In these scenarios, the operator workload can be excessive, since
    they have to receive

    data, discover information, make decisions and send commands. Their situational
    awareness may also

    decline at certain moments of the mission, which can lead to errors in perception
    and decision-making

    that can cause accidents. This work analyzes the impact of immersive and predictive
    interfaces on

    these human factor problems.

    For this purpose, four interfaces have been developed: conventional (CI), predictive
    conventional

    (PCI), virtual reality (VRI) and predictive virtual reality (PVRI). These interfaces
    include multimodal

    interactions (VRI and PVRI), immersive technologies (VRI and PVRI) and predictive
    components

    (PCI and PVRI).

    Twenty-four operators have monitored eight multi-robot missions using the four
    interfaces and

    answered NASA-TLX and SAGAT questionnaires. The results of these tests showed
    that virtual

    reality interfaces signiﬁcantly improve the situational awareness and reduce the
    workload (speciﬁcally,

    Sensors 2017, 17, 1720

    22 of 25

    the components related to effort, performance and frustration). The effects of
    predictive components

    depend on the interface (negative in PC and positive in PVRI) and are not statistically
    signiﬁcant.

    Future works should continue this line and address diverse topics, such as the
    development and

    integration of multimodal commands, and the implementation of predictive components
    in virtual

    reality interfaces.

    for agriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world, which makes
    a case for the intensive use of technology to optimize the use of water, reduce
    the consumption of energy and improve the quality of crops. While the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and other associated technologies are the natural choice for smart
    water management applications, their appropriateness is still to be proven in
    real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots. Also, IoT-based application
    development platforms should be generic enough to be adapted to different crops,
    climates, and countries. The SWAMP project develops IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. In this paper, we present the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots
    and the scenario-based development process adopted in the project. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bilbao, Spain SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is vital for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture
    is by far the biggest consumer amounting to 70% of freshwater [7]. The leading
    causes of water wastage are leakages in distribution and irrigation systems, as
    well as, the field application methods, which result in wastage and the cultivation
    of crops. The most common irrigation technique, surface irrigation, is also the
    least precise one, which wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting areas
    where no plants can benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can
    use water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and
    over-irrigation. However, in an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by underirrigation,
    farmers feed more water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is
    challenged but also water is wasted. Therefore, technology should be developed
    and deployed for sensing the level of water needed by the plantation and for flowing
    the water in the proper amount to places where and when it is needed. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) [1] and other related technologies can be used for that purpose,
    but it faces several challenges. Firstly, Software Development for IoT-based smart
    applications is today not automatized and demands much effort. Secondly, advanced
    platforms are needed, that can automate part of the process and integrate different
    technologies and components for dealing with a multitude of requirements. Thirdly,
    the integration of heterogeneous and advanced sensors, particularly flying sensors
    (i.e., drones), may provide precision in the water supply for irrigation in agriculture.
    Fourthly, the use of a Software Platform together with different technologies
    such as IoT, big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing [3] and drones,
    for the deployment of pilot applications for smart water management. Fifthly,
    new business models for using IoT in smart water management settings are necessary.
    Moreover, finally, components must be interoperable, flexible and adaptable to
    be replicable to different locations, crops, and contexts. The primary objective
    of the SWAMP1 project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches for smart
    water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot the approaches in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil.
    Also, we aim at improving precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of
    the condition of the crop, by monitoring the field based on crop status (size,
    growing phase) and environment (e.g., weather forecast) and to adjust the irrigation
    prescription map accordingly. The smart water management pilots aim at guaranteeing
    that technological components are flexible enough to adapt to different contexts
    and to be replicable in different locations and settings. The same underlying
    SWAMP platform can be customized to different pilots considering different countries,
    climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP layered architecture considers three types
    of services to ensure its replication and adaptability to different crops and
    locations. Entirely replicable services deal with IoT services, virtual entities
    and storage services, and data analytics and machine learning, respectively. Fully
    customizable services deal with water data management issues that specialize generic
    analytic services into particular techniques for different types of irrigation
    and water distribution. Those services may require being customized whenever a
    new pilot is designed, developed and deployed. Finally, application specific services
    require higher development effort since they serve particular farms. The architecture
    may be implemented in a range of deployment configurations involving the use of
    smart algorithms and analytics in the cloud, fog-based smart decisions located
    on the farm premises and possibly mobile fog nodes acting in the field (e.g.,
    drones or in the central pivot irrigation mechanisms). In this paper, we present
    the SWAMP view of water management, the SWAMP architecture, the four SWAMP pilots
    and a scenario-oriented development process that consider both the crop needs
    and technological solutions. In the remainder of this paper, section II introduces
    concepts and related work. Section III introduces SWAMP concepts and methodology,
    while section IV presents the four pilots. Section V presents scenarios for deploying
    the pilots, and finally, section VI draws conclusions and future work. SECTION
    II. Iot In Precision Irrigation For Agriculture The Internet of Things is expected
    to have a decisive influence in the automation of smart water management applications.
    However, the development of IoT-enabled applications still takes tremendous efforts
    due to the lack of proper tools [8]. This scenario opens new opportunities and
    challenges in the specification, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of
    software development platforms for smart water management. The SWAMP project is
    being built upon existing efforts, generic platforms, architectures and research
    results [13]. The IoT-A project developed the IoT Reference Architecture for the
    generation of compliant IoT concrete architectures, focusing on using the current
    state of the art, rather than applying a clean slate approach [2]. FIWARE evolved
    from an EU-funded initiative for cloud services and now includes a platform with
    a set of Generic Enablers for developing smart applications [12], such as in the
    precision irrigation domain for agriculture [10]. When it comes to providing advanced
    features to the management of natural resources, such as water, there are some
    isolated initiatives not necessarily connected to the existing platforms and architectures.
    For example, the FIGARO project aims at increasing water productivity and improving
    irrigation practices through the development of a precision irrigation management
    platform, but not directly involving IoT [6]. Also, Popović et al. [11] present
    a case study of the specially designed and currently limited IoTenabled platform
    for collecting data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains.
    Agri-IoT [9] is a theoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and realtime
    processing for smart farming that shares some similarities with SWAMP. However,
    so far no real deployments have been reported, making it difficult to compare
    with SWAMP. In the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for
    IoT combined with cloud-based services and big data analytics. Now, the time has
    come to conduct experiments in real settings. In Europe, there is a current concern
    to understand the challenges and compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale pilots
    for smart agriculture. Brewster et al. discuss the deployment of those large-scale
    pilots for IoT in agriculture and describe technologies and solutions that might
    be present in some agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops and meat
    & vegetable supply chain [5]. Also, the European project IoF2020 aims at fostering
    the adoption of IoT in large-scale pilots in the farming and food domain2. Current
    existing solutions are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences.
    They are either too generic or too specific and do not explicitly address easy
    system development and deployment for facilitating replicability of scenarios
    and streamlining the deployment of new pilots. This is where SWAMP comes to play.
    SECTION III. Concept and Methodology The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision
    smart irrigation system concept for agriculture depicted in Fig. 1. The fundamental
    idea is to enable optimizations of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption
    based on a holistic analysis that collects information from all aspects of the
    system including even the natural water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related
    to growing particular plants. It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees
    the availability of water in situations where water supply is limited and also
    prevents over-and under-irrigation. Fig. 1. Precision irrigation based on smart
    water management Show All As depicted in Fig. 1 we identify three broad phases
    in a water management system for agriculture: W1: Water reserve: water reserves
    coming from different sources such as rivers, lakes, dams, and aquifers, which
    follow the natural water cycle. W2: Water distribution: water is transported from
    W1 to the final usage place (W3) through a network of canals, pipes, pumps, valves,
    and gates. Water distribution may assume different configurations depending on
    the region or country. In some places, water resources are carefully used and
    controlled by a central authority. W3: Water consumption: in agriculture, one
    of the critical uses of water is irrigation, which can be performed by different
    techniques. Irrigation (W3) is the principal objective of the SWAMP project. The
    SWAMP platform provides mechanisms for data acquisition from sensors, making decisions
    using a variety of different techniques and changing system behavior by sending
    commands to both automatic and human actuators. For Water Consumption (W3) SWAMP
    will provide real-time responses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions change.
    On the other hand, as changes in water distribution are performed in a different
    timescale, the management loop for W2 will be longer. W2 and W3 management systems
    are integrated, as water usage triggers water distribution. The SWAMP Architecture
    is divided into five layers, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. SWAMP Architecture
    Show All Layer 1: IoT Services: A variety of sensor and actuator technologies
    to acquire soil (e.g., moisture and temperature), plant (e.g., vegetation index,
    canopy temperature) and weather (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity,
    precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and direction) will be tested during
    the project. Layer 2: Virtual Entity and Data Storage: IoT Service descriptions
    are annotated with contextual metadata about the physical environment to create
    Virtual Entity (VE) representations of physical entities. Distributed databases
    composed of cloud and fog nodes work together for dealing with a massive amount
    of data coming from sensors and make them available to the upper layers. Layer
    3: Data Analytics: provides different components for context-aware management
    supported by cloud-based big data analytics techniques. SWAMP will utilize existing
    models and algorithms to realize the Layer 3, which may vary for different crops
    and pilots. Layer 4: Water Data Management: builds application related middleware
    management services on top of the generic data processing services provided by
    Layer 3. This layer decouples the irrigation-related business rules from applications
    providing an API for Layer 5 with a variety of algorithms, models, and mechanisms
    for facilitating and streamlining the development and deployment of new pilots.
    Layer 5: Water Application Services: A multitude of data that is sensed, acquired,
    stored, and processed is transformed into services that make sense to farmers.
    SWAMP initially will consider two types of water application services, water distribution
    services, and water usage services (i.e., irrigation). A fundamental idea in SWAMP
    is to facilitate the replication of water management systems built on top of its
    platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment. Different layers of the architecture
    have components that are more generic and thus less difficult to be ported to
    other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific and thus require new
    development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. When it comes to the generality/specificity
    scale, the SWAMP architecture provides three categories of components: a) Fully
    Replicable Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 of the architecture are generic enough
    to allow them to be replicable in different settings. Sensors, actuators and associated
    IoT Services vary according to the specific application domain; b) Fully Customizable
    Services: Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and
    therefore must be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques
    and models of water distribution and irrigation. Those services may require being
    customized for every new pilot; c) Application Specific Services: Services in
    Layer 5 address particularities of pilots. Given that parameters vary considerably
    for different countries, regulations, climate conditions, crops and soils, those
    services usually require more effort to be customized. SECTION IV. Swamp Pilots
    A. Pilot: Smart Water Distribution (Italy - CBEC) The Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia
    Centrale (CBEC) is a reclamation consortium of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern
    Italy, responsible for the irrigation and water drainage of an area of nearly
    3,130 km2 where most water required for irrigation is withdrawn from the Po river
    (Fig. 3). The water is distributed to the farms by an intricate irrigation infrastructure
    composed of more than 3580 km of canals, more than 200 small streams, six draining
    plants, and 72 pump stations with the capacity of 416 cubic meters per second.
    Fig. 3. Water distribution management pilot: open earth canal (left), manual operation
    (center) and water intake (right) Show All The supply and irrigation network consists
    of open channels on earth. Relevant widths characterize the main canals and their
    filling for the irrigation season involves the use of substantial water volumes
    that are not always recoverable for irrigation purposes. Water losses are due
    to evaporation and infiltration through canal banks and bottom, as well as to
    the management of the irrigation network that requires the filing of long canals
    stretches and several minor streams to accommodate farmer needs. The irrigation
    network also acts as drainage network for the cultivated areas. The SWAMP project
    aims at enhancing the overall system efficiency by acting at farmers and irrigation
    consortium levels. At the farmer level, SWAMP provides a better estimation of
    water needs regarding both amounts of water and time of delivery. This precise
    estimation can be achieved by the implementation of the IoT infrastructure that
    enables the integration of groundbased information with the weather forecast.
    At the consortium level, the management of the irrigation network can benefit
    from the optimization of multiple water requests ensured by the technological
    platform. The platform collects water needs adjusting the operational management
    of canals by merging detailed information of water needs, weather forecasts, and
    multiple requirements from farmers served by the same irrigation infrastructure.
    In particular, the SWAMP project enables the monitoring, automation, and remote
    control of the major hydraulic infrastructures, through which CBEC manages the
    water distribution within the irrigation district. The renovation of the hydraulic
    infrastructures together with the implementation of the IoT platform and data
    analytics scheme is expected to enable a consistent enhancement of the water distribution
    management that will persist after the project life. B. Pilot: Smart precision
    irrigation (Spain - Intercrop) This pilot is located in Cartagena, Spain, in the
    premises of Intercrop Iberica and addresses several challenges of smart irrigation
    and water management of geographically distributed fields, aiming at demonstrating
    the use of IoT sensor platforms and drones to achieve increased crop yield with
    optimal water usage with minimum labor effort. Even though Cartagena is located
    on the coast, that is a dry area with a short rain season with intense rains in
    just a few days. A considerable amount of water comes from a desalination plant,
    what contributes to make it a scarce and expensive good. Farms are distributed
    over areas of roughly 30 km radius in intensive cropping area. Pilot site is shown
    in Fig. 4. The immediate closeness of the control fields gives ideal circumstances
    to verify the effectiveness of the deployed methods. There are three growth periods
    during the project giving an opportunity to do iterative piloting and compare
    the results of different iterations. Fig. 4. Intercrop irrigation pilot site.
    In the right, the arrow shows the precise location of the pilot site Show All
    Growing period starts in early September and finishes by late April. Crops are
    from different ranges such as lettuce, endive, spinach, herbs, and bay leaf. These
    farms are irrigated separately through their proper reservoirs and irrigation
    systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods, we selected the pilot
    site from the same area with control field that is using traditional irrigation
    and monitoring methods. Irrigation system on the pilot field is managed using
    solenoid valves, and total water consumption can be monitored via water meters.
    Facilities used in piloting are a local weather station, online weather services,
    long life smart soil sensors, drone gateway, and real-time cloud data analysis.
    C. Pilot: Variable Rate Irrigation (Brazil) The MATOPIBA region encompasses the
    Brazilian states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), Piauí (PI) and Bahia (BA),
    and is one of the most critical irrigated agricultural frontier in the country,
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Irrigation is mostly performed
    by thousands of center pivots, each one with an average size of 100 ha. The municipality
    of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (Fig. 5), the location for the center pivot pilot, is
    considered the capital of Brazilian agribusiness. Fig. 5. Center-pivot irrigation
    pilot: location of the pilot site (left) and center pivot irrigation for soybean
    crop (right) Show All The soybean production reached about 5.5 million tons in
    2016. Despite such production, the farmers estimated 40% crop losses due to the
    2015/16 season drought. The production from many properties was only 30 sacks
    per hectare, while an average of 58 sacks was expected. With irrigation and investments
    in soil fertility, some producers expect that this number can reach 80 sacks.
    Although irrigation is an alternative, its expansion depends on technologies that
    improve operating costs. For example, in 2015/16 the government imposed double
    charges to the energy used in irrigation, which costs seven sacks per hectare
    against three and a half sacks with a typical energy charging. The main MATOPIBA
    pilot goal is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable
    Rate Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production. However, alternate
    crops like corn and cotton are also usual, including during the same season. Conventional
    center pivot irrigation systems help to provide a reliable supply of water, increase
    yields, and provide double cropping potential. The proposed smart irrigation will
    help the crop in the same way while making rational use of water and energy. D.
    Pilot: Precision Drop Irrigation (Brazil - Guaspari) One of the significant innovations
    of winemaking in State of São Paulo, Brazil, is occurring in the municipality
    of Espírito Santo do Pinhal in the Guaspari Winery. It is the transfer of wine
    grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August), when the thermal amplitude,
    insolation, and absence of rainfall are better for harvesting, similar to the
    great wine regions of the world. The different terroirs that compose the vineyard
    are divided into plots, which are harvested separately. In that growing area,
    altitude ranges between 1,000 m and 1,300 m; nights are cold and optimal sunshine
    during the day provides an air temperature range between 10°C and 12°C at harvesting
    time, similar to that of large European regions. The soil is developed from granite
    rock, with good drainage, which is suitable for grapes destined to produce high-quality
    wines. The application of water by an irrigation system depends on the crop, weather,
    and soil conditions. Even with the availability of several criteria and procedures
    for the performance of irrigation management, the technique has a low adoption
    rate by the farmers. Occasionally irrigation is based on only the experience of
    the grower, on the visualization of the wet soil surface or even on the perception
    of visual symptoms of plant water deficit, which, when identified late, can affect
    yield and product quality. The lack of knowledge about irrigation management procedures
    can lead to the failure of this water application practice, even if there is a
    system designed for a specific cropping area. Guaspari Winery uses drip irrigation
    in its vineyards, with a single hose and emitters spaced at 0.5 m, and measured
    the flow of 1.9 L h-1. The experimental area has 1.1 ha and is shown in Fig. 6.
    The objectives of the Guaspari Winery Pilot are: a) to perform automatic measuring
    of soil water content at different soil depths and in several vineyards inside
    the winery s growing area; b) to store data in the cloud about soil water content
    be jointly processed with weather and crop information; c) To provide quick and
    accurate irrigation management information. Fig. 6. Guaspari Winery: Vineyard
    and pilot location (right) Show All SECTION V. Swamp Scenarios The SWAMP Platform
    is being built on existing and new concepts and technologies, implementing the
    SWAMP vision (Fig. 1) through the SWAMP Architecture (Fig. 2), which may be flexible
    enough to deal with the needs of four different IoT pilots for smart water management
    in precision irrigation located in three countries. For making this vision to
    come true, a scenario-based architecture design and requirement gathering are
    being conducted to match the needs of crops and farmers’ expertise with existing
    technological solutions. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario representing the center-pivot
    with variable-rate irrigation pilot to be deployed in the MATOPIBA region in Brazil.
    The scenario captures both the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents
    a future vision and not the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular
    agricultural plot of 100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot
    is further divided into different management zones, identified before the crop
    season and based on differences in the soil properties. Even though the crop is
    the same throughout the plot, each management zone receives a different irrigation
    prescription, to make available the same amount of water for plants regardless
    the way water is percolated and infiltrated in different soil types. Two general
    types of sensors collect data for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within
    the soil at the root system depth that continually measure metrics such as temperature
    and moisture, and; b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral
    cameras or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to
    the farm’s office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control
    the variable rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped
    with processing and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is
    predicted for the sensing devices. We will develop multiparametric probes for
    soil sensing, which include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity
    sensors at three depths from the soil surface. In intensive agriculture areas
    the plan is also to experiment ultra low power wireless sensor solutions based
    on wake up radios combined with LoRaWAN [3]. Sensors will stay on standby and
    wake up for a few milliseconds. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted
    from a few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    low power LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. We consider
    using both ZigBee and LoRaWAN, for short and long distances, respectively. Other
    sensing devices deployed in low quantity or devices requiring heavier duty cycles,
    like a water source level sensor and weather station, will be solar powered. Both
    the center pivot and drones are considered Field Fog Nodes (FFN) in the SWAMP
    Architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor aggregation
    point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the SWAMP system.
    FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the SWAMP Platform,
    which usually is an onpremises Fog Hub Node (or just fog hub) located in the farm’s
    office. Please notice that this choice aims at providing autonomous processing
    capacity to the farm at our pilot since it is in a region where Internet connections
    may suffer periods of instability. SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with
    the Platform running in the cloud, whenever this is the preferred deployment choice.
    The FFNs send data directly to the SWAMP Platform located in the CFN at the farm’s
    offices via different wireless technologies. In Fig. 7 it is represented by a
    Base Station, such as a WiFi access point, a LoRaWAN gateway, a ZigBee router
    or a Cell Base Station. For this scenario, the functions performed by the SWAMP
    Architecture are divided up into local Fog and remote Cloud components. Heavy
    processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart algorithms (i.e.,
    machine learning), is performed in the cloud. In our pilot, we will first experiment
    with existing irrigation models for precision agriculture where analytics plays
    the role of automatic parameter tuning. After enough data is obtained, analytical
    models will be tested for generating the irrigation prescription maps. External
    information is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological
    data and historical data. Fig. 7. Scenario representing the center-pivot irrigation
    pilot Show All Fig. 8 depicts the CBEC SWAMP pilot, focused on water distribution
    management. Water is conveyed from the Po River in Italy through a network of
    open canals automated by a set of pumps, valves, gauges and gates operated by
    CBEC. The SWAMP platform estimates the water needs of individual farms by analyzing
    sensor data and other relevant information, generates the irrigation prescription
    maps and sends them to the farmers, who perform the irrigation using the method
    they see fit. The water need estimate for each farm is in turn fed into a component
    devoted to optimizing the management of water distribution, by sending commands
    to actuators installed in devices that control the water flow through the canals,
    up to the point farmers can use them. The purpose is to make more efficient use
    of the water deviated from the river. Fig. 8 does not explicitly show how the
    data is sent from sensors to the SWAMP platform because different technologies
    are used by farmers to transmit the data through the Internet. The SWAMP Platform
    is represented as a single component, whereas in practice a distributed cloud/fog
    architecture can be used, such as the one shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    IoT is the natural choice for smart water management applications, but its appropriateness
    is still to be proven in real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots.
    In this paper, we presented the SWAMP project, which develops IoT based methods
    for smart water management in precision irrigation, and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. We introduced the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots and the
    scenario-based development process adopted in the project. SWAMP is still in its
    beginning but has already attracted the attention of farmers, agribusiness companies,
    and government agencies around the world. In its current stage, we visited and
    surveyed the pilots and explored the implications on the platform of different
    pilot sites, crops and requirements. The key insights so far refer to the commonalities
    and variability of features of pilots that can positively contribute to the design
    of a genuinely replicable SWAMP platform. Fig. 8. Scenario representing the water

    The article proposes a methodology for optimizing the process of irrigation of
    crops using a phytoindication system based on computer vision methods. We have
    proposed an algorithm and developed a system for obtaining a map of irrigation
    for maize in low latency mode. The system can be installed on a center pivot irrigation
    and consists of 8 IP cameras connected to a DVR connected to a laptop. The algorithm
    consists of three stages. Image preprocessing stage - applying an integrated excess
    green and excess red difference (ExGR) index. The classification stage is the
    application of the method that we choose depending on the system’s operating conditions.
    At the final stage, a neural network trained using the Resilient Propagation method
    is used, which determines the rate of watering of plants in the current sector
    of the location of the sprinkler. The selected methods of pretreatment and classification
    made it possible to achieve an accuracy of plant identification up to 93%, growth
    stages - up to 92% (with unconsolidated maize sowing and good lighting). System
    performance up to 100 plants in one second, which exceeds the performance of similar
    systems. The neural network showed an accuracy of 92% on the training set and
    87% on the test set. Dynamic analysis of spatial and temporal variability leads
    to an increase in productivity and efficiency of water use. In addition, given
    the ubiquitous distribution of agribusiness management systems, this approach
    is quite simple to implement in the farm’s conditions. Artificial neural networks

    I. Introduction According to statistics, agricultural production on a global scale
    over the past half-century has grown 2.5-3 times, and the growth of acreage was
    about 12%. In addition, according to UNESCO data, agriculture is undoubtedly the
    largest consumer of water, while 70% of the total freshwater intake is used for
    irrigation [1]. In water-stressed regions, irrigation is of fundamental importance,
    as irrigated agriculture accounts for 16% of the world’s cultivated area, which
    produces 30% to 40% of the world’s food [2]. At the same time, the area of irrigated
    land has more than doubled over fifty years and comprises on average more than
    16% of all agricultural land, and the volume of water withdrawn for irrigation
    has almost doubled. FAO’s projected 1-2% annual growth in global irrigated areas,
    as well as trends in climate change (temperature and precipitation), in the next
    20 years could lead to a significant increase in water consumption (according
    to FAO estimates by 14%) and energy, which in turn puts forward the problem of
    saving water, energy and material and technical resources, protecting the natural
    environment [2]. Traditional methods of planning irrigation based on visual inspection
    lead to significant water losses and raise the issue of optimizing irrigation.
    All of this has contributed to the emergence of various methods of controlled
    irrigation such as sprinkler, drip, and furrow irrigation. The introduction of
    these methods allows to reduce water losses by 30–70% and contributes to the sustainable
    development of irrigated agriculture [3]. Further development of optimization
    methods led to the emergence of the so-called precision irrigation, which allows
    you to estimate the amount of water, irrigation time, and maintains the exact
    water content in the soil, depending on the needs of the growth and development
    of crops. In this regard, technologies of precision farming have become widespread,
    which involve considering spatial and temporal variability and differentiating
    the use of resources [4], [5]. In this regard, a key problem of irrigation management
    arises - its optimization both from the point of view of irrigation technique
    and from the point of view of technology. Classical water resources management
    is based on the use of uniformly introduced resources across the field, considered
    as a single spatial unit and if the actual operating parameters of the sprinkler
    equipment coincide with the theoretical ones. However, on the one hand, sprinkler
    technology is a complex dynamic system, the operation of which is influenced by
    many stochastic factors. On the other hand, the object of the impact of technology
    - the field is a complex biological system with Spatio-temporal heterogeneity
    of the characteristics of soil, climate, plants, and, therefore, uneven need for
    irrigation [6], [7]. The operation of irrigation equipment plays an important
    role in irrigated agriculture. Optimizing irrigation equipment is an important
    strategy for conserving resources, increasing productivity, and improving production
    efficiency. Among the various systems, one can distinguish Center Pivot Irrigation
    Systems, which account for up to 23% of the total area irrigated by sprinkler
    irrigation systems [8]. And in Russia, for example, about 22% of the total irrigated
    area is irrigated with such systems. A. Precision Agriculture, Digitalization,
    and Artificial Intelligence In connection with the role played by Center Pivot
    Irrigation systems (CPI), numerous studies are being carried out to improve the
    technical parameters of these systems: improving the uniformity of irrigation,
    modeling sprinklers, and lateral corner joints [9]–[11]. In addition, the Precision
    Agriculture methodology appears for such systems as well. Variable Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) considers Spatio-temporal variability by delivering a variable amount of
    water to a specific area following crop water requirements. At the same time,
    for sprinkler systems of circular action, VRI assumes either irrigation at a controlled
    speed (assumes a change in the irrigation rate in the direction of a moving sprinkler
    by changing the speed of its movement) or irrigation with a controlled zone (involves
    a change in the irrigation rate both along the side pipeline and in the direction
    of movement sprinkler) [12]. Many scientists have been involved in the development
    and improvement of VRI methods [12]–[14] since the creation of optimal VRI solutions
    is rather difficult and must consider a large number of factors. Some scientists
    considered the properties of water in the soil as a basis for monitoring, others
    - the state of plants. Thus, in the study [12], automatic control of the speed
    of movement is based on technologies for monitoring the electrical conductivity
    of the soil and altimetry, the moisture content in the soil, and vegetation indices
    obtained from satellite images. In [13], the interaction between spatially changing
    soil properties and the time-varying dynamics of water in crops is investigated.
    It is shown that modeling soil moisture depletion can be an effective planning
    tool in VRI. A decision support system for variable rate irrigation is presented
    in a study [14]. The system is based on the vegetation index (VI), obtained after
    processing multispectral images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles. And the
    evapotranspiration model and the crop water stress index are derived from their
    established relationships with the vegetation index. Work [15] summarizes the
    advantages and disadvantages of the variable rate irrigation methodology. Until
    now, these methods need further development and improvement as further studies
    of space-time variability are needed to make these improvements. Digitalization
    is becoming one of such powerful tools for increasing the efficiency of both irrigation
    and agriculture in general. The current stage of development of precision farming
    and digital agriculture makes it possible to widely use such tools based on artificial
    intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is the basis for intelligent agriculture.
    Thus, [16] provides an overview of best practices in the implementation of sensor
    irrigation systems, along with the most used nodes and wireless technologies.
    In such systems, wireless sensor networks and all kinds of sensors (soil moisture,
    soil temperature, ambient temperature, etc.) are actively used. Optimization of
    irrigation is achieved in various ways, in [17] - by precise control of the water
    valve using neural network forecasting of soil water demand, and in [18], for
    example, by integrating an automated irrigation system with an irrigation decision
    support tool. In addition, all sorts of applications are created for data analysis
    and decision support at all stages of the agricultural cycle. SWAMP platform [19]
    for intelligent water management based on the Internet of Things for precision
    irrigation. The system for optimal irrigation of crops [20] is based on a wireless
    sensor network using nodal sensors in the field and data management via a smartphone
    and a web application. [21] presents a study on the integration between various
    tools to improve water efficiency in agriculture (field sensors and remote sensing).
    The systems considered in [22], [23] involve data monitoring, their preliminary
    processing, integration, synchronization, and storage with subsequent use for
    intelligent irrigation. Thus, the digitalization of agriculture makes it possible
    to make the transition from classical control systems to systems with artificial
    intelligence. In recent years, many researchers in the development of the Precision
    Agriculture methodology in general and for irrigation management use such a tool
    as artificial neural networks. The range of applications of artificial neural
    networks in agriculture is very wide. Researchers are using these tools to model
    agricultural production, replacing classical mathematical models. They can be
    both part of precision farming systems and decision support. An overview of the
    application is presented in [24], [25] and includes forecasting in agriculture,
    intelligent monitoring of diseases and pests, and weed control. Artificial intelligence
    methods are also used to optimize storage and transportation processes. In addition,
    AI methods contribute to the improvement of the automation of various processes.
    The introduction of artificial intelligence in agriculture is associated with
    the problems of the systematic collection of data from multiple sources of storage
    and analysis. Approaches to solving these problems are outlined in [26], [27]
    and represent pilot projects for the analysis of advanced control systems in various
    natural and climatic conditions. One of the key artificial intelligence techniques,
    such as machine learning, has significant potential for solving numerous problems.
    The work [28] provides an overview of the use of machine learning in agriculture,
    namely, the management of water resources, soil, and animal husbandry. Big data
    and machine learning (ML) open new possibilities for understanding agricultural
    processes using data, along with this, there are numerous problems of integrating
    these technologies that require research and solution [29]. Machine learning is
    an important decision support tool, for example in [30] it has found application
    in yield forecasting, including making decisions about crop types and cultivation
    technologies during the growing season. Artificial intelligence methods are gaining
    importance in agricultural robotics. A study of the similarities and differences
    between industrial and field robots is presented in [31], along with a suggestion
    of potential methods for use on farms. B. Artificial Intelligence in Irrigated
    Agriculture In recent years, data-driven models have begun to play a key role
    in comparison with classical physical models. Methods of artificial intelligence,
    machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks show good predictive characteristics,
    more quickly and efficiently process large arrays of Spatio-temporal data. This
    is especially important for irrigation management due to the large Spatio-temporal
    variability of external conditions and, often, the need for continuous calibration
    in real-time. These methods have numerous applications for irrigation and water
    management. Some systems [32] are based on an intelligent algorithm that considers
    the received sensor data together with the parameters of the weather forecast
    (precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV radiation) for the near future.
    In others [17], [33], irrigation is optimized by precise control of the water
    valve, current sensors using neural networks forecasting soil water demand, or
    fuzzy inferences [34] by creating prescriptive maps to control the rotation speed
    of the central axis based on remote sensing. The combination of big data and machine
    learning technologies with remote sensing technologies leads to the creation of
    new methods and algorithms presented in [35]. And [36] presents the development
    of a combined intelligent agricultural machine that can automatically weed and
    irrigate at a variable rate on a cultivated field. Some approaches to the intellectualization
    of CPI control systems are considered in [37]. One of the directions is the creation
    of intelligent decision support systems. In [38], a comparative study of various
    algorithms and training methods (ANN, linear regression (LR), random forest regression
    (RFR) and auxiliary vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and adaptive
    gain (AdaBoost) algorithms were carried out to determine the admissibility of
    the erroneousness of the experts’ decisions. Such systems are also developed at
    the level of management of irrigation systems. The AWARD system [39] uses artificial
    neural network techniques to predict water level, a fuzzy logic control algorithm
    to estimate the sluice adjustment period, and hydraulic equations to adjust the
    sluice level. An example is DLiSA’s intelligent irrigation system based on a deep
    learning neural network for predicting the volumetric moisture content in the
    soil, the period of irrigation, and the spatial distribution of water, considering
    the need for it [40]. In addition, models of artificial neural networks and machine
    learning are used to calculate important irrigation parameters, such as soil moisture
    [41], soil salinity [42], horizontal daily global solar irradiation predictive
    modeling [43], modeling the water-soil regime and transport of dissolved substances
    [44]. And, artificial neural networks, machine learning to use to develop strategies
    for irrigation management with given economic parameters to reduce water and energy
    consumption without compromising crop yields [45]–[47]. Yang et al. [48] proposed
    an integrated CNN model based on hyperspectral and RGB images taken at 5 stages
    of corn growth. Pang et al. [49] based on drone images using the combined convolutional
    neural network MaxArea Mask Scoring RCNN, areas of poor germination of corn were
    identified. The authors noted the high processing speed, however, does not allow
    the use of this system for real-time applications. Zhong et al. [50] recorded
    different stages of plant growth using a method based on a combination of time
    series with convolutional neural networks. Kuznetsova et al. [51], [52] use high-speed
    computer vision techniques YOLOv3 and YOLOv5 on a robotic crop picker. Despite
    a large amount of research, there are still many open problems in the field of
    optimal irrigation management using CPI systems. The variable rate irrigation
    approach has undoubtedly proven to be effective. However, an analysis of the current
    state of research on VRI optimization by CPI systems allows us to identify the
    main problem points: The complexity of collecting the required data set, the lack
    of time series data on the state of a particular field, and crop yields in this
    field, considering the temporal climatic variability. Difficulty in choosing appropriate
    data analysis methods to find a compromise between the two paradigms for monitoring
    spatial variability - water properties in soil and plant health. Difficulty in
    applying more accurate methods of intellectual analysis in dynamics during the
    entire agricultural season. Difficulty in the technical implementation of the
    proposed solutions, for example, expensive sensors, sensors, and other equipment.
    With current advances in proximal and non-invasive sensing technologies, IOTs
    can provide a wealth of information about soil, crops, and related environmental
    properties, and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze all this data are
    contributing to new approaches to improve the situation. The use of computer vision
    systems for condition monitoring seems to be quite interesting due to the relatively
    inexpensive implementation and the possibility of using more accurate methods
    of intellectual analysis. Optimal variable rate irrigation management requires
    a combination of both computer vision systems and additional climate and remote
    sensing data to detect Spatio-temporal dynamic variability in crop water requirements.
    The purpose of this study is to develop a methodology for optimizing irrigation
    by creating dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions. It is based on the implementation
    of regular monitoring of the state of crops and the environment through phytoindication,
    as well as forecasting the dynamic variability of the state of water availability
    to improve irrigation. The proposed solutions offer a combination of neural network
    approaches, from the use of multilayer artificial neural networks to pattern recognition
    and convolution neural networks. The algorithm of the proposed approach is as
    follows: At the first step, the Phyto monitoring of the state of the agricultural
    crop and the environment is carried out based on computer vision using convolution
    neural networks. At the second step, a dynamic variable forecast is constructed
    based on the time series of data of average daily air temperature (T), amount
    of precipitation (R), Air humidity (AH), Wind speed (WS), and Normalized Difference
    Water Index (NDWI) -ability of water availability based on multilayer artificial
    neural networks. As a result, we obtain dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions
    based on the classification procedure of the results of the first two neural networks.
    SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Materials The study was conducted in the
    Saratov region of the Russian Federation. Russia has significant soil and water
    resources, but the largest part of its land used for agricultural production is
    in areas of risky agriculture with insufficient or excessive modes of natural
    moisture. Only 2% of the land in the Russian Federation is in optimal moisture
    conditions. The main share of agricultural products (in value terms) is produced
    in the arid zone, where more than 78% of arable land is concentrated. The land
    reclamation fund of the Russian Federation amounted to an area of 9.45 million
    hectares of which 75% was used, including 4.67 million hectares of irrigated land,
    of which 82% was used and 4.78 million hectares of drained land, of which 68%
    were used [46]. The Volga region is one of the largest regions of Russia, where
    land reclamation is developed. The Saratov Region occupies about 10% of the total
    area of the Volga Federal District. The Volga Federal District is in third place
    among the federal districts in terms of reclaimed lands and the leader in terms
    of the percentage of irrigated lands in good condition. Among all regions, the
    Saratov region ranks first in the district in terms of the area of reclaimed land
    - 19%. The main climatic parameters of the irrigated zone of the Saratov region
    are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 The Main Climatic Parameters of the Study Area
    The sums of air humidity deficits in the warm season increase from north to south
    from 1800 to 2200 millibars. On the contrary, the sums of active temperatures
    decrease in the same direction from 3500 to 3000 °C. The zonal soils of the left-bank
    regions (the main irrigation zone) of the Saratov region are classified as southern
    chernozems, chestnut of various subtypes (dark-chestnut, light-chestnut, and chestnut
    proper), as well as brown semi-desert in the extreme southeast of the left bank.
    In terms of the content of organic matter, the soils of the Left Bank are rather
    poor: it varies within 3.0 … 5.0% in southern chernozems, 2.5 … 4.0% in dark chestnut
    soils; 1.5 … 3.0% for light chestnut and chestnut. In the natural and climatic
    zone of the Saratov region, there is significant spatial variability of natural
    conditions, primarily soil, geomorphological, hydrogeological. Analysis of the
    data of the geoinformation system for monitoring irrigated lands showed that within
    the framework of the site of one farm, they can be located on 133 contours of
    29 soil differences. Moreover, individual irrigated fields were located on several
    soil differences - from 2 to 5. The quantitative and qualitative composition of
    irrigation techniques plays an important role both in the condition of irrigated
    lands and in increasing the efficiency of agricultural production on irrigated
    lands. In Russia about 22% of CPI systems are used; in the melioration complex
    of the Saratov region, these systems are the main ones. To collect data, experimental
    studies were carried out in the Engelsky district of the Saratov region of Russia
    (experimental farm ≪ Povolgy ≫ of the Saratov State Agrarian University). The
    irrigated area is equipped with the Center Pivot Irrigation (CPI) system ≪ Cascade
    ≫ . It is equipped with GPS trackers, cameras and real-time data is displayed
    in the ≪ Agrosignal ≫ digital platform for agribusiness management (Figure 1).
    In addition, the ≪ Agrosignal ≫ system allows collecting data on weather, soil
    condition, and basic agrotechnical information about crops, equipment operation
    based on weather station sensors, remote sensing, etc. In this study, the following
    data were used: Climatic data - wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative
    air humidity, temperature and humidity of foliage and soil, atmospheric pressure,
    amount of precipitation. Indices - Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). CPI
    information - speed. FIGURE 1. The ≪ Agrosignal ≫ system window. Show All An example
    of a date-set of climatic data for a month (June 2020) is given in Table 2. The
    Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) provides information on both the spatial
    distribution of water stress on vegetation and its temporal development. The example
    of an image of the NDWI index for the experimental site is shown in Figure 2.
    TABLE 2 Data-set: Climatic Data FIGURE 2. NDWI index snapshot. Show All The second
    component of our system is based on biological methods for diagnosing anthropogenic
    changes - this is both the state of the agricultural crop itself and the state
    of the environment. The active use of these methods is associated with the quick
    reaction of organisms to any deviations in the environment from the norm. In our
    study, these are the parameters of the soil condition in the irrigated area. Control
    is necessary for almost all-important parameters of the state of the soil. These
    include the provision of soil with moisture, mechanical composition, type of oxidation-reduction
    regime, etc. We use an approach based on determining the qualitative properties
    of the soil using indicator plants. It is based [53] considering the species diversity
    of macrophytes and their indicator significance. Phytoindicators are called plants,
    plant communities, or their features that indicate some specific properties of
    the environment. Phytoindication is one of the practical uses of various traits
    and properties of individual plants or plant communities and their complexes to
    obtain qualitative and sometimes quantitative characteristics of the environment.
    With the help of plants, it is possible to identify individual characteristics
    of soils: their texture, moisture, acidity, salinity, nutrient supply. Figure
    3 shows plant bioindicators used in our study. FIGURE 3. Plants—bioindicators
    and the main crop: 1) Cirsium arvense, 2) chamomile, 3) wormwood, 4) main crop—corn.
    Show All B. Calculation of the Vegetation Index For better localization of plants
    in the image, we use the vegetation index. This increases the contrast between
    vegetation and soil. Three bands of the spectrum are used as color sources: red
    (R), green (G), and blue (B). Since the encoding of each band is carried out in
    the range from 0 to 255, we normalize the image using (1): r= b= R R+G+B ;g= G
    R+G+B ; B R+G+B ;r+g+b=1 (1) View Source Considering the peculiarities of the
    object of study of video filming, we are interested in the index of excess green

    The HOG method assumes that the type of distribution of image intensity gradients
    makes it possible to accurately determine the presence and shape of objects present
    on it. The image is split into cells. Histograms hi of the directed gradients
    of the interior points are calculated in the cells. They are combined into one
    bar chart h = f ( h 1 ,…, h k ), after which it is normalized in brightness. The
    normalization factor can be obtained in several ways, but they show approximately
    the same results. We will use the following: h L = h ∥h∥ 2 2 + ε 2 − − − − − −
    − − √ (5) View Source where ∥h∥ 2 – used norm, ε – some small constant. When calculating
    the gradients, the image is convolved with the kernels [−1, 0, 1] and [−1, 0,
    1]T, as a result of which two matrices Dx and Dy of derivatives along the x and
    y axes are formed, respectively. These matrices are used to calculate the angles
    and magnitudes of the gradients at each point in the image. Figure 5 (2, 4, 6)
    shows the result of applying the HOG method to an image processed using vegetation
    index 5 (1, 3, 5). For clarity, only the magnitude of the gradient is shown (the
    brighter the pixel, the larger the gradient). FIGURE 5. Images of corn plants

    ExGR index and 2), 4), and 6) obtained by the HOG method. Show All The scale-invariant
    feature transform (SIFT) descriptor is used to extract feature points from the
    image, which are later used in classifiers. The key point in finding them is building
    a pyramid of Gaussians and the difference of Gaussians. Gaussian - image blurred
    with a Gaussian filter: L(x,y,σ)=G(x,y,σ)∗I(x,y), (6) View Source with coordinates
    (x,y) and blur radius σ ; G(x,y,σ) – Gaussian kernel; I(x,y) – the value of the
    original image; ∗ - convolution operation. The difference of Gaussians is an image
    obtained by pixel-by-pixel subtraction of the Gaussian of the original image from
    a Gaussian with a different blur radius ( kσ ): D(x,y,σ)=L(x,y,kσ)−L(x,y,σ) (7)
    View Source A pyramid of Gaussians and Gaussian differences is constructed. When
    moving from one level of the pyramid to another, the dimensions of the images
    are halved. After building the pyramids, the singular points are determined, which
    are the local extrema of the difference of the Gaussians. False key points are
    discarded, and for the remaining ones, their orientation is calculated. The magnitude
    of the gradient m and the direction of the gradient θ is determined from the (8)-(9):
    m(x,y)= θ(x,y)= ( (L(x+1,y)−L(x−1,y)) 2 + (L(x,y+1)−L(x,y−1)) 2 ) 1/2 tan −1 (
    L(x,y+1)−L(x,y−1) L(x+1,y)−L(x−1,y) ) (8) (9) View Source In the SIFT method,
    the descriptor is a vector. Take a 4×4 square area centered at the singular point,
    rotate following the direction of the singular point. Each element of the area
    indicates the magnitude of the gradient in eight directions. D. Image Classification
    Using BOVW BOVW is used to improve the performance of descriptors. This approach
    considers the blocks as key parts of the plant, and each block’s HOG represents
    the local information of the corresponding part. Next, we cluster the HOG of all
    the blocks in the training set into homogeneous groups using K-means, and the
    centers will be the mean value of the blocks’ HOG within the cluster. (We then
    group the HOGs of all the blocks in the training set into homogeneous groups using
    K-means, and the centers will be the average of the HOGs of the blocks in the
    cluster.) These centers will play the role of Visual-Words in BOVW (Figure 6).
    FIGURE 6. Steps to create a Visual-Words. Show All SECTION III. Experiments and
    Results A. Installation 8 IP cameras were installed on the irrigation system,
    connected to an 8-channel video recorder, constantly filming plants. For more
    efficient video recording, the cameras were not evenly fixed to the irrigation
    system. The first camera was installed at a remote point of the irrigation system.
    The removal of the rest was determined by (10): r i =K∗ (2i−1)/2 − − − − − − −
    − √ (10) View Source where i is the ordinal number of the chamber, starting from
    the axis of rotation of the irrigation system, ri is the distance to it. The K
    coefficient is obtained by substituting the number of chambers involved and the
    distance from the axis of rotation to the most distant point of the irrigation
    system into this formula. In our case, with a radius of the irrigation system
    equal to 370 meters, the coefficient is 95.5 meters. We used camcorders with a
    fixed focal length of 3.6 mm, matrix size 1/2.8, which allowed us to take pictures
    with a viewing angle of up to 96 degrees. The protection class of the camera is
    ip67. The protection class was fundamentally important because the cells were
    constantly exposed to streams of water. The large viewing angle of the video camera
    allows you to track the same plant from different angles while moving it. This
    allows you to collect much more information on each object under study, and therefore
    more accurately determine its state and phase of development. We abandoned cameras
    with a viewing angle greater than 100 degrees because we must perform additional
    preprocessing methods to correct aberrations that significantly distort the image.
    In addition, the greater the angle at which the plant is located to the vertical,
    the more overlap of parts of nearby growing plants on it, and this leads to serious
    errors in classification. Considering the height of the cameras above the ground
    (in our case, 1 meter, we came to the optimal sliding window with a size of 1
    * 1 m. Now about the shooting speed. The IP cameras used operate at a frequency
    of 30 Fpx. There is no point in processing all these frames. This would make our
    computer vision system extremely slow. The number of processed frames per second
    depends on the speed of movement of the irrigation unit and is determined from
    the following considerations: each plant that falls into the sliding window must
    be processed at least 2 times. For a linear speed of 0.5 m / s, the point farthest
    from the bore axis, from the outermost video camera, 1 image should be processed
    in 1 second. If you take images from all 8 cameras (the closer the camera is to
    the axis of rotation, the fewer shots you need to take per second), you need to
    process no more than 5 shots per second. If the number of weeds is not significant
    and the rotation speed of the extreme point does not exceed 1 m/s, the computer
    vision system works in real-time. When setting up the video system, special attention
    had to be paid to protecting the camera lenses from water droplets and fogging.
    If we use a cone-shaped casing from direct moisture penetration. B. Image Processing
    Techniques Initially, the vegetation index was calculated from the photograph,
    which was used to obtain a grayscale and binary image. For further image processing,
    we tested three high-performance methods: SIFT-SVM, HOG-BOVW-BPNN, and binarization
    by the ExGR - CNN index. For comparison, the outdated HOG-CNN method was tested
    along with them. The first two methods were applied to grayscale images, and the
    third to a binary image. All algorithms used in the work are implemented using
    the OpenCV Python library. The classification was made according to the following
    criteria: corn Figure 4, weed from the list of indicators Figure 3, weed. When
    corn is identified, the stage of growth is determined. To train the methods, a
    dataset was used, of 1500 corn plants at different stages of development. The
    dataset was marked by agricultural scientists working on the farm. In addition,
    a dataset with indicator plants was used (from 500 to 800 for each variety). The
    results of the methods are shown in Tables 3 and 4. TABLE 3 Results of the Work
    of Methods for the Determination of Indicator Plants and Corn Plants TABLE 4 The
    Results of Methods for Determining the Stage of Growth of Corn It can be seen
    from the results obtained that the classical HOG - CNN method is significantly
    inferior to any of the three selected. SIFT-SVM is not inferior to the other two
    in terms of processing speed, but the results of its work are slightly worse than
    the other two. We were unable to choose the best among the two remaining methods.
    Even though in the CNN method we used 3 x 3 convolutional kernels (this greatly
    accelerated it), the HOG-BOVW-BPNN method is 20% faster, but its classification
    results are slightly lower in sunny conditions. In cloudy weather, the results
    are reduced for both methods, but the HOG-BOVW-BPNN method is more stable in reducing
    the illumination level [54]. We assume that it makes sense to use both methods
    depending on the conditions. The results of these methods (tables 3 and 4) significantly
    exceed the results presented in works on computer vision in recent years [48]–[50].
    This is merit not only of modern methods of computer vision but also of successful
    shooting conditions. The sprinkler removes dust from plant leaves and the ExGR
    imaging method works most efficiently. C. Dynamic Maps of Irrigation Prescriptions
    A schematic representation of the key algorithm is shown in Table 5: TABLE 5 Algorithm
    In the previous works of the authors, a program [55] was developed for determining
    the optimal parameters of humidification in the calculated soil layer for the
    main crops, including corn, for a given region. This system also considers the
    phases of growth and development of the crop, the type, and the granulometric
    composition of the soil. Climate data is one of the main parameters, both in classical
    models such as AQUACROP and in models using artificial neural networks to predict
    crop water demand and water availability. In the developed system, a multilayer
    neural network model with input, hidden, and output layers were used. For training,
    the Resilient Propagation method was used, which has proven itself well in this
    kind of problem. Our work considers several criteria when creating an irrigation
    map. In addition to the standard ones, such as humidity, temperature, etc. we
    consider the current state of the crop itself relative to the planned one and
    the presence of indicator plants. The neural network we use (Figure 7) was trained
    using a sample labeled by agronomists based on many years of research on the dependence
    of the state of the crop on the moisture deficit for a given climatic zone. For
    each specific case from the sample, they compared the irrigation correction factor.
    The HOG descriptor in the monitoring system was not chosen by chance in our work.
    One of the main advantages over other descriptors is that it is very resistant
    to lighting changes. Its performance changes slightly in the conditions in which
    shooting is usually done. FIGURE 7. The process of obtaining a map of irrigation
    of crops for corn: a) map of deviation of the real development of corn plants
    from the norm; b) a map of the location of indicator plants; c) current NDWI;
    d) water availability variability map; e) maps of irrigation of crops for corn.
    Show All Based on the results obtained using the HOG - BOVW - BPNN method and
    binarization according to the ExGR - CNN index, the growth stages of plants caught
    in the camera lens are determined. These data are compared with the planned indicators
    for the given area. Figure 7 (a) presents the results of the deviation in development
    from the planned indicators for 10–15 days of growth (6 plant’s leaf). Figure
    7 (a) shows the center of the reference scale. Each new division differs from
    the previous one by 1 day of vegetation. The scale is not limited to five values
    and extends both in one direction and in the other direction. The yellow area
    is normal, the red area indicates a lag in plant development from the norm, and
    the green areas are ahead. Our model also considers the distribution of indicator
    plants over figure 7(b). The yellow area corresponds to an area with an undetected
    predominance of plants that prefer moist soils and dry-loving ones. In terms of
    numbers, this is either a complete absence of both types of plants or, the overweight
    of one of the types is no more than two times. This corresponds to a value of
    3 on the scale figure 7(b). Other values are determined according to the principle:
    prevalence of moisture-loving over dry-loving in the range from 2 to 4 times;
    prevalence of moisture-loving over dry-loving in the range from 4 to 8 times;
    etc. Similarly, zones with a predominance of dry-loving plants are determined.
    Another element that we will consider when planning the irrigation of the field
    is NDWI figure 7(c). We receive the current value of this indicator once every
    10 days. To establish the correct irrigation regime, we created a neural network
    that, using previous NDWI results and weather reports, predicts the dynamic variability
    of water availability for some time ahead. All parameters supplied to the neural
    network are presented in numerical values: NDWI color gradations are set according
    to the standard. They are converted into numerical values in the range from 0
    to 1, where 0 is white (lack of moisture in the soil), 1 is dark blue (wetland).
    Intermediate values are calculated according to the shades of blue. Cloudiness
    is determined by discrete values from its absence - 0, to complete obscurity of
    the sun’s clouds - 3. Air humidity - relative humidity ranging from 0 to 100%
    Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. Wind speed is measured in meters per
    second. When training the neural network, we used NDWI data in size (100 images),
    data from weather stations for the period of the NDWI study. The neural network
    was trained using the Resilient Propagation method [56]. At the final stage of
    obtaining a map of watering corn, data from steps 1 and 2 are passed through the
    second neural network, which determines the lack of moisture in the soil. This
    neural network was trained using the Resilient Propagation method [55] Based on
    the dataset obtained in the experimental farm ≪ Povolgy ≫ of the Saratov State
    Agrarian University in 2020 and previously marked by agronomical scientists. The
    result of the network is a map of the field, divided into sections, indicating
    the amount of water required to irrigate 1 square meter of this section of the
    field. Considering the peculiarities of the sprinkler system, the whole field
    was divided into sectors figure 7(e). The parameters of each sector were determined
    based on the parameters of the sections of which it consists of. On this map,
    the yellow area is the base area. It determines the average amount of moisture
    required for a given field. The red area means that this sector requires more
    moisture than average, the green area requires less moisture relative to the norm.
    The distribution of percentages of the total area under the influence of the prescription
    in each irrigation plan with a dynamic prescription for 6 irrigation actions is
    shown in Figure 8. FIGURE 8. Distribution of percentages of the total area under
    the influence of the dynamic prescription. Show All Computer vision’s-based monitoring
    allows for a dynamic assessment of the actual state of culture and depending on
    the stage of development. Along with the forecast of water availability, this
    makes it possible to overestimate the irrigation rate. So, for example, for irrigation
    actions 5-6, which corresponded to August-September, zones were identified where
    the culture reached late stages of growth and, as a result, a decrease in the
    amount of irrigation is possible, in contrast to standard prescriptions, as can
    be seen in Figure 8. We carried out a comparative analysis of water consumption
    when implementing a standard irrigation strategy and a variable irrigation strategy
    based on dynamic prescription maps. Let us introduce the notation: P i − standard
    irrigation rate corresponding to the i-th irrigation action. S – the area of irrigation
    plot, S j – part of the area of the irrigation plot under the influence of the
    prescription j. S= ∑ 5 j=1 S j (11) View Source Then the irrigation amount with
    standard irrigation, corresponding to the i-th irrigation action. IA i st =S P
    i (12) View Source Irrigation amount with dynamic prescription, corresponding
    to the i-th irrigation action. IA i D = ∑ 5 j=1 S j ( k i j P i ), (13) View Source
    where k i j – irrigation correction factor for S j , corresponding to the i-th
    irrigation action, k i j ={0,8;0,9;1;1,1;1,2} . Irrigation correction factor k
    i j is a numerical expression of the dynamic prescription map obtained as a result
    of the third step of the algorithm. Further development of the method involves
    an increase in the set of k i j values, which will lead to an improvement in the
    efficiency of irrigation water use and productivity. The decrease in the amount
    of irrigation water (in%) because of the implementation of a variable irrigation
    strategy instead of the standard one can be calculated because of maps of dynamic
    prescriptions, the number of irrigation measures, and the established correction
    factors based on (11)-(13). The data of experimental studies of the volume of
    irrigation with standard irrigation and the volume of irrigation with dynamic
    irrigation for the purpose show an increase in this indicator in each irrigation
    action from 0.3% to 1.8%, which gives an increase in total for all irrigations
    of 7.4%. At the same time, the efficiency of the use of irrigation water, which
    links the yield of crops per unit of water used, increases due to an increase
    in yield by 8.9%. SECTION IV. Discussion The irrigation technique plays an important
    role both in the condition of irrigated land and in improving the efficiency of
    agricultural production on irrigated land. In Russia, as well as on a global scale,
    about 22 -23% of CPI systems are used. One method for irrigation management is
    VRI, but the high implementation and management costs limit its application. On
    the one hand, the recently appeared agribusiness management systems such as “Agrosignal”
    allow collecting huge amounts of data, and on the other hand, even the simplest
    analogs of CPI systems have control panels with speed control modules, which makes
    it possible to implement inexpensive irrigation control systems … For this, it
    is necessary to develop maps of irrigation prescriptions that consider the spatial-temporal
    variability of the irrigation site. The purpose of this study was to develop neural
    network methods for determining dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions for automatic
    speed control using 1) phytoindication based on computer vision of the states
    of crops; 2) phytoindication based on computer vision of the state of the soil
    by plants - indicators; 3) intellectual analysis of data from monitoring systems
    of environmental conditions, the water indices, as well as the knowledge base
    of the optimal parameters of irrigation of crops in the region. The question of
    defining irrigation zones is fundamental in this kind of research [13], [14].
    From a formal point of view, the difference in approaches depends on the sets
    of available data, methods, and tools for their analysis. In [12], three main
    areas are indicated: measurements of soil electrical conductivity, monitoring
    of vegetation indices based on satellite images, and data on yield. The study
    [12], was based on mapping the NDVI at a certain time for different purposes.
    From the point of view of methods, artificial intelligence methods were used to
    calculate important parameters of irrigation, such as soil moisture and salinity,
    modeling the water-soil regime and the transfer of solutes [41]–[44]. However,
    all these approaches have drawbacks and require further research. There is an
    acute issue of the need to create maps of prescriptions in dynamics since the
    state of plants and the environment has a high dynamic of changes. The so-called
    dynamic spatial-temporal adaptation is needed. And the accuracy of such adaptation
    can be achieved only by using a combination of artificial intelligence methods.
    In our study, to determine dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions for automatic
    speed control, we used the methods of artificial neural networks, data mining,
    and phytoindication based on computer vision of the state of crops and the state
    of the soil by plants - indicators. Our model is field-tested in 2020. The key
    factors in assessing the impact of an irrigation strategy are crop yields and
    the amount of irrigation water used. An 8.9% increase in corn yields was recorded
    compared to a plot using conventional irrigation. In addition, the data indicate
    an improvement in the efficiency of irrigation water use. The limitation of this
    study is the impossibility of assessing the productivity of each site through
    the yield map, which will be done in the future. Phytoindications based on computer
    vision of the state of the soil by plants - indicators can be an additional simple
    and cheap tool for analyzing the state of the soil in contrast to the rather expensive
    and not always available to farmers methods of chemical analysis. This study demonstrates
    the possibility of widespread use of artificial intelligence methods, contrary
    to the opinion about the complexity and high cost of such solutions. Further research
    will focus on scaling the results for different farms and climatic conditions
    with a full assessment of economic efficiency. SECTION V. Conclusion Climate change
    has direct implications for the availability of water, which requires the development
    of strategies to optimize its use. Conventional irrigation systems are based on
    the application of a uniform flow across the field, considered as a single spatial
    unit. However, fields can often have spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics,
    relief, microclimate, and crop development. Improving the efficiency of water
    use is one of the main tasks facing the heads of farms today. A large area of
    crops with a pivot irrigation system both in Russia and in the world requires
    a differentiated response to irrigation management. The study is focused on the
    development of neural network methods (from multilayer artificial neural networks
    to pattern recognition and convolutional neural networks) to optimize irrigation
    by creating dynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions using 1) regular monitoring
    of the state of crops and the environment through phytoindication; 3) predicting
    the dynamic variability of the state of water supply, as well as a knowledge base
    on the optimal parameters of irrigation of crops in the region. Since agribusiness
    management systems, such as the “Agrosignal” system we use, are now often used
    by farmers, the use of complex methods of artificial intelligence is becoming
    more accessible. The results of the implementation showed a positive trend in
    decreasing spatial variability and increasing corn yields in this field. Sensor
    information, remote sensing, and neural network techniques have proven to be effective
    in defining dynamic control zones and are attractive due to the ease with which
    they can be implemented at the field scale. This relatively simple approach is
    quite inexpensive for the farmer and can be implemented on a large scale, which
    represents an important and sustainable contribution to improving water use efficiency
    in agriculture, especially in the current scenario of global warming and decreasing
    available water for agriculture. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  analysis: 'The paper, titled "Irrigation pivot-center connected at low cost for
    the reduction of crop water requirements," focuses on the integration of sensors,
    GIS (Geographic Information System), and cloud computing to optimize water use
    in irrigation systems. The proposed automated system utilizes LoRa and 4G connectivity
    to collect weather data and soil moisture at various depths. This data is then
    used to calculate crop water requirements and adjust the irrigation schedule in
    real-time. The key points addressed in the paper include:


    - **Different data types for irrigation management:** The paper emphasizes the
    significance of acquiring various data types, such as soil moisture, canopy temperature,
    and weather parameters, for effective irrigation management. These data are crucial
    for understanding the crop''s water needs and tailoring the irrigation schedule
    accordingly.

    - **Data collection and automation:** The authors highlight the advantages of
    using sensors and IoT (Internet of Things) for automated data collection. Sensors
    placed at different depths measure soil moisture, while a weather station records
    weather parameters. This automated data collection process enables real-time monitoring
    of crop water requirements.

    - **Proposed architecture for irrigation management:** The paper introduces a
    cloud-based IoT architecture that integrates data from sensors and weather stations.
    This architecture utilizes Druid, Apache Kafka, and Apache Samza for data processing
    and storage, allowing for real-time analysis of irrigation needs. Solenoid valves
    are employed to control the flow of water to individual sprinklers based on the
    calculated water requirements.

    - **Comparison with CropWat:** The paper compares the water requirements calculated
    by the proposed system with those obtained using CropWat, a widely used decision
    support tool for irrigation scheduling. The results show good agreement between
    the two approaches, indicating the accuracy of the proposed system in estimating
    crop water needs.

    - **Future research directions:** The authors suggest several avenues for future
    research, including the use of 3D cameras for digital phenotyping, sound analysis
    for equipment diagnostics, and the integration of artificial intelligence for
    enhanced data analysis and prediction. The paper effectively highlights the importance
    of data-driven irrigation management and provides a detailed framework for implementing
    an automated system that can optimize water use and crop yields.'

    Irrigation, particularly pivot-center, is widely used around the world to fill
    the need of crop watering. This method of irrigation has a low efficiency compared
    to other methods of irrigation such as drip systems and generally they use water
    without consider the real need of plants. In this paper we propose an automation
    system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and quasi real-time in the cloud of water requirements to improve the efficiency
    of water use. Indeed, each segment of the pivot-center moves at a different speed
    compared to others; thus, must be individually controlled to optimize the yield
    of irrigation. Moreover, it necessary to integrate factors such as stage of crops''
    development, heterogeneity of soil, runoff, drainage, soil components, nutrients
    and moisture content. In this paper we develop a complete system integrating sensors,
    GIS, Internet of Things and cloud computing. This approach allows to automate
    fine-grained the consumption of water without decreasing the yield. In addition
    to that, the collect of data and the soil moisture measurement will allow to adapt
    coefficient of evapotranspiration to local weather without having to resort to
    lysimetric measures. The proposed architecture allows to store and treat real-time,
    time series data and low-priority data such as 3D images used in digital phenotyping
    field which are treated with batch processing. Published in: 2018 International

    Morocco SECTION I. Introduction The demand of food production and fiber increase
    with de world population. The irrigation management is important particularly
    in context where the fresh water resources are limited. The aim of the irrigation
    is to give to plants the adequate amount of water to ensure their water requirements.
    The use of Water Production Function (WPF) allows to estimate the production in
    terms of dry matter or marketable yield, evapotranspiration ore the amount of
    applied water during irrigation (IW). According to the different production functions
    of IW may also include different components in addition to Crop Water Requirement
    (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to prepare the seeding, leaching requirement
    to decrease the salinity, rise of water table by capillarity and rainfall. The
    estimation of water requirement is a stone corner which you can calculate the
    correct irrigation doses. Indeed, the water available for the crop is an indicator
    of the texture of soil, precipitations, previous irrigations, state of development
    of crop and the amount of water already present in the soil. Center-Pivot of irrigation
    are usually reserved to irrigate large areas from 3.5 to 65 ha because of the
    costs; but, the nutrients, fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide and pesticide can
    be directly applied on the canopy of crop [1]. Center-Pivot irrigation systems
    require up to 40% less water application than traditional and conventional gravity
    (furrow) or surface irrigation methods, where a part of water is lost by percolation
    or runoff. But Center-pivot irrigation stays less effective than the drip systems
    that are the most economical in term of water. The main challenge is related to
    the exact estimation of both the evapotranspiration of the crop and how to bring
    the water (frequency and quantity). Traditional hand-feel soil measurement methods
    do not provide quantitative soil water and real-time data. The use of sensors
    in precision agriculture is becoming widespread, especially in irrigation and
    open the field of irrigation management in order to establish an optimal timing
    and amount of irrigation water for greatest effectiveness. Indeed, an optimal
    irrigation management avoid water deficiency and use too much water that reduces
    the potential for profitability of the crop. The supply of an optimal amount of
    water allows also to maximize the yield response to other management practices,
    optimize yield per unit of water applied, reduce the potential runoff, reduce
    soil erosion and pesticide movement into the surface and ground water [1]. To
    optimize the yield and soil water in the crop, plants should not pass the wilting
    point. This means the minimum soil moisture required by a plant not to wilt. At
    this point, any decrease in soil moisture will result in wilting. When a plant
    wilts, its leaves dry out, droop, and wither. The coupling of the irrigation system
    with a soil moisture monitoring and an accurate evapotranspiration calculation
    has a significant advantage in term of water consumption. Precision agriculture
    (PA) uses the Internet of Things and allows real-time control measure and automation
    of pivot-center irrigation systems. Furthermore, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN)
    is affordable and the wide availability of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol
    such as LoRa, SigFox and Ingenu coupling with cloud IoT platforms pave the way
    of high precision and realtime irrigation management systems. In this paper, we
    combine agronomic and computer science expertise to propose a cloud IoT architecture
    and a network of sensors using LPWA to control, monitor and optimize the crop
    production at quasi real-time. The low-cost sensor network measure on one hand
    the weather data required to calculate potential evapotranspiration of the crop,
    and on other hand the soil moisture at different depths. The proposed architecture
    calculates water requirements of plants and actuate solenoids to open and close
    water individually each sprinkler. SECTION II. Literature Review The main challenges
    in the elaboration of an automated irrigation system for irrigation pivot-center
    are vital; on one hand to choose an adapted evaluation method of water requirements,
    and on other hand to identify a correct cloud IoT platform essential for data
    storage and treatment. The following paragraph focuses on these aspects and on
    reviewing existing works. A. Related Works Classical Water Production Functions
    (WPF) are useful tools for irrigation management and economic analysis of yield
    reduction due to deficit irrigation which is usually based on linear regression
    and don''t give a representation of nonlinear behaviors of complex ecological
    systems. To fix this issue recent research are investigated. We list the use of
    more robust and nonlinear techniques such as machine learning, Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) and data-mining tools (e.g. Fortin et al in 2010 [2], Dai et al.
    in 2011 [3], Haghverdi et al. in 2014 [4] and Elnesr et al., in 2016 [5]). In
    this study we follow two different controls. The first model consists to control
    the speed of travelling of the central-pivot for a constant flow rate. The second
    uses an electronic control to adapt flow rate in the nozzles. The speed of travelling
    of the central-pivot is maintained constant. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    allows to save 9-19% of irrigation water and to address field-level spatio-temporal
    heterogeneity in terms of soil water holding capacity and depth of soil [6]. According
    to Pan et al in 2013 [7] VRI allows also to enhance water-use efficiency, improve
    productivity, reduce fuel consummation and reduce nutrient leaching. The choice
    of sprinkler package, the pressure of working, meteorological conditions and tower
    dynamics affect the irrigation water distribution pattern [8]. Moreover, variations
    in micro-meteorological and technical conditions can modify the water application
    depth and irrigation uniformity at different lateral positions with flow control
    nozzles or pressure regulators at each head [8]. Wind speed and direction don''t
    significantly modify the uniformity of water applicatIon but impact the absolute
    application depth of zones under VRI management [9]. To adapt flow of irrigation
    soils moisture measure must be done. Traditional soil moisture sensors need to
    be installed early in the growing season and must be removed before the harvesting.
    Dong et al in 2013 [1] has proposed a cyber-physical system based on underground
    sensors to monitor soil moisture but this approach do not monitor soil on only
    one depth [1]. The interest of the coupling of Geographic Information System (GIS)
    and Remote Sensing (RS) with Internet of Things (IoT) has been demonstrated by
    different authors such as Li et al. in 2012 [10] Ye et al. in 2013 [11] Wang et
    al., 2013 [12]. B. Estimations of Water Requirements The estimation of water requirements
    of crop (ETc) can be estimated from a simple soil water balance (SSWB) model.
    A general form of the soil water balance is done by the following equation: ETc=I+P+F+R+ΔS
    (1) View Source Where I is the irrigation dose [mm], P is the precipitation [mm],
    F is the net subsurface flow into the control volume [mm], R is net runoff or
    runon to the control volume surface [mm] and ΔS is the net change in soil water
    stored in the control volume [mm]. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) can
    be calculated by using different methods. A common one requires several weather
    data that are not all the time available. Among these methods, we mention Penman-Monteith
    [13] FAO56 PM) which ranked as the best method for estimating daily and monthly
    ET for all climates. Penman [14] (FAO24), Penman [15] (FAO-ppp-17), Kimberly-Penman
    [16], Hamon [17], Hargreaves [18], Haude [19], Penman [20], Penman-Monteith [21],
    Priestley-Taylor [22], Makkink [23], McCl [24], De Bruin-Keijman [25] (DK), Jensen-Haise
    [16], Blaney-Criddle [26] (BC), Blaney-Criddle [14] (FAO 24 BC), FAO 24 Radiation
    [14], Turc [27], Wendling [28], Valiantzas [29]. Nevertheless, modern technologies
    such as the use of Wireless Infrared Thermometers (IRT) appear to measure surface
    temperature and determine the ETc [30]. A comparison of 16 among the models mentioned
    above has been carried out by Liu et al. in 2017 [31] and have shown that FAO-ppp-17,
    Pen-63 and FAO-24 BC are the better results in semi-arid climate. Therefore, we
    notice that a poor calibration between all the aforementioned researchers lead
    to inconsistent results of existing studies on weighting lysimeter. Indeed, Jensen
    et al. report that FA024BC is better [32]. While Yoder et al. in 2005 [33] and
    Lépez-Urrea et al. in 2006 [34] find that FA056 PM is the better formula. Otherwise
    some authors such as Berengena et al. in 2005 [35], Howell et al. in 1998 [36]
    have proven that the adjustment of the Penman formula coefficients at local scale
    shows significantly performing results. To conclude, we assume that FA056 PM or
    FA024 BC can be tested as a first approach in the evaluation of the evapotranspiration
    and a precise evaluation can be obtained locally by adjusting the parameters of
    the original Penman equation. The local adjustment of coefficient of the Penman
    formula need the use of lysimeters and a long experimentation which is not always
    achievable out of research centres. The Maximal Evapotranspiration (MET) of a
    crop can be calculated at different vegetative stage when amount of water is sufficiently
    available and agronomic condition are optimal. The MET can be calculated by model
    but in real conditions, and the Real Evapotranspiration (RE) is inferior in amount
    calculated by model. By consequence, it''s important to measure accurately real
    evapotranspiration by mean of sensors to provide the necessary quantities of water
    and to avoid percolation losses related to excessive intake linked in particular
    to an overestimation of the actual evapotranspiration. C. Choice of Sensors Both
    approaches can be followed. The first one uses commercial sensing solutions which
    natively provide a wide range of features directly and allows researchers to focus
    on the developments of algorithms and meta-processing, etc. The second one uses
    open hardware solutions which are programmable and flexible allowing to developers
    to have the full control of the behaviors of the nodes [37] The first approach
    is particularly interesting to develop proof of concept but makes researchers
    dependent of one provider and the availability of sensors used for development.
    Moreover, the rapid turnover of product of high technology renders this science
    stream especially risked for long term developments. The second way although requiring
    further development is more sustainable and is generally supported by a large
    community of developers. The choice of sensors is crucial because nodes can move
    over time that causes considerable interferences in the communication between
    nodes. Moreover, the influence of temperature, humidity, rainfall, sandstorm and
    high solar radiation greatly affect the links and communication quality among
    the nodes, particularly in harsh environmental conditions. The high temperature
    encountered in semiarid environments affects significantly the received signal
    strength (RSS). The humidity linked to the irrigation system and the heavy rainfall
    intensely affects the propagation of radio waves. The choice of the wireless transceiver
    and the transmission protocol must take into account the number of nodes, the
    distances between them, the height of antenna and the operating frequency based
    on the desired size of payload [37]. D. Cloud IoT Platform The correct choice
    of the IoT Platform to build a solution can affect the overall success of the
    project [37]. Both explorable approaches acquire and manage the underlying hardware
    and software layers or use a commercial offering which provides all needed services
    to propose an integrative solution. A review proposed by Ray PP in 2016 compare
    the 26 most popular IoT cloud platforms based on the following parameters: deployment
    service, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data
    management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization and research.
    According to Ray in 2016 [38], they should have at least 49 IoT cloud platforms
    present in the actual global market. Nowadays, any commercial or open source cloud
    platform allows to deploy, and hosts applications or models elaborated on different
    framework on the same cloud architecture. SECTION III. Calculation of Water Requirements
    The soil characterization has been achieved on basis of samples taken in situ
    by BNEDER (National Technical Studies Office for Rural Development) located at
    Alger (Algeria). 96 samples were taken following a systematic grid of 30 × 30
    m over the area covered by the pivot (one by layer of soil). The parameters evaluated
    were bulk density, texture and the soil water holding capacity. Then, parameters
    measured on each of the 32 sampling points for three layers of soil has been interpolated
    to obtain a high-resolution map. The software ArcMap 10.5.1 was used to interpolate
    data measured in order to generate a grid by layer of 5m × 5m (25m2 area per cell)
    for each kind of measure. Moreover, each layer of soil has also been interpolate
    using 3D spline method to obtain a 3D model of soil layer. This 3D model and the
    spatial interpolation of soil water holding capacity allows to calculate the plant
    available in function of the depth of rooting. As shown on Fig. 1. The first layer
    is a mix of one or more existing layers which have been homogenized from a textural
    point of view and the salt content by successive plowing on a height of 25 to
    30 cm. The water available for plant is also function of roots development which
    offers the possibility to explore a more and more large part of soil. The available
    water is obtained by a weighted mean of the depth of all layers explored by the
    root system at each stage of development. A day by day amount of water irrigation
    can be calculated from (1). Fig. 1 Different stages of crop development Show All
    The FAO Penman-Monteith method (2) is used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) and the evapo-transpiration of the crop (ETc), also named MET which takes
    into account the stage of vegetative growth of the crop by weighting the potential
    evapotranspiration by the coefficient Kc [13]. The Kc coefficient allows to modulate
    the PET in function of the crop envisaged and the stage of its stage of development.

    of the crop is calculated with (3). ETc= PET ∗ Kc (3) View Source Where ETc is
    the crop evapotranspiration [mm.day''], PET is the reference evapotranspiration
    [mm.day−1] and Kc is a ponderation coefficient variating between 0.3 to 1.2 depending
    of the crop stage of development [8], see Fig 1. SECTION IV. Material The application
    is tested on a pivot-center irrigation and a crop of soft wheat implanted in Ain
    Salah located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region in the center of Algeria.
    This region is characterized by a hot desert climate where the temperature in
    the summer reach 47 to 50°C. The irrigation pivot-center is composed of 6 spans
    with a total length of 308m. The revolution time of the pivot is 24h, it means
    that every hour an angle of 15° is traveled. As shown in the Fig. 2, the cover
    area is increasing from the center to the outside. The sensors must stay functional
    with important temperature variation from 20 to 65 degrees and remained functional
    also in presence of rate of humidity close to 80%. Fig. 3 The proposed system
    and architecture Show All SECTION V. Proposed System and Archttecture We have
    chosen to follow the open hardware way as part of our developments. The proposed
    system is composed locally of a weather station. Several multi-depth moisture
    sensors distributed on the irrigate area at the middle on each span measure the
    amount of water at different depths and solenoid placed on sprinkler. Data are
    transmitted by LoRa modulation to a gateway which relay data to The Things Network
    using a 4G connection. A cloud architecture collects, treats and stores data received
    from the weather station and soil moisture sensor, and calculates in real-time
    needs in irrigation water. A. Weather Station The weather data are acquired by
    a micro weather station which uses a LoRa transmission system. This low-cost protocol
    has been chosen for its easiness of deployment, its ability to resist interference
    with the spread spectrum technology and the area that can be covered by a single
    gateway. The micro weather station is based on a Weather Sensor (Argent Data Systems)
    which contains an anemometer, a vane direction and a pluviometer. The weather
    station contains a temperature / humidity sensor AM2315 (Aosong) with an error
    of 0.1°C for the temperature and 2% for the relative humidity. The net solar radiation
    is measured by a digital net radiometer SN-500, Apogee Instruments. All sensors
    are connected on a LoPy which collect data and send them on LoRa / 4G gateway
    (see Fig. 3). B. Sensors and Actuators Soil moisture nodes based on LoPy using
    soil moisture underground sensors measure the rate of humidity at different soil
    depths. The humidity is measured at different depth (20, 30 and 50 cm) with Watermark
    Soil Moisture Irrometer sensor model 200SS. The measure of humidity at different
    depth allow to control if amount of water calculate are correct or if they must
    be adjusted. As show on Fig. 2, the 24 sensors are implanted in the middle of
    each ring, the water requirements are controlled 8 times per day (one just before
    the irrigation and one hour just after the irrigation) on each of the four control
    lines of sensors. Solenoid valves are implanted on the sprinkler feed pipes and
    allows them to be operated individually and thus finely control the water supply.
    The fine control of the sprinklers allows to have a same amount of water per unit
    area at each of the 6 zones traveled at the level of each of the different segments
    each hour. C. Cloud Architecture We use our own architecture based on a Cloud
    IoT platform and a share/hosting application platform. This architecture has already
    been tested with cattle behavior [39], digital phenotyping [40] and monitoring
    of bee health [41]. Time-related Data are transmitted to the Cloud IoT platform
    by LPWA network while images, videos and sound are transmitted by Wi-Fi network,
    see Fig. 3. 1) The Cloud IoT Platform The platform is composed of two parts. The
    first one is based on one hand on Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Druid, to treat
    stream and time-related data. The second one uses an Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark
    are associate to store and treat images, sound and video. a) Time Related-Data
    Data are received by Apache Kafka which transfer them to Apache Samza to be processed
    before the ingesting by Druid. Druid is a distributed column -oriented fault-tolerant
    data store presenting real-time analytical capabilities. The data processing allows
    to increase the speed of ingestion 10 times by elimination of bad formed package,
    inconsistent and incomplete data. Redis Caching accelerate the speed of recurrent
    queries. The data are stored in units of few millions of lines named ‘segments’
    composed of 5 to 10 million of times-stamped events compressed by LZ4. Old segments
    are locally stored on HDFS. Both external dependencies are used: PostgreSQL and
    ZooKeeper to respectively store meta data and monitor the four kinds of nodes
    present in the cluster. These four types of nodes coordinate, broke, store in
    real-time or archive data in the distributed data store. b) Sound, Images and
    Video These kinds of data are independently treated and stored by a second structure
    based on Hadoop and Apache Spark. These kinds of data are also locally stored
    on HDFS. This structure offers better performance than an Hadoop, MapReduce, HiPi.
    Camera placed on the pivot center can make 3D-pictures of same plant every day
    in order to model their development and compare the impact of agricultural practices
    and weather conditions on the growth of the crop. The analysis of sound allows
    to detect any dysfunction may occur of critical parts of pivot-center and program
    a preventive maintenance (PM) to avoid the immobilization of the pivot over a
    long period. But both features are not yet implemented. 2) The Application Sharing
    and Hosting Platform Druid powers high performances application with low query
    latencies. To better exploit this performance and don''t be dependent of one SDK,
    we propose a cloud architecture able to host application developed on principal
    framework. This cloud platform authorizes elaboration of the model by researchers
    and also host endpoint applications of third party adapted to different kinds
    of material allowing to monitor and automate the pivot-center irrigation while
    optimizing crop yields. SECTION VI. Results We compare water requirements calculated
    by the cloud architecture with the one calculated by CropWat [42] decision support
    tool. This tool is developed by the Land and Water Development Division for the
    calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil,
    climate and crop data. The calculation procedure is described in [8], the response
    of different yield is explained in [43] and the coupling between CropWat and climatic
    data of ClimWat is explicated step by step in [44]. Remarkably values calculated
    by CropWat assume that only water can change and other factors such as agricultural
    practices, fertilization, etc. are at optimal level. Table 1 gives results obtained
    with CropWat 8.0 for a wheat with a planting date of 25 November at In Salah,
    Algeria and total development in 180 days. Water requirements are calculated on
    basis of real daily weather data. Table I. Water requirements calculated with
    cropwat The Fig. 4 shows the comparison between measured and calculated with CropWat
    Potential Evapotranspiration (ETP). Both approach gives similar results. SECTION
    VII. Conclusion and Future Works We have outlined an architecture based on soil
    characteristics interpolate by mean of GIS, soil moisture measured, and weather
    data transmitted by LoRaWan to calculate in quasi real-time the water requirements
    of the crop. The LoRaWan is particularly adapted to transmit data in harsh conditions.
    In the end, the comparison of first approach performed with CropWat has allowed
    to calculate maximal evapotranspiration and verify that these are never exceeded.
    Fig. 4 Comparison between CropWat and measured average daily ETP Show All In order
    to validate the water requirements calculated using the CropWat model, we compared
    them with a precise model called AquaCrop [45]. This model considers more parameters
    affecting the vegetative and reproductive growth of crop. The implementation of
    3D Camera in specific areas places on the pivot, will open a new research path
    in the field of digital phenotyping. In addition to this, the continuous analysis
    of sound from microphones implemented in chosen places will quickly detect signs
    of failure and prevent downtime that can be expensive in term of crop profitability.
    As future work, we plan to exploit GPU Tegra Mobile Processors 1 that offers high
    computation power thanks to the exploitation of GPU processors in parallel [46]
    [47]. In addition to the high performance, these cards provide the possibility
    to exploit artificial intelligence algorithms for a better training and prediction
    of collected data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank our colleagues from Biosystems

  limitations: While the paper presents a comprehensive overview of the proposed automated
    irrigation system, it lacks specific details and experimental results on scalability,
    reliability, and long-term performance of the system. Furthermore, the evaluation
    of the system's effectiveness in reducing water consumption and improving crop
    yields is limited to a comparison with CropWat, which assumes optimal conditions.
    In-field experimentation and data on water savings and yield improvements would
    strengthen the findings of the study.

    and Fernanda Duarte\n*a\nPredictive molecular simulations require fast, accurate\
    \ and reactive interatomic potentials. Machine\nlearning oﬀers a promising approach\
    \ to construct such potentials by ﬁtting energies and forces to high-\nlevel quantum-mechanical\
    \ data, but doing so typically requires considerable human intervention and\n\
    data volume. Here we show that, by leveraging hierarchical and active learning,\
    \ accurate Gaussian\nApproximation Potential (GAP) models can be developed for\
    \ diverse chemical systems in an autonomous\nmanner, requiring only hundreds to\
    \ a few thousand energy and gradient evaluations on a reference\npotential-energy\
    \ surface. The approach uses separate intra- and inter-molecular ﬁts and employs\n\
    a prospective error metric to assess the accuracy of the potentials. We demonstrate\
    \ applications to\na range of molecular systems with relevance to computational\
    \ organic chemistry: ranging from bulk\nsolvents, a solvated metal ion and a metallocage\
    \ onwards to chemical reactivity, including a bifurcating\nDiels–Alder reaction\
    \ in the gas phase and non-equilibrium dynamics (a model SN2 reaction) in explicit\n\
    solvent. The method provides a route to routinely generating machine-learned force\
    \ ﬁelds for reactive\nmolecular systems.\nIntroduction\nMolecular simulations\
    \ are a cornerstone in computational\nchemistry, providing dynamical insights\
    \ beyond experimental\nresolution.1 Realistic simulations of (bio)chemical reactions\n\
    require the inclusion of the chemical environment where they\noccur (e.g. solvent\
    \ and/or enzyme) and oen extended time-\nscales.\nTherefore,\ngeneration\nof\n\
    accurate\nand\neﬃcient\napproaches has been central to the development of this\
    \ eld.\nEmpirical interatomic potentials (force elds), in combina-\ntion with\
    \ molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations, have been widely used\
    \ to sample the potential-\nenergy surface (PES). However, they are limited in\
    \ accuracy\nand transferability.2 Moreover, most of these potentials are\nparameterised\
    \ for isolated entities with xed connectivity and\nthus unable to describe bond\
    \ breaking/forming processes. In\ncontrast, ab initio methods provide an accurate\
    \ description of\nthe PES, which is particularly critical for reactions in solution.\n\
    However, because of their high computational cost and unfav-\nourable scaling\
    \ behaviour, they are limited to a few hundred\natoms and simulation times of\
    \ picoseconds in ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) at the DFT level, and practically\n\
    impossible at the computational ‘gold-standard’ [CCSD(T)].3\nMachine learning\
    \ (ML) approaches have the potential to\nrevolutionise force-eld based simulations,\
    \ aiming to provide\nthe best of both worlds,4–6 and have indeed begun to provide\n\
    new insights into a range of challenging research problems.7–16\nThe development\
    \ of an ML potential applicable to the whole\nperiodic table mapping nuclear coordinates\
    \ to total energies\nand forces is, however, precluded by the curse of dimension-\n\
    ality. Within small chemical subspaces, models can be achieved\nusing neural networks\
    \ (NNs),6,17–21 kernel-based methods such\nas the Gaussian Approximation Potential\
    \ (GAP) framework22,23\nor gradient-domain machine learning (GDML),24 and linear\n\
    tting with properly chosen basis functions,25,26 each with\ndiﬀerent data requirements\
    \ and transferability.27 GAPs have\nbeen used to study a range of elemental,28–30\
    \ multicomponent\ninorganic,31,32\ngas-phase\norganic\nmolecular,13,33\nand\n\
    more\nrecently condensed-phase systems, such as methane34 and\nphosphorus.35 These\
    \ potentials, while accurate, have required\nconsiderable\ncomputational\neﬀort\n\
    and\nhuman\noversight.\nIndeed, condensed-phase NN36,37 and GAP tting approaches\n\
    typically require several thousand reference (“ground truth”)\nevaluations.\n\
    Active learning (AL), where new training data is added based\non the current state\
    \ of the potential, has been used for gener-\nating databases and accelerating\
    \ the tting process.31,38–42\nNotable examples in materials modelling include\

    \ potentials\nbecome even more important when exploring chemical reac-\ntions\
    \ in molecular systems, which oen require a description at\na computational level\
    \ beyond DFT, and therefore require\nreference data at the same level. Very recently,\
    \ AL approaches\nhave started to be adopted for tting reactive potentials for\n\
    organic molecules based on single point evaluations at\nquantum-chemical levels\
    \ of theory. Notable examples include\nthe modelling of gas-phase pericyclic reactions,12\
    \ the explora-\ntion of reactivity during methane combustion,50 and the\ndecomposition\
    \ of urea in water.41\nIn the present work – with a view to developing potentials\
    \ to\nsimulate solution phase reactions – we consider bulk water as\na test case\
    \ and develop a strategy which requires just hundreds\nof total ground truth evaluations\
    \ and no a priori knowledge of\nthe system, apart from the molecular composition.\
    \ We show\nhow this methodology is directly transferable to diﬀerent\nchemical\
    \ systems in the gas phase as well as in implicit and\nexplicit solvent, focusing\
    \ on the applicability to a range of\nscenarios that are relevant in computational\
    \ chemistry.\nResults and discussion\nDespite GAP tting being increasingly used\
    \ for inorganic\nsystems, we found that the same tting strategies did not easily\n\
    transfer to the description of complex molecular environments.\nEven with a high\
    \ correlation and low error on energies in\nunseen test data, some potentials\
    \ were not stable for more than\na few femtoseconds. In the following section,\
    \ we therefore\noutline a training strategy along with a prospective error metric\n\
    to develop robust models for gas-phase and condensed-phase\nmolecular systems.\n\
    A prospective error metric\nThe initial step in validating supervised machine\
    \ learning (ML)\ntends to follow the splitting of a dataset into training and\
    \ test\nsets, training the model, then evaluating its performance on the\ntest\
    \ set with a squared error (RMSE/MSE) or a correlation (R2)\nmetric. As with model\
    \ overtting, this ‘retrospective’ validation\nstrategy ultimately limits the\
    \ applicability of these models.51–57\nIn an ML potential, the minimum required\
    \ domain of appli-\ncability is the region of conguration space likely to be\
    \ sampled\nduring a simulation with the potential. However, this region is\nnot\
    \ known a priori, making the choice of test data problematic if\nnot impossible\
    \ for use in a standard train/test data split\napproach. In addition, one would\
    \ also like to ensure high\naccuracy in regions sampled on the ground truth surface\n\
    (especially for early versions of an evolving potential), but being\nable to quantify\
    \ this accuracy requires dynamics at the ground\ntruth method level in the rst\
    \ place, which is much more\nexpensive than sampling with an eﬃcient potential.\n\
    Using a train/test set split with high structural similarity\nbetween the two\
    \ sets can lead to highly misleadingly accuracy\nwhenever the potential is to\
    \ be taken outside the training region\nin computational practice. For example,\
    \ splitting an AIMD\ntrajectory of water into a training and test set with an\
    \ odd/even\nframe split (50 : 50) and training a simple GAP model yields an\n\
    energy error on the order of 1 kcal mol\x011 (Fig. S1a†). However,\nsimulations\
    \ with this potential in the same conguration space\nsample unphysical congurations\
    \ within 10 fs (Fig. S1b†),\nmaking an RMSE over a priori test data an insuﬃcient\
    \ metric in\nquantifying the quality of a potential.\nConsidering that single-point\
    \ reference energy evaluations\nare reasonably cheap, a ‘prospective’ validation\
    \ scheme is\npossible, where the error metric operates in the conguration\nspace\
    \ sampled in a simulation. With this in mind, we propose\na temporal cumulative\
    \ error metric (sacc, eqn (1)), dened as the\ntime required for the cumulative\
    \ error (absolute diﬀerence\nbetween true (E0) and predicted (EGAP)) to exceed\
    \ a given\nthreshold (ET); the larger sacc, the more robust the potential.\nNote\
    \ that the time for which a potential is stable in MD can far\nexceed sacc, as\
    \ shown in the following. Here only errors above\na lower-bound threshold value\
    \ (El) contribute to the cumulative\nerror. The lower threshold is required to\
    \ account for the\nresidual error that is due to the nite radial cut-oﬀ of the\
    \ model.\nIn the following we take ET to be 10 times El, but it may be\nadjusted\
    \ depending on the simulation context.\nsacc ¼ time : ET\\\nX\ni˛frames\nmax\n\
    \x02\x03\x03E0\ni \x01 EGAP\ni\n\x03\x03 \x01 El; 0\n\x04\n(1)\nThis metric has\
    \ several advantages in that (a) it ensures that\na potential with high accuracy\
    \ will result in stable dynamics; (b)\nit allows the user to specify the level\
    \ of accepted error according\nto the quality of the training method, thus not\
    \ penalising where\nthe error is within the diﬀerence between the ground truth\
    \ and\nthe true PES (i.e. a larger threshold may be suitable for a less\naccurate\
    \ reference method); (c) it penalises large errors, even if\nthey only occur for\
    \ single congurations, which is important as\nsuch errors may lead to instabilities\
    \ in the ML-driven MD\ntrajectory and (d) it enables a quoted accuracy to include\n\
    regions that may not be accessible to direct evaluation at the\nground-truth level\
    \ (e.g. long-time behaviour). Overall, this\nmetric depends on the lower bound\
    \ and total error, interval\nbetween evaluations, and the simulation on which\
    \ it is evalu-\nated; so while not unique, it is – crucially – prospective. We\n\
    found this metric to be essential in developing an eﬃcient\ntraining strategy\
    \ and accurate potentials for bulk water (Fig. 1).\nWater models\nFor bespoke\

    \ in\nmind, here we train GAP models to simulate bulk water, aiming\nto minimise\
    \ the number of required ground truth evaluations\nas well as the required human\
    \ intervention, while maximising\nstability (measured by sacc). A selection of\
    \ training strategies is\ndiscussed in the following paragraphs and their results\
    \ are\noutlined in Fig. 1.\nWe initially employed training strategies found to\
    \ work well\nin elemental materials by, for example, tting a combined\npotential\
    \ with two- and three-body GAPs. However, this\napproach was found to be detrimental\
    \ to the potential's\nstability. This can be understood considering a water dimer\n\
    (HO–Hc/OH2); here, a two-body description that treats the two\nO–Hc interactions\
    \ on the same footing is a poor approximation,\nin view of the diﬀerent order\
    \ of magnitude between the inter-\nactions at their respective minima (Fig. S3†).\
    \ Therefore, we\ndecided to proceed employing a smooth overlap of atomic\npositions58\
    \ (SOAP) descriptor for an exclusively many-body\ndescription of atomic environments\
    \ (with the exception of AL-\nI + I, which uses 2 + 3 body for the intramolecular\
    \ component\nas discussed later).\nWe also explored diﬀerent approaches to generate\
    \ the\ndatabase and their inuence on the generated potential. An\nemerging approach\
    \ to generate training data for elemental\nGAPs is to initialise the database\
    \ with randomised congura-\ntions (with reasonable constraints, as in ab initio\
    \ random\nstructure searching59), and to gradually explore conguration\nspace\
    \ with evolving versions of the potential (see, e.g., ref. 60).\nHowever, randomly\
    \ placing water molecules does not in itself\naﬀord a stable potential. A similar\
    \ result is observed when the\nmost diverse congurations are selected using the\
    \ CUR algo-\nrithm60,61 (Fig. S4†) or when applying intramolecular displace-\n\
    ments, following minimisation (Fig. S4†). Selecting frames from\nclassical MD\
    \ simulations at temperatures of 100–1000 K was\nalso found to be an ineﬀective\
    \ strategy (Fig. S5†), reaching sacc\nof only a few fs (“MM-MD”, Fig. 1c). This\
    \ is in line with the\nresults reported in ref. 13. Note that this is not because\
    \ the GAP\ncannot t reference energies and forces from MM congura-\ntions (Fig.\
    \ S6†), but because of a poor conguration space\noverlap with the ground truth\
    \ PES (Fig. S7†). Selecting cong-\nurations from an AIMD simulation at 300 K\
    \ (AIMD, Fig. 1c) was\nan improvement over training on random and MM-generated\n\
    congurations, with sacc \x03 10 fs. However, by adding addi-\ntional AIMD congurations\
    \ the increase in accuracy saturates\nquickly even if those are obtained at higher\
    \ temperatures\n(Fig.\nS8†).\nUsing\nAIMD\ncongurations\ncan\nalso\ninvolve\n\

    \ a few randomly generated congura-\ntions provides a modest upli in accuracy\
    \ (AL, Fig. 1c), with\naccuracy on-par with GAP trained on AIMD congurations\
    \ at\na third of the required reference data.\nOnly when the relevant length and\
    \ energy scales of the\nsystem are decomposed by treating intra- and inter-molecular\n\
    components separately (Fig. 1b) a potential that is stable for\npicoseconds is\
    \ obtained (AL-I + I, Fig. 1c). We note that this\napproach is related to the\
    \ hierarchical tting of GAPs34,63 and\nrelated ML models33,64–66 using diﬀerent\
    \ levels of computational\napproaches, and the decomposition strategy by Wengert\
    \ and co-\nworkers.67 In the present work, we employ the same ground-\ntruth method\
    \ throughout rather than combining diﬀerent\nlevels of theory for the input data,\
    \ but as in prior studies we\ndescribe the stronger (e.g., covalent) and weaker\
    \ intermolecular\nterms with separate ts that are aerwards combined to give\
    \ the\nnal model. The intramolecular GAP for water contains only 2-\nand 3-body\
    \ terms and the training data are chosen using an\nevenly spaced grid over the\
    \ full 3-atom PES (8 \x04 8 \x04 8 grid\npoints in rOH and rHH, \x030.1 ˚A spacing,\
    \ Fig. S9†). Energy and\nforce evaluations of this potential are a simple sum\
    \ of intra- and\ninter-molecular terms, but require the former to be evaluated\
    \ in\nan\nexpanded\nsimulation\nbox\nto\nensure\nno\nnon-bonded\nhydrogen atoms\
    \ are present within the cut-oﬀ radius of the 2-\nand 3-body descriptors on oxygen\
    \ (Fig. S10†). Here the intra-\nmolecular PES is fairly low-dimensional, so a\
    \ full and reason-\nably dense grid is available, which in turn allows us to dene\
    \ an\nerror measure over the whole PES, where we nd the error to be\ninversely\
    \ correlated with sacc (Fig. 1d). Using an acceptable error\nof 0.2 kcal mol\x01\
    1 per H2O molecule for a description of bulk\nwater, which is similar to that\
    \ achieved in a recent NN t of\nwater,36 we nd that this potential aﬀords sacc\
    \ > 10 ps with just\na few hundred ground truth evaluations (AL-I + I, Fig. 1c).\
    \ To put\nthis value in context, we measured sacc for the fully reactive\nwater\
    \ NN of Cheng et al.,36 which was trained on \x037000 refer-\nence congurations\
    \ (DFTB energy/forces) and has shown to\nprovide a highly accurate water model\
    \ over multiple states. For\nthis state-of-the-art ML potential, a sacc value\
    \ of 7.6 \x05 0.7 ps for\nliquid at 300 K is obtained, comparable to the one obtained\
    \ for\nthe new AL-based potentials of the present work (>10 ps). Of\ncourse, direct\
    \ comparison requires caution because the two\npotentials are diﬀerent in scope:\
    \ the NN potential employs\na large reference database to develop a general water\
    \ model,\nwhereas the present study targets robust potentials for liquid\nwater\
    \ with minimal computational eﬀort, in turn allowing the\nuser to apply similar\
    \ approaches to other chemical systems (as\nwill be shown below).\nThe model tted\
    \ using our approach (AL-I + I) yields radial\ndistribution functions (RDFs) in\
    \ good agreement with the\nground-truth method, initially chosen to be DFTB, both\n\
    considering the location and intensities of the peaks corre-\nsponding to the\
    \ rst and second coordination shells (Fig. 2a–c).\nThis is despite the relatively\
    \ short-range atomic cut-oﬀs (3 ˚A, O\nonly) used. Only in the O–O pair RDF there\
    \ is a slight deviation\nfrom the DFTB ground truth, precisely where the potential\
    \ is\nzero outside the 3 ˚A cut-oﬀ radius of the SOAP descriptor.\nInterestingly,\
    \ for a DFT-quality GAP simply re-evaluating ener-\ngies and forces on DFTB-derived\
    \ active-learnt congurations is\ninsuﬃcient, with the DFTB congurations being\
    \ high in energy\nat the DFT level (\x035 eV, Fig. S11†). However, applying an\
    \ active\nlearning strategy with a PBE reference method and a slightly\nlarger\
    \ 3.5 ˚A cut-oﬀ generates excellent agreement with the AIMD\nsimulation from ref.\
    \ 62, in only a few hours of total training\ntime (Fig. 2d–f). At this level of\
    \ theory, the local structure of\nliquid water is predicted largely correctly,\
    \ with two distinct\npeaks in the O–H RDF, corresponding to rst and second\n\
    solvation shells with the largest deviation from the ground truth\nagain in the\
    \ O–O pair around the descriptor cut-oﬀ. The real\nsignicance, of course, is\
    \ in moving to more accurate ground-\ntruth methods, for which a full MD simulation\
    \ would not be\nstraightforward: indeed, using the same method, a hybrid DFT-\n\
    quality water model can be generated within a few days, which\nwould be inaccessible\
    \ with other methods (the generation of the\nGAP model required \x035 days on\
    \ 20 CPU cores, Fig. 2g–i). These\nresults suggest that the training strategy\
    \ (and hyperparameter\nselection) presented here is suitable independent of the\
    \ refer-\nence method.\nOther solvent systems\nOrganic reactions oen take place\
    \ in solvents other than water.\nUsing an identical training strategy to the one\
    \ described for\nwater, we trained GAPs for a selection of organic solvents with\n\
    various\ntypes\nof\nintermolecular\ninteractions.\nTo\nquickly\ngenerate the reference\
    \ simulation data for this proof-of-\nconcept, a DFTB ground truth is employed;\
    \ chlorinated\nsolvents were not selected due to a large discrepancy between\n\
    the DFTB-generated and experimental C–Cl bond dissociation\nenergy (Fig. S12†).\
    \ A uniform grid over the intramolecular PES is\nnow no longer possible; thus,\
    \ AL is used to develop an initial\nintramolecular potential trained using GAP-MD\
    \ at 1600 K\n(Fig. S13†). This temperature is used to sample higher-energy\ncongurations\
    \ more eﬃciently. In all cases, only hundreds of\nground truth evaluations were\
    \ necessary to generate GAPs\naﬀording stable dynamics, with sacc values on the\
    \ order of\npicoseconds (Table 1, Fig. S14, ESI Section S1†). For a repre-\nsentative\
    \ example, the computed RDFs for acetonitrile compare\nwell with the ground truth\
    \ (Fig. S15†). As with the water models\nabove, to quantitatively evaluate bulk\
    \ properties training an\naccurate reference method and the inclusion of nuclear\n\
    quantum eﬀects would be necessary.34,36 Nevertheless, this\nexample demonstrates\
    \ that the training method is applicable to\na range of chemical systems beyond\
    \ water. In this sense, the\nstrategy presented here can be considered “transferable”\
    \ as it\ncan be directly applied to obtain ML potentials for other\nchemical systems.\
    \ This should not be confused with general ML\npotentials which are aimed to describe\
    \ diﬀerent systems.\nAqueous Zn(II)\nModelling metal ions in solution remains\

    decomposed\ninto\na [Zn(H2O)6]2+ cluster and the remaining water molecules. A\n\
    strategy identical to the one described for water was used,\ntraining the intermolecular\
    \ interactions separately with a 4.0 ˚A\nintermolecular cut-oﬀ for the oxygen\
    \ atoms. Using this poten-\ntial, MD simulations were propagated at 300 K reproducing\

    \ the rst (2.08 ˚A) and second hydration shells\nwithout further optimisation\
    \ (Fig. 3).\nThe accuracy of the local structure compared to experiment\nin the\
    \ rst and second solvation shell indicates that this parti-\ntioning is eﬀective\

    may be ‘stable’ and not sample any high energy regions for t [\nsacc. Here, the\
    \ potential for the Zn–water cluster was trained on\nalmost 1000 congurations,\
    \ suggesting that tens of atoms per\ncomponent may be the upper limit in dimensionality\
    \ for which\na model can be trained within a day.\nMetallocage dynamics\nWith\
    \ a method capable of generating high-quality potentials for\nmodestly sized chemical\
    \ systems, we next demonstrate the\napplicability of the strategy to investigate\
    \ a supramolecular\nmetallocage consisting of >100 atoms including metal ions.\
    \ As\na representative example, we selected the [Pd2L4]4+ metallocage\narchitecture\n\
    (L\n¼\norganic\npyridine-based\nligand),\nwhich\noccupies a prominent place in\
    \ supramolecular chemistry.\nPreviously, we have studied this system due to its\
    \ catalytic\nprociency in Diels–Alder reactions employing both classical\nmolecular\
    \ dynamics and DFT modelling.70 The diﬀerent exi-\nbility of two similar cage\
    \ architectures was found to be key in\nexplaining their contrasting catalytic\
    \ activity.\nTaking advantage of the symmetry in the system, a repre-\nsentative\
    \ fragment containing one full ligand and three pyri-\ndine molecules coordinated\
    \ to a Pd2+ metal ion (68 atoms) was\nused to t a GAP for the entire cage (138\
    \ atoms) in the gas phase.\nThis potential was trained in a few days (\x031400\
    \ CPUh). We used\nthe resulting GAP to perform nanosecond MD simulations on\n\
    the whole metallocage at 300 K in the gas phase. This simula-\ntion took one day\
    \ and \x03100 CPUh to complete. For comparison,\nan equivalent AIMD simulation\
    \ would take around 50 years with\nthe reference level of theory employed here.\
    \ The exibility of the\nsystem was monitored and compared to the one obtained\
    \ using\nclassical\nMD\nsimulations\nin\ndichloromethane\nsolvent.70\nCompared\
    \ to classical MD simulations, using helicity as\na measure of exibility, our\
    \ potential describes the cage as\nbeing more rigid; this suggests that the classical\
    \ potential\noverestimates the dynamic exibility (Fig. 4). This diﬀerence is\n\
    expected as the classical potential has no C–C^C–C dihedral\nbarrier, which is\
    \ presumably correctly captured in the GAP. This\nexample illustrates the general\
    \ applicability of the approach to\nincreasingly complex systems, where the training\
    \ of a simpler\nbut representative fragment is suﬃcient to capture the relevant\n\
    features of the full system.\nReaction dynamics in gas and solvent phase\nThe\
    \ high dimensionality and ensuing exibility of ML poten-\ntials make them highly\
    \ suitable to study reaction dynamics – the\nlatter usually require many costly\
    \ electronic structure calcula-\ntions to obtain atomic-level descriptions of\
    \ reaction mecha-\nnisms, solvent eﬀects or post-transition state (TS) dynamics.71,72\n\
    In the following section, we show that our data-eﬃcient strategy\nenables accurate\
    \ reactive potentials (sacc > 100 fs) with only\na few hundreds of DFT evaluations\
    \ for a set of prototypical\norganic reactions.\nGas phase bimolecular nucleophilic\
    \ substitution. The SN2\nnucleophilic substitution reaction is fundamental in\
    \ organic\nchemistry and has been extensively studied using AIMD and\nanalytically\
    \ t PES.71,73 However, even with eﬃcient approaches\nto tting PES, AIMD methods\
    \ still require tens of thousands of\nenergy evaluations.74 Here, we generated\
    \ a reactive GAP to study\nthe reaction between chloride and methyl chloride as\
    \ a proto-\ntypical case oen employed to validate QM/MM reactions and\nfor which\
    \ extensive literature exists (see ref. 75 and references\ntherein). By initialising\
    \ active learning from the transition state\n(TS), the true intrinsic reaction\
    \ coordinate is reproduced to\nwithin 1 kcal mol\x011 (Fig. S16†).\nInterestingly,\
    \ and unlike our previous attempt to generate\na DFT-quality GAP by evaluating\
    \ energies and forces on DFTB\nactive-learnt congurations, here, upliing a DFT-level\
    \ GAP\nto an accurate wavefunction-level GAP is possible. This\nmethod allows\
    \ coupled cluster-quality energy prole (Fig. 5a)\nand dynamics to be propagated\
    \ from the TS with just 55\nenergy and (numerical) force evaluations at the CCSD(T)\
    \ level\n(Fig. 5b and S16†). The resultant GAP is considerably more\naccurate\
    \ than the underlying DFT energy prole (dashed,\nFig. 5a). Active learning can\
    \ also be initialised from an\nassociation complex and the IRC learned without\

    This example demonstrates that with no a priori knowledge,\napart from the structure\
    \ of TS1, the topology of the bifurcating\nsurface can be revealed eﬃciently using\
    \ GAP dynamics. This\nstrategy is completely automated, requiring training of\

    \ substitution. The\nability to accurately describe bond-breaking/forming paths\
    \ in\nthe condensed-phase is crucial if this strategy is to be applied to\nincreasingly\
    \ complex processes, such as enzymatic reactions.\nTowards\nthis\ngoal,\nand\n\
    having\ngenerated\npotentials\nfor\ncondensed-phase molecular systems and gas-phase\
    \ reactions,\nwe decided to extend our active learning strategy to explicitly\n\
    solvated reactions; once again, using the SN2 reaction between\nchloride and methyl\
    \ chloride as a test case. SN2 reactions have\nbeen used as a test case for a\
    \ recent ML potential, but those\nstudies have been limited to the gas phase and\
    \ used thousands\nof training points.21 Literature examples of ML potentials to\n\
    study reactions in explicit solvent are limited. Recently, Parri-\nnello and co-workers\
    \ reported an NN potential to study urea\ndecomposition in water.41 Training a\
    \ model for the implicitly\nsolvated reaction proceeds in a similar way as for\
    \ the gas phase\nanalogue and aﬀords a surface close to the ground truth\n(Fig.\
    \ 7a).\nAdopting an identical strategy to the one employed for\ncondensed phase\
    \ systems, the intra- and inter-molecular PES\ndynamics can be propagated from\
    \ the TS and the eﬀect of\nexplicit solvation interrogated (Fig. 7b). This only\
    \ requires\nknowing a priori the gas-phase TS for the training to be\ncomplete\
    \ in explicit water. Interestingly, the behaviour in\nexplicit water (blue, Fig.\
    \ 7b) diﬀers from the implicit counter-\npart (red, Fig. 7b). This can be understood\
    \ considering that in\nimplicit solvent reorganisation is instantaneous, which\
    \ results\nin oscillations in the C–Cl bond characteristic of a gas phase\nreaction.\
    \ In contrast, the dynamics are more complex in explicit\nsolvent, with a slower\
    \ transition from the product channel.\nAdditionally, one of the 10 trajectories\
    \ re-crosses the barrier\naer 170 fs of simulation (Fig. S22†), where the solvent\
    \ has not\nreorganised to accommodate the anionic chloride yet, making\nthe path\
    \ to products shallower in energy.\nThe component-wise separation of the system\
    \ also leads to\nthe possibility of training to a more accurate ab initio surface\
    \ for\nthe gas phase reaction, in a similar way to QM/MM, but here\na ML(A)/ML(B)\
    \ partition is available where A and B are two\ndiﬀerent ground truth methods.33\
    \ Application of this kind of\nhierarchical ML potential tting will be the subject\
    \ of further\nwork.\nLimitations\nIn its current implementation, this method is\
    \ well suited for\nstudying systems of up to 50 atoms if training is expected\
    \ to be\ncompleted in a day, using a single node of 20 CPUs. For larger\nsystems,\
    \ the speed will depend on the complexity of the PES,\nwhere even using inexpensive\
    \ methods thousands of training\ncongurations and several iterations cycles may\
    \ be needed to\nlearn the diﬀerent atomic environments. In contrast, training\n\
    can be achieved eﬃciently for large systems with higher\nsymmetry, and eﬀectively\
    \ lower dimensional PES. This is the\ncase, for example, for the supramolecular\
    \ cage shown above,\nwhich contains 138 atoms and can be modelled appropriately\n\
    with a GAP that has been trained using a smaller system of only\n68 atoms (Fig.\
    \ 4). Furthermore, the current intra + intermolec-\nular decomposition remains\
    \ xed throughout the simulation\nmaking the water potential generated initially\
    \ incapable of\nauto-ionisation. Re-determining the connectivity (and therefore\n\
    re-assigning the “intra” components) every few steps during the\nsimulation might\
    \ help to address this limitation. However,\nprovided the model has been trained\
    \ in a region where\na chemical change has occurred, the molecular components\
    \ in\nthat region do not need to retain their connectivity. This is the\ncase,\
    \ for example, in the SN2 reaction shown in Fig. 7, where the\nconnectivity changes\
    \ between the two molecular units that\nconstitute the solute.\nFig. 7\nSolution-phase\

    Studying dynamic processes and the eﬀect of explicit solvation\non chemical reactions\
    \ demands a rapid method to develop\nbespoke force-eld models with high accuracy.\
    \ Here, we\ndemonstrated that within the Gaussian Approximation Poten-\ntial (GAP)\
    \ machine learning framework, accurate and robust\nmodels\ncan\nbe\ndeveloped\n\
    eﬃciently\nfor\ngas-phase\nand\ncondensed-phase molecular reactions. Our strategy\
    \ starts from\na small number of randomly selected points in the congura-\ntion\
    \ space, from which active learning training of intra- and\ninter-molecular components\
    \ of the energy and forces is carried\nout. The developed method is publicly available\
    \ (https://\ngithub.com/duartegroup/gap-train). We also dene a prospec-\ntive\
    \ error metric, which is found to be crucial in developing\nrobust active-learning-based\
    \ potentials, whereas correlation on\na predened test set is insuﬃcient to assess\
    \ the quality of such\na potential. We illustrated the generality of this approach\
    \ by\nmodelling bulk water, Zn(II) in aqueous solution, and chemical\nreactions\
    \ in the gas phase and explicit solvent, including post-\nTS cyclisation and SN2\
    \ reactions. The diversity of the examples\npresented here demonstrates the general\
    \ applicability of the\nstrategy and encourages applying this approach in the\
    \ model-\nling of more complex reactions in homogeneous and hetero-\ngeneous environments.\n\
    Methods\nAll Gaussian Approximation Potentials (GAPs) were trained\nusing the\
    \ GAP and QUIP codes (singularity distribution, commit\n#66c553f) and a Smooth\
    \ Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)58\nkernel with radial cut-oﬀ values dened\
    \ in gure captions all\nwith a smoothness (satom) of 0.5 ˚A; other hyperparameters\n\
    dened in Table S1.† For a single component condensed-phase\nsystem such as water,\
    \ two GAPs were tted for the intra and\nintermolecular components, respectively,\
    \ while for the solute–\nsolvent systems, such as the SN2 reaction between chloride\
    \ and\nmethyl chloride, three GAPs were tted: one for the gas-phase\nsolute,\
    \ a second for gas-phase solvent and a third one for the\nintermolecular interactions;\
    \ see Table S2,† entry 6 for details.\nAn example of the input script required\
    \ to train a bulk water\nmodel is shown in Fig. 8. In all systems the intramolecular\
    \ water\npotential was trained at the reference level on an evenly spaced\ngrid\
    \ (512 points, rOH ˛ [0.8–1.5] ˚A, rHH ˛ [1.0–2.5] ˚A). Other\nintramolecular\
    \ GAPs employed SOAP descriptors with cut-oﬀs\nshown outlined in the gure captions.\
    \ Intermolecular GAPs\nwere trained by subtracting intramolecular energies and\
    \ forces\nof all the dened components from the reference total energy.\nPotentials\
    \ for all pure condensed phase systems were trained\nand applied at or close to\
    \ their experimental liquid densities\nusing 10 solvent molecules (e.g. 10 H2O\
    \ molecules in a 343 ˚A3\ncubic box). Aqueous Zn and explicitly solvated SN2 reactions\n\
    used 20 water molecules in a cubic box with side length of 10 ˚A.\nAll les required\
    \ to reproduce the examples shown here can be\nfound\nin\nhttps://github.com/duartegroup/gap-train/tree/\n\
    master/examples/paper_examples.\nGAP-MD simulations were performed with ASE78\
    \ interfaced\nto QUIP with the quippy wrapper using the Langevin integrator\n\
    with 0.5 fs timesteps at 300 K unless otherwise specied.\nCondensed phase MD\
    \ simulations were performed with three-\ndimensional periodic boundary conditions\
    \ following mini-\nmisation and equilibration for at least 20 ps. Initial congura-\n\
    tions, CUR61 selection and all learning curves were generated\nwith the gap-train\
    \ module, which was used to run the auto-\nmated tting.79 All active learning\
    \ was performed using a ‘diﬀ’\nstrategy, where a conguration is added to the\
    \ training set if jE0\n\x01 EGAPj is larger than a threshold. With system-dependent\n\
    hyperparameter\noptimisation,\nusing\na\nthreshold\non\nthe\nmaximum atomic variance\
    \ predicted by the Gaussian process\n(‘gp_var’) can result in accelerated learning\
    \ (Fig. S25†). CUR\nselection used SOAPs averaged over atoms in a conguration\n\
    using the Dscribe80 package (‘inner’ averaging, over entries of\nthe expansion\
    \ coeﬃcient vector). Intra + inter (I + I) energy and\nforce evaluations used\
    \ an expansion factor of 10 to ensure no\nintermolecular atoms were within the\
    \ intra GAP cut-oﬀ. The\nNumPy81\nbased\nimplementation\nintroduces\na\nnegligible\n\
    computational overhead for expanding the box (\x030.1 ms per\nstep real time)\
    \ but requires two GAP calculations on the inter\nand intra components, currently\
    \ carried out in serial. All\ngenerated potentials, with the exception of the\
    \ revPBE0-D3\nwater potential and metallocage, were trained in less than\na day\
    \ on 10 CPU cores. The revPBE0-D3 water potential was\nconstructed without any\
    \ prior data in 5 days (1 intra + 4 inter)\nand used 20 CPU cores, while the metallocage\
    \ fragment was\ntrained for 3 days also on 20 CPU cores. Explicit SN2 reaction\n\
    dynamics simulations were performed using intra components\nfor H2O and [Cl/CH3Cl]\x01\
    , where the latter, due to the nite\natomic cut-oﬀ employed, has the correct\
    \ dissociation behaviour\nwhen Cl\x01 and CH3Cl are distant.\nPeriodic DFTB calculations\
    \ performed with DFTB+82 using\n3ob83 parameters, and molecular equivalents using\
    \ GFN2-XTB84\nin XTB v. 6.2.3. Periodic pure DFT calculations were performed\n\
    with GPAW85,86 v. 19.8.1 with the PBE87 functional and a 400 eV\nplane-wave cut-oﬀ\
    \ from a dzp LCAO initial guess at the gamma\npoint. Hybrid periodic DFT calculations\
    \ with the revPBE088,89\nfunctional combined with the D390 dispersion correction\
    \ were\nperformed with CP2K.91\nMolecular DFT, MP2 and coupled cluster [DLPNO-CCSD(T)]\n\
    calculations used for training were performed with ORCA92,93\nv. 4.2.1 wrapped\
    \ with autodE94 using PBE87 and PBE089 func-\ntionals, (ma)-def2-SVP, def2-TZVP\
    \ and ma-def2-TZVPP basis\nsets.95 AIMD calculations at the DFTB level were performed\

    \ \n1 INTRODUCTION \nAs video conferencing (VC) becomes a mainstay of work and\
    \ edu-\ncation, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, particular consid-\nerations\
    \ for d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) people arise. Access \nto VC is vital,\
    \ especially given the projected exponential growth \nin VC use by businesses,\
    \ teleworkers and individuals over the next \ndecade [48, 62]. However, mainstream\
    \ VC platforms were largely \ndesigned with hearing people in mind [82] and are\
    \ inaccessible \n[43, 49] to the 430 million DHH people globally [83]. These con-\n\
    cerns are particularly relevant for people who communicate in sign \nlanguage,\
    \ or signers (including DHH people and sign language \ninterpreters), who have\
    \ to navigate using a visual mode of commu-\nnication on platforms that prioritize\
    \ auditory (e.g., identifying the \nactive speaker based on sound), and textual\
    \ (e.g., chat and closed \ncaptioning) modalities and often reduce visual information\
    \ to a \nsea of thumbnails. This shift to VC happens against the backdrop \nof\
    \ a history of technology that was once exclusively used by and \ndesigned for\
    \ DHH people (e.g., text telephone relay calls) being \nreplaced by more universally\
    \ used commercial technologies [51]. \nExisting VC platforms, which are not designed\
    \ with the particular \nneeds of signers in mind, fall short [43], in part due\
    \ to technological \n(e.g., signifcant hardware capabilities for the frame rates\
    \ required \nto view sign language [18, 43]) and environmental (e.g., small video\
    \ \nthumbnails that make signing and lipreading difcult) oversights. \nWhile DHH\
    \ people use a range of communication methods, our \nfocus is on those who primarily\
    \ communicate through American \nSign Language (ASL), a group conservatively estimated\
    \ to be at \nleast 500,000 people in the United States alone [57]. When commu-\n\
    nicating with the ‘mainstream’ hearing community, Deaf1 signers \ncommonly utilize\
    \ sign language interpreters, given that written \nEnglish or captioning does\
    \ not provide the same access, functional \nequivalency, or expressive power for\
    \ signers [43]. ASL is an indepen-\ndent visual-spatial language that shares no\
    \ grammatical similarities \nto English [67], and written English can be inaccessible\
    \ to signers \nas their English literacy may be relatively lower than their hearing\
    \ \npeers [52, 54, 64]. While the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) \nrequires\
    \ that employers and event hosts provide accessibility ser-\nvices to ensure “efective\
    \ communication” with DHH people [84], \neven providing visual access to sign\
    \ language interpreters during \nvideo conferences does not ensure full access.\
    \ ‘Efective communi-\ncation’ must include the ability to participate, communicate,\
    \ and \ncollaborate with both signers and non-signers, which mainstream \nvideoconferencing\
    \ does not currently guarantee [43]. \n1The uppercase D represents the group of\
    \ Deaf people with a shared language and \ncultural identity \nCHI ’22, April\
    \ 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nJazz Ang et al. \nDespite DHH people’s\
    \ diverse video communication needs, most \nprior work [16, 38, 42] does not specifcally\
    \ target signers, de-\nspite the fact that the key elements of ASL (handshape,\
    \ move-\nment, sign location, orientation and non-manual behaviors) gener-\nate\
    \ unique requirements for inclusive interaction experience design \n[15, 25, 43,\
    \ 49]. While prior HCI and CSCW studies have explored \nvideo communication in\
    \ ASL, much has focused on automated ASL \nrecognition [13, 40, 73], animation\
    \ [1, 33, 35], and classroom use \n[16, 41], with a very limited understanding\
    \ of real-time computer-\nmediated ASL communication through interpreters [17,\
    \ 49]. Addi-\ntionally, while some work has explored the experiences of inter-\n\
    preters who work for Video Relay Service (VRS) or Video Remote \nInterpreting\
    \ (VRI2) providers [60, 71], less is known about freelance \ncommunity ASL interpreters’\
    \ use of VC, who traditionally work \nin person and do not have formal remote\
    \ interpreting support. In \nresponse to the exponential increase in use of desktop-based\
    \ VC \nplatforms during the COVID pandemic, we focus on specifc consid-\nerations\
    \ that signers face in this unique context, providing the frst \nqualitative accounts\
    \ of both d/Deaf3 signers and ASL community \ninterpreters’ use of and design\
    \ preferences for videoconferencing. \nTo address these gaps in literature, we\
    \ conducted interviews \nand co-design sessions with 16 participants: eight d/Deaf\
    \ signers \nand eight ASL community interpreters. All the research activities\
    \ \nwere designed to be conducted through the same VC platforms \nthat we aim\
    \ to improve. Prior accessibility research [8, 34, 55] has \nhighlighted how existing\
    \ remote research methods, that were de-\nsigned for the hearing community, do\
    \ not fully account for d/Deaf \nsigners’ needs. This provided the impetus for\
    \ us, a Deaf-hearing \nmixed-ability research team, to frst examine and design\
    \ an inclu-\nsive remote research protocol that is culturally appropriate and\
    \ \naccessible to d/Deaf signers. Using the accessible research process \nthat\
    \ we designed, we conducted 12 formative interviews, six with \nd/Deaf signers\
    \ and six with interpreters, which then informed four \nco-design sessions, two\
    \ with d/Deaf signers and two with inter-\npreters. Our research was guided by\
    \ the following questions: \n• RQ1: What access barriers do signers face in consuming\
    \ \ninformation, communicating and collaborating on VCs? \n• RQ2: What design\
    \ opportunities exist for VC platforms to \nfacilitate a signer-inclusive communication\
    \ environment? \nOur fndings center on the accessibility barriers that signers\
    \ face \nwhen they consume information (e.g., having visual clarity of signs),\
    \ \ncommunicate (e.g., getting attention of others), and collaborate (e.g., \n\
    working with team interpreters) on VC. Notably, the limited screen \nestate and\
    \ afordances of VC platforms create challenges around \nidentifying active signers,\
    \ comprehending sign language, getting \nattention, and interjecting into ongoing\
    \ conversation. Additionally, \ninterpreters, who often work in teams, found that\
    \ they could not \nefectively collaborate on VC platforms, leaving them to develop\
    \ \nworkarounds with varying degrees of success. Further, we provide \na deeper\
    \ understanding of the requirements for hosting accessible \nvideoconferences\
    \ and guidelines for conducting remote research \nwith d/Deaf signers. \n2Video\
    \ Relay Service (VRS) or Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) are two mainstream \n\
    telecommunication services which have allowed DHH signers to use remote inter-\n\
    preters to communicate with hearing people since the mid-1990s\n3Although some\
    \ hard of hearing people communicate in ASL, our fndings are scoped \nto d/Deaf\
    \ people as all of our participants identifed as either deaf or Deaf. \nOur work\
    \ contributes 1) an empirical account of VC use that high-\nlights the perspectives\
    \ of both d/Deaf signers and interpreters, and \n2) user-elicited practical design\
    \ recommendations for new and ex-\nisting commercially available VC platforms.\
    \ In addition, the authors \nalso present practical guidelines for working with\
    \ d/Deaf signers \nin qualitative studies and design activities for future research.\
    \ \n2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK \nWe frst provide important background context\
    \ about sign language \nand then discuss prior work in groupware and video conferencing\
    \ \naccessibility, particularly for signers and interpreters. \n2.1 Deaf Culture\
    \ & Sign Language \nThroughout most of the United States and Canada, American\
    \ Sign \nLanguage (ASL) is the Deaf community’s primary language. As \nan independent\
    \ visual-spatial language, ASL has its own distinct \ngrammatical rules and consists\
    \ of a sequence of handshapes, lo-\ncations, palm orientation, and non-manual\
    \ markers (NMM) and \nmovements [24, 49, 74, 77]. NMMs include visual-facial gestural\
    \ \nexpressions, head tilting, eye shifting and body positioning, and \nprovide\
    \ critical additional grammatical context to manual signs in \nASL conversation.\
    \ A common example of NMM use is furrowing \none’s eyebrows and doing a slight\
    \ backwards head tilt to indicate \nthat signed WH- words (e.g., who, what, when,\
    \ where, why) are \nbeing used to ask a question [80, 85]. Additionally, signers\
    \ rely \non solely non-verbal backchannel feedback, a linguistic phenome-\nnon\
    \ wherein people signal their understanding, active attention, \nand dis/agreement\
    \ to speakers without taking the communicative \nfoor [30, 63, 77]. Spoken languages\
    \ use both non-verbal (e.g., low-\nered eyebrows to indicate confusion) and verbal\
    \ (e.g., “mmhmm”, \n“yeah”) backchannelling, and hearing communicators can multitask,\
    \ \nattending to the spoken content of a conversation alongside visual \nand non-visual\
    \ backchannel feedback. Deaf signers, on the other \nhand, can only attend to\
    \ communication in their line of sight and \ntherefore require particular conversational\
    \ environments to be able \nto follow both a conversation and backchannel feedback.\
    \ Further, \nthe use of eye gaze is critical in ASL as it is a key element of\
    \ many \ngrammatical structures such as verb agreement [76]. ASL commu-\nnication\
    \ relies on many parts of the body, including handshapes, \nfacial expressions,\
    \ and body movements, and rendering this rich \nvisual information online creates\
    \ unique considerations. \nWhile the hearing world often considers deafness to\
    \ be a type of \ndisability, many Deaf people instead see deafness as a cultural\
    \ iden-\ntity, akin to an ethnicity [34, 45]. ASL is central to Deaf culture and\
    \ \nidentity, operating not just as a preferred communication modality \nbut as\
    \ a site of community formation [45]. Deaf studies scholar \nTom Humphries coined\
    \ the term “audism” to describe the systemic \ndiscrimination where “one is superior\
    \ based on one’s ability to hear \nor behave in the manner of one who hears” [8,\
    \ 45, 74]. While many \nDHH signers fall back on texting or captioning to communicate\
    \ \nwith others, prior work argues that an overemphasis on text-based \nmodalities\
    \ in technology development perpetuates audist biases \nthat push DHH signers\
    \ to conform with spoken and written Eng-\nlish rather than respecting their preference\
    \ for sign [8, 49]. This \nmanifestation of audism can place the burden on DHH\
    \ users to \n“In this online environment, we’re limited” \nCHI ’22, April 29–May\
    \ 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \n“cross the bridge” and accommodate to the hearing\
    \ world’s way of \ncommunication [8, 44, 45]. \nAvoiding audist practices and\
    \ cultural appropriation in research \nrequires focusing not only on technological\
    \ artifacts but also on \nparticipants’ social, cultural, and historical contexts\
    \ [34]. This sen-\nsitivity is necessary in all stages of research, including\
    \ method and \nprotocol design as many common HCI methods can exclude DHH \nparticipants,\
    \ such as ‘think aloud’ protocols which require partici-\npants to explain their\
    \ thoughts while completing an activity and \nare not well-suited to signed communication\
    \ [8, 34, 55]. Prior work \nhas explored accessible methods such as translating\
    \ existing ques-\ntionnaires to ASL [10, 12, 32], conducting culturally-aware\
    \ research \n[26, 34, 66] and utilizing ASL questionnaires to collect data [11,\
    \ 36]. \nOur research practices bring careful consideration of Deaf cultural \n\
    context to interview and design methods, heeding Bauman’s call \nto avoid “enforcing\
    \ a normalcy that privileges speech over sign and \nhearing over deafness” [8].\
    \ \n2.2 Sign Language Interpreting \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic increased DHH signers’\
    \ need for \ndesktop-based VC platforms (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet, Skype) in \n\
    many aspects of daily life, many community ASL interpreters’ work \nshifted to\
    \ unfamiliar remote interpreting environments. There is a \nlack of existing research\
    \ around VC use by community interpreters \nand little consideration of the demands\
    \ on virtual interpreting teams. \nParticularly for jobs that last longer than\
    \ an hour, sign language in-\nterpreters often work in teams of two or three,\
    \ switching who is the \nactive interpreter in set time intervals (e.g., every\
    \ 20 minutes) [59]. \nWhile the active (“on”) interpreter is interpreting for\
    \ the client, the \ninactive (“of”) interpreter(s) assists the “on” interpreter\
    \ whenever \nneeded [9]. For example, the inactive interpreter might sign a spe-\n\
    cifc term quickly to the active interpreter if the active interpreter \nmissed\
    \ the term due to a noisy environment. Public posts from \ncommunity ASL interpreters\
    \ indicate that while working online, \nthe ability to get support from team interpreters\
    \ is “greatly reduced” \n[19]. \nSign-language-mediated communication between\
    \ DHH signers \nand hearing people and the role technology plays in these interac-\n\
    tions is a relatively underexplored area of HCI research. A notewor-\nthy exception\
    \ from Napier and Leneham [58] found that diferent \nafordances (e.g., visual\
    \ distractions, rendering signs in 2D) and \nfactors (e.g., logistical set up)\
    \ of VC afected the efcacy of remote \nVRI interpreting in legal contexts. However,\
    \ while prior work has \nexamined professional services such as VRS and VRI [60,\
    \ 71], the \ndiferent social and technological barriers community interpreters\
    \ \nusing commercial VC platforms face have not yet been studied. \nBy focusing\
    \ on commercially available VC platforms for freelance \ninterpreters specifcally,\
    \ our work ofers new insights into how VC \ncan help facilitate interpreter-mediated\
    \ communication. \n2.3 Accessibility for Signers in Video \nConferencing Platforms\
    \ \nAn emerging but relatively underexplored area of HCI and CSCW \nresearch involves\
    \ analyzing how people with diverse abilities con-\nsume information, communicate,\
    \ and collaborate over shared in-\nterfaces or groupware. Prior work has studied\
    \ the communication \nbarriers on mobile for signers [43, 49, 68], with limited\
    \ focus on \ndesktop-based VC platforms which are used for diferent tasks (e.g.,\
    \ \nscreen sharing, discussion facilitation) than mobile applications. \nWhile\
    \ McDonnell et al. [53] report on DHH people’s use of cap-\ntions during videoconferences,\
    \ our work focuses on d/Deaf signers \nspecifcally and flls the literature gap\
    \ on accessible design of exist-\ning, commonly used groupware (video conferencing\
    \ platforms in \nparticular). The study takes up the call to reframe assistive\
    \ technol-\nogy as a form of groupware instead of as a tool for a single, Deaf\
    \ or \ndisabled individual, as articulated by Wang & Piper and McDonnell \net\
    \ al. [53, 79]. Instead of introducing a new tool to bridge accessi-\nbility gaps,\
    \ we argue that accessibility should be a priority instead \nof an afterthought\
    \ in the design of everyday applications. \n2.3.1 Existing Assistive Technology\
    \ for Signers. Existing solutions \nfor DHH signers tend to center on automating\
    \ sign language inter-\npretation, rather than promoting equitable participation\
    \ for signers. \nThere is an emerging interest from researchers to digitally me-\n\
    diate sign language communication through real-time machine \nlearning recognition\
    \ of signs [13, 14, 40, 73]. Existing works often \nexplore generating ASL signs\
    \ through animations and virtual hu-\nman avatars [1, 33, 35, 37] but many have\
    \ not addressed accurate \nfacial and non-manual expression synthesis [14, 27,\
    \ 37]. Though \nprogress has been made, critical sign language recognition and\
    \ gen-\neration problems remain, hindering real-world applications [14]. \nGugenheimer\
    \ et al. [27] further argue that technology focused on \nspoken language/sign\
    \ language translation may see low adoption \nrates because it does not account\
    \ for Deaf social and cultural norms \nand forces adoption of hearing society’s\
    \ dominant (spoken) lan-\nguage. We seek to fll a gap in literature by assessing\
    \ AT solutions \nwithin the context of d/Deaf community norms. \n2.3.2 Existing\
    \ Accessibility Features for Video Conferencing. Re-\nsearch on the accessibility\
    \ of VC increased with the onset of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, (e.g., [53, 69, 75]),\
    \ fnding that online envi-\nronments generate diferent access considerations than\
    \ in-person \ncommunication. Two notable studies document the experiences of \n\
    DHH researchers communicating on VC platforms and outline lim-\nitations that\
    \ make video conferencing inaccessible for DHH users \n[43, 78]. Kushalnagar and\
    \ Vogler [43] found that DHH users face \nmyriad challenges (e.g., reduced frame\
    \ rates, difculty reading lips \nor signs etc.) when the meetings become too large\
    \ relative to each \nindividual’s hardware capabilities and screen size, and that\
    \ plat-\nforms’ strategy of identifying active speakers based on audio does \n\
    not serve signers. Vogler et al. [78] found that online interpreting \nbetween\
    \ ASL and English created considerable lag that discouraged \nDHH people’s participation\
    \ and highlighted overall challenges with \nVC solutions (e.g., unstable video\
    \ jitters, insufcient frame rates \nrequired to understand sign language etc.)\
    \ that remain unaddressed \nfor DHH users. Additionally, the design of accessibility\
    \ features on \nVC platforms makes it so that there is signifcant pressure and\
    \ bur-\nden on meeting hosts to make meetings accessible [82]. We aim to \nadd\
    \ to this new body of research, contributing both d/Deaf signers \nand community\
    \ interpreters’ perspectives on the in/accessibility of \nvideo conferencing and\
    \ their preferences for future design. \n2.3.3 Accessible Video Conferencing Design.\
    \ To improve video con-\nferencing design, prior HCI work has focused on improving\
    \ visual \nCHI ’22, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nJazz Ang et\
    \ al. \naccess to sign language interpreters and reducing visual disper-\nsion.\
    \ This is motivated by the fact that, when having to contend \nwith several simultaneous\
    \ visual sources (e.g., interpreters, cap-\ntions, class slides, speaker’s body\
    \ language), DHH signers often \nmiss critical information [16, 21, 46, 52, 56].\
    \ Previous research has \nexplored several display confgurations to relieve this\
    \ visual burden. \nFor example, Kushalnagar et al. [21] explored the concept of\
    \ closed \ninterpreting, allowing users to confgure the interpreter’s video feed\
    \ \nto their preference on pre-recorded lecture videos. The study found \nthat\
    \ moving and resizing the interpreter’s screen over the video \nincreases the\
    \ signer’s ease of viewing, satisfaction and comprehen-\nsion. Cavender et al.\
    \ [16] enabled DHH students to consolidate \nvarious sources of information (e.g.,\
    \ slides, instructors, interpreters) \nin a customizable VC layout, and found\
    \ that it increased perfor-\nmance. Miller et al., [56] allowed a user to overlay\
    \ a translucent \nvideo (of their interpreter or another collaborator) over a\
    \ shared \nworkspace (such as a spreadsheet), fnding limitations around how \n\
    overlapping videos covered non-manual visual cues signifcant in \nASL [56]. While\
    \ these interventions explore bespoke video-based \nASL access, we instead explore\
    \ the design of commercial, widely \nused VC platforms. \n3 METHODS \nOur research\
    \ has three phases: accessible remote study protocol \ndesign, formative interviews,\
    \ and co-design workshops. Our study \ndesign actively involved d/Deaf signers\
    \ (including one of the co-\nfrst authors) in the research process to ensure the\
    \ protocol met \ntheir needs. All three phases were conducted remotely through\
    \ \nvideoconferencing — the same medium that our research aims to \nimprove. Therefore,\
    \ we had to frst develop an accessible protocol \nfor d/Deaf participants. \n\
    3.1 Remote Study Protocol Design \nWe iteratively designed our protocol based\
    \ on six pilot sessions \nwith 10 pilot participants. Content from the pilot sessions\
    \ is not \nincluded in our fndings. Beginning with the pilot studies, and con-\n\
    tinuing throughout the entire research process, we adopted a critical \nrefective\
    \ perspective [20, 23, 70] by journaling and conducting ret-\nrospective discussions\
    \ to document and resolve the accessibility \nissues that signers and researchers\
    \ faced. To ensure consistency and \nfamiliarity with the nuances of the research,\
    \ two ASL interpreters, \ncertifed by Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc.\
    \ (RID), were \nhired as the designated interpreters to interpret for all sessions\
    \ \n(including the pilots), hereafter referred to as research interpreters. \n\
    Both research interpreters are highly qualifed, and had an estab-\nlished working\
    \ relationship with the Deaf co-frst author. One has \nbeen interpreting for over\
    \ 30 years and the other is both an experi-\nenced researcher and interpreter.\
    \ \nOur initial three pilot studies (two interviews, one co-design ses-\nsion\
    \ with three signers) provided a preliminary understanding of \naccess issues\
    \ within our protocols. During each session, researchers \ncreated feld notes\
    \ of their observations and participants’ feedback, \nand sessions were followed\
    \ by a 30-minute refective debrief with \nthe research team (one Deaf researcher\
    \ who primarily communi-\ncates in ASL, one hearing researcher, and two research\
    \ interpreters). \nThese debriefs guided protocol iteration based on challenges\
    \ during \nthe pilots (e.g., having a researcher sketch participant ideas rather\
    \ \nthan having participants juggle between signing and using Figma). \nTo validate\
    \ and fne-tune our updated protocols we conducted \nthree more pilot studies (two\
    \ interviews, with a d/Deaf signer and \ninterpreter, and one codesign session\
    \ with three DHH signers), \ncontinuing to debrief and iterate until we felt confdent\
    \ that our \nprotocol would allow the most accessible study we could conduct \n\
    given the environmental constraints of remote research. We fur-\nther detail protocol\
    \ iterations in following subsections (Formative \nInterviews, and Co-design Workshops).\
    \ \n3.2 Participants \nParticipants were recruited via email lists, snowball sampling,\
    \ and \nsocial media posts. All recruitment materials and consent forms \nwere\
    \ provided in both English and ASL. Our study involved two \ngroups of participants:\
    \ sighted d/Deaf signers, who primarily com-\nmunicate in ASL, and freelance ASL\
    \ interpreters, who initially \nprovided in-person interpretation service for\
    \ the community and \nswitched to remote interpreting due to the pandemic, hereafter\
    \ \nreferred to as interpreter participants. All interpreter participants \nidentifed\
    \ as hearing. We required that participants be 18 years or \nolder, able to join\
    \ a Zoom call, and located in the United States or \nCanada. We recruited eight\
    \ d/Deaf signers4 (four men, four women \n- see Table 1) and eight ASL interpreter\
    \ participants (two men, four \nwomen, two undisclosed - see Table 2), selected\
    \ out of 58 screener \nrespondents (43 d/Deaf people and 15 ASL interpreters)\
    \ to optimize \nfor a more representative sample across their age group, gender,\
    \ \nand video conferencing frequency. \n3.3 Formative Interviews \nWe conducted\
    \ 12 semi-structured interviews with six d/Deaf sign-\ners and six ASL interpreter\
    \ participants. Each 60-minute interview \nwas conducted by a Deaf researcher\
    \ who primarily communicates \nin ASL and a hearing researcher who knows basic\
    \ ASL. Interviews \nwith signers were conducted in ASL and interpreted to English\
    \ by \ntwo research interpreters for the hearing researcher and for tran-\nscription\
    \ purposes, while interviews with interpreter participants \nwere conducted either\
    \ in ASL or spoken English based on each par-\nticipant’s preference. The protocol\
    \ design process (3.1) highlighted \nseveral technological considerations in running\
    \ an accessible re-\nmote interview with signers. To mitigate these pitfalls,\
    \ we made \nthe following adjustments to standard interview processes: \n• Modifed\
    \ Deaf researcher’s physical environment for virtual \nfacilitation. Facilitating\
    \ an interview on a single screen intro-\nduced multiple accessibility issues\
    \ for the Deaf researcher \n(e.g., the researcher needed to sit at a distance\
    \ from her cam-\nera to ensure her signing was in frame, which made inter-\npreter’s\
    \ video feeds too small to be comprehensible). Hence, \nthe Deaf researcher modifed\
    \ her workstation to include an \nadditional monitor (for interview questions),\
    \ a tablet, (to ac-\ncess research interpreters) and a laptop (to view participants\
    \ \nand maintain adequate eye contact) (See Supplementary Ma-\nterials for more\
    \ details). \n4All our signer participants identifed as either deaf or Deaf, which\
    \ we herein referred \nto as d/Deaf signers. \n“In this online environment, we’re\

    \ ‘I’ - Interview and ‘C’ - Co-design Workshop \n• Specifc technological requirement\
    \ for participants. We dis-\ncovered during the pilot that Zoom’s browser application\
    \ \ndid not include features necessary for d/Deaf signers’ access \n(e.g., only\
    \ able to see four video feeds during screen sharing). \nTo avoid potential technical\
    \ issues from using the browser \nversion of Zoom, we required that all participants\
    \ download \nand use Zoom’s desktop application version, not the browser \nversion,\
    \ for the study. \nOur interviews sought to understand how participants used \n\
    VC with non-signers, signers, and interpreters. We organized our \ninterview protocol\
    \ around three key aspects of VC-mediated in-\nteraction: consuming information\
    \ (i.e., taking in content), com-\nmunication (i.e., expressing ideas), and collaboration\
    \ (i.e., doing \nshared tasks). The content of the interview focused on accessibility\
    \ \nchallenges while videoconferencing, VC platform usability issues, \nworkarounds\
    \ participants have developed, and refections on sign-\ning remotely. Protocols\
    \ difered for d/Deaf signers and freelance \ninterpreter participants to capture\
    \ their specifc experiences. At \nthe end of each session, interested participants\
    \ were invited to the \nco-design workshops. \nAfter completing interviews, we\
    \ analyzed the transcripts and \nidentifed eight key accessibility barriers that\
    \ signers and inter-\npreters faced (e.g., difculty getting signers’ attention),\
    \ which we \nused as a starting point for co-design discussions and tasks (see\
    \ \nanalysis details in Section 3.5). See Supplementary Materials for \na list\
    \ of these barriers, which groups they were presented to, and \nhow they were\
    \ explained to participants. \n3.4 Co-Design Workshops \nWe conducted four co-design\
    \ workshops with 12 participants to \nexplore design solutions based on the themes\
    \ from our formative \ninterviews. Sessions were limited to three participants\
    \ each to ac-\ncount for the difculty in videoconferencing with larger groups,\
    \ \nand we conducted two sessions with groups of d/Deaf signers and \ntwo sessions\
    \ with groups of ASL interpreter participants. We sepa-\nrated participant groups\
    \ to capture the nuanced diferences in each \nCHI ’22, April 29–May 05, 2022,\
    \ New Orleans, LA, USA \nJazz Ang et al. \ngroup’s experiences and technology\
    \ needs and to ensure that hear-\ning interpreters’ needs did not get prioritized\
    \ over d/Deaf signers. \nDuring our pilot process, we identifed several accessibility\
    \ is-\nsues around conducting co-design sessions over VC and ultimately \nimplemented\
    \ the following adaptations: \n• Establish communication rules. With varied signing\
    \ styles \nand accents, research interpreters often require brief pauses \nfor\
    \ clarifcation. Furthermore, while multiple signers can \nefectively communicate\
    \ at the same time, that is difcult \nto interpret into spoken English. To mitigate\
    \ this, we asked \nparticipants to take turns and ensure that only one signer\
    \ \nhas the foor at a time, which is not always necessary when \nsigning in person\
    \ or without interpretation. \n• 1:1 ratio of d/Deaf participants and research\
    \ interpreters. Dur-\ning the pilot, it was visually and cognitively overwhelming\
    \ \nfor two research interpreters to interpret for four signers \n(three d/Deaf\
    \ participants and one Deaf researcher) simul-\ntaneously. Given that this can\
    \ lead to research interpreters \nmissing some participant’s signs, we introduced\
    \ a third re-\nsearch interpreter5 for each workshop to make interpretation \n\
    more manageable. \n6\n• Interpreter participants to voice , rather than sign.\
    \ We found \nthat being able to hear how their signing was being inter-\npreted\
    \ could be distracting for hearing ASL interpreter par-\nticipants, as the word\
    \ choice used, emotive language or in-\nterpretation sometimes difered from what\
    \ they intended. \nTo address this, we asked interpreter participants to voice,\
    \ \nand the research interpreters primarily interpreted spoken \nEnglish into\
    \ ASL for the Deaf researcher. \n• Design assistant acts as the ‘hands’ of participant-led\
    \ discus-\nsions. While co-design activities often ask participants to \n‘think-aloud’\
    \ and sketch, signing and sketching simultane-\nously is inaccessible for d/Deaf\
    \ signers. Sketching requires \none’s visual attention on the sketch and at least\
    \ one hand to \nact on a design, which limits both expressive and receptive \n\
    capacity for signers. The most accessible method we found \nwas having a hearing\
    \ researcher act as a design assistant, \ndigitally sketching on a tablet in real-time\
    \ while participants \ndescribed their ideas. These sketches were screenshared\
    \ and \nthe design assistant continuously revised them according to \nparticipants’\
    \ instructions. Participants were also encouraged \nto engage in any other ways\
    \ they preferred (e.g., annotation \ntools, paper sketches etc.). \nEach co-design\
    \ session lasted 90 minutes, beginning with brief \ndiscussion on two themes from\
    \ the formative interviews. To capture \na breadth of ideas, each session participants\
    \ engaged with diferent \nthemes around accessibility barriers that signers or\
    \ interpreters \nface, covering all eight key accessibility barriers we identifed\
    \ in \nour interviews over the course of the four co-design sessions. After \n\
    open-ended refection and discussion about the issues presented, \nparticipants\
    \ collectively ideated on possible solutions to address \neach theme, guiding\
    \ the creation of the screenshared sketches. We \n5The third research interpreter,\
    \ who possessed a lot of experience interpreting across \nvarious settings and\
    \ is also certifed by Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc. (RID), \nwas\
    \ engaged to interpret for the co-design workshops only.\n6The terms “voice” or\
    \ “voicing” are used as complements to “sign” or “signing” to \nindicate communication\
    \ using spoken language. \nprompted participants to discuss their design rationale\
    \ throughout, \nand the session ended with a refective discussion of shared ideas\
    \ \nand priorities. \n3.5 Analysis \nThe interpreted, spoken English from all\
    \ interviews and co-design \nsessions was professionally transcribed. We conducted\
    \ inductive, \nsemantic, and realist refexive thematic analysis [15, 16] on both\
    \ \nthe interview and co-design workshop transcripts. First, the two \nco-frst\
    \ authors familiarized themselves with all 12 interview tran-\nscripts, referring\
    \ back to the video recordings for clarifcations \nwhen needed. They then coded\
    \ the interview transcripts and col-\nlaboratively developed an initial set of\
    \ codes. This set of codes \nwas iteratively clustered into broad themes, diferentiating\
    \ the data \ncollected from d/Deaf participants and interpreter participants to\
    \ \nidentify themes that are unique to either group. After accounting for \noverlaps\
    \ and mapping the relationships within the initial themes, \nwe had a set of eight\
    \ themes around key accessibility barriers our \nparticipants faced, which were\
    \ used as a starting point for our \nco-design discussion and tasks. \nFollowing\
    \ the co-design workshops, we repeated the aforemen-\ntioned analysis process\
    \ on the set of four session transcripts. After \ndeveloping an initial set of\
    \ codes (separate from the interview \ncodebook), the two co-frst authors iteratively\
    \ clustered the codes \nderived from the co-design transcripts into frst-level\
    \ themes. The \ndata collected from d/Deaf participants and interpreter participants\
    \ \nwere also carefully diferentiated to identify themes that are unique \nto\
    \ either group. Then these frst-level semantic themes from the \nco-design workshops\
    \ were considered alongside codes from the \ninitially analyzed interview data\
    \ to identify and further synthesize \ncross-cutting, second-level themes. The\
    \ themes at this stage, which \nconcerned both specifc accessibility barriers\
    \ and design implica-\ntions, were refned by iteratively mapping thematic relationships\
    \ \nwithin the dataset. \nTo further validate the second-level themes, we used\
    \ visual anal-\nysis methods [47, 65] on observational video data and participant-\n\
    elicited design artifacts gathered during the co-design workshops. \nThis process\
    \ allowed the research team to deepen analysis around \nhow signers and interpreters\
    \ interact during remote work and to \nfurther refne themes deductively. To generate\
    \ observational data \non micro-interactions between d/Deaf signers, research\
    \ interpreters, \nand researchers, the co-frst authors and research interpreters\
    \ ana-\nlyzed workshop video recordings [6, 65]. As a group, they reviewed \n\
    the workshops in 10–15-minute segments, taking independent ob-\nservational notes\
    \ while viewing a segment and then discussing \nnotable interactions before continuing\
    \ on to the next segment. \nWe invited the two primary research interpreters to\
    \ participate \nin this process to include their frst-hand retrospective refections\
    \ \naround what motivated certain interpretation decisions and their \nperspectives\
    \ on the data in our analysis, providing unique insights \naround signer-interpreter\
    \ interactions. After reaching shared un-\nderstanding around interactions, the\
    \ researchers coded the set of \nobservational data, sorting them into existing\
    \ second level themes \nor generating new themes. At this point, themes were further\
    \ re-\nfned, removing themes without sufcient evidence and merging \noverlapping\
    \ themes. Finally, the researchers used artifact analysis \n“In this online environment,\
    \ we’re limited” \nCHI ’22, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \n[65]\
    \ on the co-design sketches to identify patterns and diferences \nacross ideas.\
    \ These patterns revealed participants’ design priorities \nand were clustered\
    \ into their key purposes (e.g., identifying the \nspeaker efciently). Similarly\
    \ to the observational data, the clusters \nfrom artifact analysis were sorted\
    \ into existing themes. At this point \nthemes were fnalized, and we defned the\
    \ key insights captured in \neach. \n4 FINDINGS \nOur analysis identifed accessibility\
    \ barriers in VC use for signers \nand interpreters related to: (1) consuming\
    \ information, (2) communi-\ncating, (3) collaborating, and (4) hosting meetings\
    \ over VC platforms. \nInformed by the qualitative accounts and co-design sessions,\
    \ we also \nhighlight specifc design opportunities to make commercially used \n\
    VC platforms more accessible for signers. We occasionally name \nspecifc platforms\
    \ mentioned by participants, but none of these \nmentions constitute an endorsement.\
    \ We have also consolidated \nour design considerations into a list of signer-inclusive\
    \ VC design \nrequirements, tailored for platform designers, which is available\
    \ in \nour Supplementary Materials. \n4.1 Consuming Information \nFirst, we highlight\
    \ the challenges that signers faced when con-\nsuming information in VCs. We defne\
    \ consuming information as \npassive, non-participative and one-way information\
    \ consumption, \nsuch as attending webinars and reading slides. \n4.1.1 Locating\
    \ Signers and Interpreters. Difculty locating sign-\ners. Both d/Deaf signers\
    \ and ASL interpreters prioritized having \nthe video feeds of all signers within\
    \ their line of sight. However, ex-\nisting platforms typically automatically\
    \ resize, shrink and distribute \nvideo thumbnails over multiple pages, posing\
    \ challenges for visual \ncommunication: “when there are more people in the room\
    \ we can’t \nall ft in one screen and so you have to swipe screens to get the\
    \ view \nof the other people and that is a signifcant problem” (D17). When \n\
    the active signer/speaker’s video is not on the frst page, D3 shared, \n“I’m not\
    \ sure who’s signing, I’m not sure who’s talking”. d/Deaf sign-\ners explained\
    \ that screen sharing exacerbates this problem. When \nsigners are trying to identify\
    \ attendees who are asking questions, \nonly seeing a handful of videos on top\
    \ of the screen poses difculty \n- D4 explained “[I don’t] know if they’ve raised\
    \ their hand or where \nthey are. Sometimes I can’t see them [and] it’ll be like,\
    \ oh, they’re on \na diferent screen.” \nInformation gaps. Participants further\
    \ highlighted how the \ndelay in locating signers or interpreters made their interpreter-\n\
    mediated conversation less accessible. TERP108 found herself “miss-\ning information”\
    \ that should have been interpreted for/to the signer. \nMany d/Deaf signers like\
    \ D2 rely heavily on a clear view of their \ninterpreters to communicate, but\
    \ often must “scroll through a whole \ngallery page of postage stamp sized cameras\
    \ to fnd [interpreters]”, \nto then manually prioritize interpreter’s thumbnails\
    \ using features \nsuch as the ‘pin’ option on Zoom. This can be particularly\
    \ chal-\nlenging when team interpreters switch - delays in locating the ‘on’ \n\
    interpreter often result in information gaps. When team interpreters \n7Identifer\
    \ ‘D’ is used to refer to participants who identify as deaf or Deaf (d/Deaf) \n\
    8Identifer ‘TERP’ is used to refer to participants who are ASL interpreters \n\
    turn take and switch, D5 explained that, “[interpreters] usually will \nsign some\
    \ signal to let me know that I need to look from one inter-\npreter to the next.”\
    \ However, even with a preemptive notifcation, \nD2 described how she has to juggle\
    \ locating the other interpreter’s \nthumbnail and navigating the switch; “I have\
    \ to kind of be quick on \nthat because I don’t want to miss any of the information”.\
    \ \nWorkaround attempts. Though some participants (6 of 12 par-\nticipants) found\
    \ workarounds to minimize information gaps useful, \nothers described some of\
    \ these workarounds, such as multi-pinning \n“the interpreter and the instructor\
    \ at the same time” (D3) as tempo-\nrary band-aids. For example, in the classes\
    \ TERP13 interprets for, \nscreen sharing “cancels out those two (pinned) videos\
    \ and then just \nmakes your whole screen full screen of whatever they’re showing”.\
    \ D2 \ncommented that signers and their interpreters still require some \nadjustment\
    \ time to “do that little dance” and reconfgure the pins \nagain. Like many participants,\
    \ D1 uses multiple monitors to move \n“back and forth” between interpreters’ videos\
    \ on one side and other \ncontent (e.g., meeting notes) on another. In his coding\
    \ classes, D1 \nfeels behind because when his teacher “does some coding, [he has]\
    \ \nto look at [his] interpreter, so [he] miss[es] it”. Participants, like D4,\
    \ \noften like to “look at the person who’s making a comment or asking \na question,\
    \ [their] body language, facial expressions, and those sorts \nof things” to understand\
    \ communication context and to take in the \nvarious NMMs9 that are critical to\
    \ ASL conversations. However, D4 \nexplained that online visual dispersion forces\
    \ her to make tradeofs: \n“When I look at that person, then I miss the next part\
    \ of the interpreted \nmessage because I’m not looking at the interpreter at that\
    \ moment.” \nThe workarounds described by participants interfered with their \n\
    ability to have efective signed conversations over VCs, as they \ncontinued to\
    \ miss out on signs and NMMs.. \n4.1.2 Comprehending Signs and Visual Cues. Lack\
    \ visual clarity \nof signs. Our participants outlined how the size and fdelity\
    \ of \nvideos impacted their ability to comprehend linguistic information \n(such\
    \ as hand shape, placement, movements etc.) conveyed in ASL. \nUsers become “tiny\
    \ little thumbnail video feeds” as the number \nof attendees increases and TERP8\
    \ further commented that, “I’m \nhaving to get this close to the camera, this\
    \ close to the monitor, to \nmake sense of what they’re saying”. Participants\
    \ described similar \nchallenges across diferent VC platforms, explaining that\
    \ Microsoft \nTeams’ display of videos as “little tiny blocks at the bottom [makes\
    \ \nit] hard to see” (TERP13) and that Webex’s screen sharing layout \nplaces\
    \ video feeds “across the top [and] I can’t see signing at that \nscale” (D5).\
    \ \nSigners also observed the efect that the boundaries of a camera \nfeed have\
    \ on their ability to articulate themselves efectively while \nsigning. D6 explained\
    \ that VC “limits the signing space that [she] can \nuse” whereas in-person, she\
    \ “can explain stories with all the space \nthat [she has] at [her] disposal”.\
    \ For interpreter participants, they \nhad to adapt by being “more visual gestural,\
    \ a little bit more working \ntoward the camera” (TERP8) to articulate their interpreted\
    \ messages \nclearly to their clients. For instance, when conveying proper names\
    \ \nor other English concepts without ASL analogs, TERP10 modifes \n9Non-manual\
    \ markers is a term used to describe the various visual-facial gestural \nexpressions,\
    \ head tilting, eye shifting and body positioning that provide critical gram-\n\
    matical information to manual signs used in ASL conversation. \nCHI ’22, April\
    \ 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nJazz Ang et al. \nher signing approach\
    \ to “fngerspell 10right in front of the camera \n[and to] fngerspell much slower”\
    \ in an efort to increase the clarity \nof her signs. While ASL uses body positioning\
    \ to convey important \ngrammatical expressions, participants explained that the\
    \ random-\nized layout of each person’s video in a 2D space “[took] away the \n\
    ability to do that body shift for clarity” (D2), and TERP9 found that \nthe reduced\
    \ depth perception makes signs “difcult to see.” \nDifculty receiving backchannel\
    \ feedback. In addition to \nthe lack of visual-gestural clarity, participants\
    \ highlighted the in-\ncreased challenges of capturing nonverbal signals (e.g.,\
    \ nodding \nof heads, signing of ‘I understand’ or ‘yes’ etc.) to gauge active\
    \ \nlistening and understanding. While hearing people can assume the \nlistener’s\
    \ understanding by receiving verbal backchannel feedback \nor clarifcations, in\
    \ addition to nonverbal signals, D4 explained that \nfor signers to track backchannelling\
    \ over VC it is “a lot of jumping \naround with [her] eyeballs and it takes a\
    \ lot of efort”. Even in small \ngroups, screen sharing limits the ability to\
    \ see backchannel feed-\nback, and D4 found she has to “[jump] in and out of screen\
    \ share [just \nto] see the entire classroom at once”. Interpreter participants,\
    \ like \nTERP9, heavily rely on their client’s backchannel responses such as \n\
    “the nodding, the expressions” to assess their client’s comprehension \nand “modify\
    \ [their] interpreting approach” accordingly. When sign-\ners’ videos are turned\
    \ of or cannot be located, TERP8 shared how \nthis can impact interpreting confdence:\
    \ “Are they watching? Are \nthey paying attention? I don’t get any kind of feedback\
    \ in the form of \nfacial expressions or agreement. It’s just I’ve got a black\
    \ screen I’m in-\nterpreting to and that’s defating. . . that does afect my interpreting.”\
    \ \n4.1.3 Design Considerations. We now highlight potential design \nconsiderations\
    \ that can provide greater access to consuming in-\nformation. These design ideas\
    \ were often raised in interviews and \ndeepened in co-design sessions. They refect\
    \ both d/Deaf signers \nand interpreter participants’ perspectives. \nFlexibility\
    \ to resize and reorder video frames (1A). All par-\nticipants unanimously prioritized\
    \ having the control to rearrange \nany video thumbnails based on individual preference.\
    \ Signers ex-\npressed a strong preference to shift the videos to “be able to\
    \ see \nwho the deaf person is that’s signing and also see the interpreter in\
    \ \nthe same space” (D5). Some wanted to not just arrange video feeds \nwithin\
    \ a VC platform but across their monitors and other windows \nto minimize visual\
    \ dispersion and maximize the amount of infor-\nmation within their sightline\
    \ (Fig. 1A). In a remote lecture setting, \nwhere signers are often required to\
    \ multi-task, D1 wished that “I \ncould have the interpreter on the same screen\
    \ as the coding [beside] \nthe professor”. While interpreter participants had\
    \ varied preferences \nto their setup, they overwhelmingly prioritized having\
    \ their d/Deaf \nclient’s video to take up the most screen estate, such as TERP11’s\
    \ \nwish to have: “the deaf person’s window [as] a large central image \nand then\
    \ the other people surrounding that, perhaps, in thumbnails \naround where I can\
    \ reference to them quickly and easily and see who’s \nspeaking”. Despite similar\
    \ priorities, fexibility is critical to support \nparticipants with diverse needs,\
    \ contexts of use, and preferences. \nGrouped videos (1B). In three out of four\
    \ co-design sessions, \nparticipants saw value in having the ability to create\
    \ customized \n10Fingerspelling is a technique used to convey proper names, niche\
    \ vocabulary, or other \nEnglish words by spelling them out letter-by-letter,\
    \ using the manual ASL alphabet, \nwhere particular handshapes correspond to each\
    \ letter of the English alphabet. \ngroups of video feeds. D16 imagined a private\
    \ group of signers \nand interpreters “pinned or tethered together” so that if\
    \ screens are \nrearranged, “the interpreter moves with me [...] instead of getting\
    \ lost \nin the shufe of screens”. Interpreter participants stressed that this\
    \ \ncould address a key problem for accommodation service providers, \nas they\
    \ are often separated from their clients when they are sent \nto meeting ‘breakout\
    \ rooms’. In both co-design sessions with in-\nterpreter participants, they expressed\
    \ an overwhelming interest to \nautomatically have a clear sightline of signers,\
    \ where “[signers’] \nvideos will come up rather than me having to search for\
    \ each person” \n(TERP10). Some participants wanted interpreter teams to be con-\n\
    nected to signers’ video feeds so that interpreter switches could \nhappen with\
    \ less information loss. \n4.2 Communication \nHere, we describe communication\
    \ challenges participants faced \nwhile using VC. We defne communication as active,\
    \ participa-\ntive and two-way information exchange with non-signers, signers\
    \ \nand/or interpreters (e.g., having group conversations, answering \nquestions\
    \ during lectures). \n4.2.1 Geting Atention without Audio. Both d/Deaf signers\
    \ and \nASL interpreters face various challenges when they are trying to \nget\
    \ the attention of other signers on VC platforms because existing \nplatforms\
    \ are designed to identify participation through audio. \nImpact of audio-centric\
    \ platforms. Signers described how \naudio-centric VC platforms make it particularly\
    \ difcult for d/Deaf \npeople to get others’ attention and to identify when others\
    \ are \ntrying to get their attention. D5 explained this issue: “hearing people\
    \ \njust hear something and they are able to recognize that something’s [or \n\
    someone’s] getting their attention”, however, “deaf people don’t have \na similar\
    \ access”. To compensate for this inequitable access, D16 \nhas to perpetually\
    \ “hunt and peck through the sea of faces” to avoid \noverlooking when someone\
    \ is “trying to get [his] attention”. This is \namplifed by the fact that VCs\
    \ do not automatically identify active \nsigners, which can cause interpreters\
    \ to unintentionally overlook \nsigners. D2 emphasized the importance of getting\
    \ the attention \nof interpreters before signing: “sometimes I’ll just be signing\
    \ along \nand it’s dead silent in the room...someone will talk and say, did you\
    \ \njust say something?... And then the interpreter’s like, ‘oh I’m sorry. I \n\
    couldn’t see the comment. I’m so sorry.’ And that’s embarrassing. So I \ndon’t\
    \ like that. That can be a little traumatizing.” \nDeaf cultural practices. There\
    \ are many Deaf cultural prac-\ntices for getting people’s attention, but d/Deaf\
    \ signers found that \nthese approaches largely did not translate to VC. For instance,\
    \ D16, \nwho is currently teaching remotely, explained: \n“When you’re in a live\
    \ classroom with other students, \nyou can bang on the desk and get their attention\
    \ that \nway and explain things that way. Or in a classroom \nenvironment, you\
    \ can also fash the lights on and \nof, and get everybody’s attention and say,\
    \ hey, can \neverybody see me? But in this online environment \nwe’re limited.\
    \ We’re not allowed to do that. We can’t \ndo that.” - D16 \nOften, signers wave\
    \ at the person whose attention they are seek-\ning, but online, TERP7 explained,\
    \ “you’re waving at someone for like \na long time and then she’s like, oh sorry,\
    \ didn’t see you.” Participants \n“In this online environment, we’re limited”\
    \ \nCHI ’22, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nFigure 1: Co-design\
    \ workshop sketches of (a) video thumbnails of the professor and interpreter dragged-and-dropped\
    \ over the \ntop of a web browser on the user’s secondary monitor (from session\
    \ 2 with signers), and (b) three videos thumbnails (of e.g., \nsigner, ‘of’ interpreter,\
    \ and ‘on’ interpreter) in a private group that are pinned onto the top right\
    \ corner (from session 2 with \ninterpreters) \nhad not found easy alternatives,\
    \ as more extreme attention-grabbing \nmethods lack the nuance that in-person\
    \ spatial communication can \nallow: D16 had experienced people strobing fashlights\
    \ at their cam-\nera and found that “everyone’s attention is arrested and drawn\
    \ to that \none screen, but that person might just be trying to get my attention\
    \ \nor one other person’s”. \n4.2.2 Interpreting Delay. Managing delay online.\
    \ Some delay is \ninherent to all interpreting - moving between ASL and English\
    \ is a \nprocess that takes time - but signers and interpreter participants \n\
    explained that this delay was particularly difcult to manage online. \nTERP12\
    \ explained that traditionally, “when we’re interpreting, we’re \nstill back at\
    \ point B, and they’ve gone on to point C. And so there \nwould be that kind of\
    \ like that nudge or that reminder to the teacher \nor whoever was speaking to\
    \ just say, ‘OK, give me some time. I’m \ngetting caught up with that point.”’\
    \ Interpretation is an iterative \nprocess; speakers need to be aware of the pace\
    \ of interpretation \nand interpreters often ask signers to clarify their intent.\
    \ However, \nthis back and forth becomes difcult on VCs: TERP9 explained that\
    \ \n“it’s harder to ask for clarifcation, like, can you go back? Sometimes, \n\
    they don’t see me or can’t see me, and so they don’t see that request \nfor clarifcation.”\
    \ \nDifculty interjecting on VC. Interpretation delay is partic-\nularly noticeable\
    \ for signers when conversation participants are \ntaking turns – D4 explained:\
    \ “I’m thinking about what the person \nsaid, then another person has already\
    \ said something or has already \nbegun speaking. The interpreter has continued\
    \ to interpret what the \nother person is saying, while I’m still contemplating\
    \ what I just heard \nor saw”. While this makes joining conversations difcult\
    \ regardless \nof environment, an increase in interpreter delay online amplifes\
    \ \nthis struggle. D1 shared that “my interpreter’s all ready to answer the \n\
    question or to interpret the answer that I’ve given, but then somebody \nelse\
    \ has overstepped them and is answering the question, because \nthere’s a little\
    \ bit of a delay there.” Furthermore, online conversation \nnorms create particular\
    \ considerations for interpreters. TERP9 de-\nscribed how it can be “a challenge\
    \ of how to interrupt appropriately, \nthen at the same time, understand the signed\
    \ utterance, and then \ninterrupt at the right moment,” and that she often encountered\
    \ the \nattitude that “this is not the time for interruptions, which just really\
    \ \nfeels oppressive to the Deaf person.” Echoing this, some interpreters \nfeel\
    \ “less inclined to interrupt for clarifcation in a digital medium \n[. . .] like\
    \ interrupting kind of disrupts the whole thing” (TERP8). VC \ncommunication norms\
    \ do not anticipate that some participants will \nbe joining via interpreters,\
    \ and delay in the interpretation process \nmakes it harder for signers to communicate\
    \ and interject. \n4.2.3 Identifying Speakers Accurately. Active speakers. Many\
    \ \nparticipants fnd that it is difcult or impossible to correctly identify \n\
    active speakers on a VC, especially when conversations overlap. \nWhile participants\
    \ noted that Zoom’s yellow frame around active \nspeakers (D2) or Microsoft Teams’\
    \ captioning speaker identifca-\ntion (TERP9) could help bridge audio or context\
    \ gaps for speaker \nidentifcation, challenges persist. Signers sometimes rely\
    \ on inter-\npreters to identify speakers as they “can’t look at the interpreter\
    \ and \nsimultaneously look at the person speaking” (D4), but this breaks \ndown\
    \ if interpreters cannot identify the speaker well and is particu-\nlarly problematic\
    \ when multiple people speak at once. Not only do \nsigners lack full access,\
    \ but without knowing who has spoken, they \nnot are not able to “refer back to\
    \ that person or that comment” (D2). \nEye gaze. Eye contact is ill-defned and\
    \ inconsistent in virtual \nmediums, which has distinct consequences for signers.\
    \ Interpreter \nparticipants reported being unsure of norms around eye contact:\
    \ \n“where do I look? Do I look at the deaf person on screen? Do I look in \n\
    the camera when I’m trying to look at neutral space?” (TERP7). This \nresults\
    \ in ambiguity because ASL grammar relies on eye contact to \nidentify the person\
    \ a sentence is directed towards. Without clear, \nmutual eye contact on VC platforms,\
    \ it is difcult “to know if [a \nsigner is] talking to me or talking to other\
    \ students” (D3). \n4.2.4 Design Considerations. Informed by the fndings above,\
    \ we \nnow provide a summary of our participants’ recommendations and \ndesign\
    \ rationales to address these communication barriers. \nVisual and haptic feedback\
    \ (2a). Both d/Deaf signers and in-\nterpreter participants expressed great interest\
    \ in having various \nCHI ’22, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \n\
    Jazz Ang et al. \nFigure 2: Co-design workshop sketches of (a) a ‘hand waving’\
    \ visual overlay to get signer’s attention (from session 2 with \ninterpreters),\
    \ (b) screenshare view with speaker’s name clearly identifed on top and interpreter’s\
    \ screen pinned to the top \n(D1), and (c) speaker view confguration where the\
    \ speaker’s name and video is highlighted, while the interpreter’s screen is \n\
    pinned below (D5) \nnon-auditory means to get signers’ attention privately and\
    \ ef-\nciently before communicating. Signers wanted “some button[s] to \npush\
    \ to get [others’] attention” (D16) and wanted to get that warning \nwhere they\
    \ were looking, having it “pop up on my screen if that’s \npossible” (D1). Other\
    \ participants considered how they could get \nthis notifcation across the devices\
    \ they use, and D2 suggested “it \nwould be great if my phone had vibrated, or\
    \ something, to get my \nattention.” All interpreter participants suggested similar\
    \ ideas in \ntheir co-design sessions. For example, TERP10 commented how \nshe\
    \ wanted to have a “little attention grabber go across the screen” \nand TERP13\
    \ suggested it should also “go across the screen on what-\never they’re working\
    \ on” when signers are multitasking. TERP11 \nsupported their ideas and emphasized\
    \ the importance of privacy, \nproposing that the notifcation is “not open to\
    \ everybody, and it’s \njust to that deaf person who’s using the service.” \n\
    Prioritize the frames of active speakers next to ASL inter-\npreters (2b and 2c).\
    \ Identifying the active speaker was a clear \npriority across co-design sketches,\
    \ with many participants suggest-\ning that solutions could place the interpreters\
    \ and active speaker’s \nvideo feed in the same sightline. D5 proposed that active\
    \ speakers’ \n“would come to the front or be at the beginning, [so it’s] easy\
    \ to recog-\nnize who it is that’s speaking out of the sea of faces that you would\
    \ \nsee.” Participants highlighted that when their “eye gaze doesn’t have \nto\
    \ be too far-ranging” (D15) it would allow signers to capture the \nspeaker’s\
    \ backchannel feedback without missing the interpreted \nmessages. \n4.3 Collaboration\
    \ \nWe also identifed collaboration barriers, where multiple people \n(signers,\
    \ non-signers and interpreters) jointly work together, or in \na team, to produce\
    \ or act on something actively. While signers have \nshared challenges that relates\
    \ to working with others remotely, \ncommunication and consuming information were\
    \ largely the root \ncauses of those barriers, which we previously described.\
    \ Therefore, \nthis section focuses on the unique collaboration challenges that\
    \ \ninterpreters face while working via VC. \nis not familiar with a sign due\
    \ to sign accents11). When in per-\nson, clarifcation (also known as ‘feeding’)\
    \ is traditionally done \nopenly (e.g., quickly voicing a missed word), but interpreter\
    \ partici-\npants described concerns around how doing so online can cause \nunnecessary\
    \ interruptions to others and impact their perceived \nprofessionalism. \nOpen\
    \ team interpreting. While interpreters have developed \nways to discreetly communicate\
    \ with and support each other in per-\nson, these strategies break down online.\
    \ Efective team interpreting \nrequires interpreters to be able to “recognize\
    \ that something’s wrong \n[. . .and] just jump in” (TERP9) and participants such\
    \ as TERP11 \nemphasized that on VC platforms, this can be potentially disruptive\
    \ \nto others as “anything that needs to be communicated is then broad-\ncast\
    \ to everybody”. This barrier to openly ‘feeding’ information to \ntheir team\
    \ interpreters “limits [their] teaming ability” (TERP9). Some \ninterpreter participants\
    \ felt strongly about avoiding unnecessary \nattention when interpreters communicate,\
    \ and TERP9 explained: \n“I wouldn’t want a whole room of Zoom people to see me\
    \ going on \ncamera, of camera, on camera, of camera [...] and bringing so much\
    \ \nattention to the interpreter [that’s] like waving wildly”. To TERP11, \nthe\
    \ interpreter’s “goal is to disappear into the woodwork like we don’t \nexist\
    \ in that space” and “having our business out in front of everybody \nto hear”\
    \ may impact how they can build trust and be perceived as \nprofessional. TERP11\
    \ elaborated: \n“Communication is about trust and if the people in \nthe room\
    \ hear one interpreter feeding the interpreter \ntons and tons, they’re like,\
    \ ‘Wait a minute, maybe \nthis frst interpreter really isn’t doing so good.’,\
    \ and \nthat can then destroy the trust relationship in that \ncommunication and\
    \ that can then refect negatively \nupon the hearing person or deaf person.”-\
    \ TERP11 \nAltered communication channels for team interpreting. \nTo manage the\
    \ limitations of open interpreting, interpreter par-\nticipants often use alternative\
    \ communication methods that in-\nadequately support interpreting needs. Interpreters\
    \ typically ver-\nbally communicate or sign to their team interpreters in-person,\
    \ \nbut \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11Similar to spoken languages, sign languages\
    \ have diferent accents based on regions \nand individuals’ backgrounds. The same\
    \ term can be signed in diferent ways across \nAmerica and Canada. \nTERP11 now\
    \ utilizes text messaging when ‘feeding’ in the VC\n4.3.1 Interpreting with Team\
    \ Interpreters. When interpreters work \nas a team, the inactive interpreter often\
    \ needs to provide clarif-\ncations to the active interpreter (e.g., when the\
    \ active interpreter \n“In this online environment, we’re limited” \nCHI ’22,\
    \ April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nFigure 3: Co-design workshop sketches\
    \ of (a) a private room within a VC, where the ‘of’ interpreter verbally ‘feed’\
    \ the team \ninterpreter, and a pop-up text showing the feed (from session 1 with\
    \ interpreters), and (b) a grouped video (with two signers \nand two team interpreters)\
    \ communicating through a private chat room (from session 2 with interpreters)\
    \ \nbecomes disruptive: “I prefer [...] instant message because I can set it \n\
    up as a separate window and the reason I also prefer it is that privacy”. \nSimilarly,\
    \ TERP8’s team interpreters ‘feed’ by “sending [her] in text \nwhat that word\
    \ means”. Some participants expressed concerns that \nexisting means of communication\
    \ (e.g., chat, openly communicat-\ning in the main room) do not sufciently protect\
    \ client-interpreter \nexchanges, and they “do not want [the] interpreter’s discussion\
    \ to \nbe recorded” (TERP11). To curb these problems, interpreters like \nTERP11\
    \ use “two devices [to have] two channels for communication” \nand set up one\
    \ for private team communication. However, TERP9 \nexplained that the noise interference\
    \ with multiple devices can \nmake team interpreting difcult: “You need to be\
    \ able to hear exactly \nwhat’s going on and you can’t - there’s that echo - it’s\
    \ impossible for \nus to hear each other and to feed each other.” \n4.3.2 Design\
    \ Considerations. Both co-design sessions with inter-\npreter participants revealed\
    \ similar design requirements for collab-\norating with each other on a shared\
    \ virtual medium. \nPrivate communication methods (3a and 3b). Five out of \n\
    six interpreter participants largely saw value in having a private \nchannel for\
    \ team interpreters and signers to communicate without \nunnecessary attention.\
    \ TERP11 wished that “It could all be combined \ninto one device [where] we’re\
    \ all in the same, big room but I’d like to \nbe able to privately communicate\
    \ with my team”. Several interpreter \nparticipants suggested the same idea of\
    \ grouped videos (Fig. 3b) \nand expanded it to include auditory and textual means\
    \ of commu-\nnicating (Fig. 3a) to support efcient team interpreting “without\
    \ \nthe whole group hearing” (TERP9). In this example (Fig. 3a), only \nthe active\
    \ interpreter can hear the clarifcation from the inactive \ninterpreter due to\
    \ their private auditory channel. \n4.4 Hosting \nWe found that while d/Deaf signers\
    \ and ASL interpreters identifed \nsimilar problems associated with the control\
    \ VC platforms give \nto hosts, they have difering perspectives on how to resolve\
    \ those \nbarriers to accessible VCs. \n4.4.1 Control on Accessible Features on\
    \ VC. Accessible Features. \nThe accessibility features on existing platforms\
    \ are not designed \nto help the platforms’ users understand and set up accessible\
    \ con-\nferences. Setting up an accessible VC meeting requires signifcant \nforethought\
    \ and efort and the responsibility to create an accessible \nvirtual environment\
    \ is placed on the host, who must learn and \nnavigate the platform’s controls.\
    \ TERP9 observed a trend where \n“hearing people feel like they want to help with\
    \ the spotlighting and \nthen things get all messed up”, refecting that, “they\
    \ weren’t trying to \nblock access for Deaf people, but they just don’t understand\
    \ the need \nfor the spotlight. And so that was defnitely a platform problem.”\
    \ In \naddition, d/Deaf signers felt that the lack of certain permissions on \n\
    the VC platforms is a barrier to creating an accessible conferenc-\ning experience\
    \ for themselves. D4 described an experience where \nshe could not access her\
    \ interpreters on Zoom because while she \nneeded “to make sure that the interpreters\
    \ are pinned I couldn’t pin \nthem because I was not co-host.” D2 shared how this\
    \ has stifed her \nlearning experience, “[I] always kind of messed things up and\
    \ always \ntook some time at the beginning of every class...The professor was\
    \ \nlike, ‘oh jeez’. It was a little embarrassing. I mean I knew the spotlight\
    \ \nwasn’t on me but I needed that service.” \nControlling authority. While d/Deaf\
    \ signers continued to \nimagine hosts as stakeholders in making VC accessible,\
    \ many ASL \ninterpreters imagined ideal solutions where they would have the \n\
    ability to confgure VC environments independently. As meeting \nhosts are not\
    \ all familiar with the accessible features on VC plat-\nforms, ASL interpreters\
    \ sometimes “need to remind [hosts] to make \nme a co-host and it allows me to\
    \ pin multiple students at the same \ntime” (TERP10) and educate meeting hosts\
    \ that “deaf people often \nhave a preference to see who is speaking because there’s\
    \ so much [they] \ncan catch from facial expressions and that sort of thing” (TERP7).\
    \ To \nhelp meeting hosts recognize interpreters easily, before the meeting \n\
    starts, TERP8 “typically [does]..add the word, ‘interpreter’, to [her] \nname\
    \ so that people can see that and then [she] will ask the host to \nplease add\
    \ [her] and the other interpreter [as co-hosts]” and advised \nhosts to “give\
    \ the student the capability to multi-pin and so then they \ncan decide to spotlight\
    \ or what have you” (TERP8). \nThese workarounds put signifcant burdens on d/Deaf\
    \ signers \nand ASL interpreters. Interpreter participants shared that “kind \n\
    of my biggest fear is how much time do I have to get set before the \nspeaker’s\
    \ of and running and I’ve got to be set to go” (TERP14). Even \nif given access\
    \ to multi-pinned interpreters, the responsibility to \nenable accessibility still\
    \ falls on signers which creates problems \nparticularly when “the platform can\
    \ change so often and if [the \nsigners are] not aware” (TERP10). Additionally,\
    \ TERP10 explains \nthat often d/Deaf adolescents “still are not familiar with\
    \ pinning” \nCHI ’22, April 29–May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nJazz Ang et\
    \ al. \nand as an educational interpreter, is always concerned: “How do \n[students]\
    \ pin the interpreter in that meeting? . . . I’m also trying to \nteach my students,\
    \ hey, did you fnd the three dots? Have you pinned \nme? So there’s a lot of lost\
    \ time”. Interpreter participants identifed \nmany aspects of their work where\
    \ they played an active role in \nconfguring accessibility, and desired greater\
    \ autonomy in doing \nso. \n4.4.2 Design Considerations. Our participants brainstormed\
    \ some \nideas on how to make the process of setting up an accessible envi-\n\
    ronment easy for the meeting hosts, and the design considerations \nbelow are\
    \ synthesized from co-design sessions with both groups. \nCustomizable layout\
    \ templates. During our co-design ses-\nsions, both d/Deaf signers and interpreter\
    \ participants expressed \nthat future VC platforms should provide users the ability\
    \ to cus-\ntomize their layouts. As TERP 11 stated, “it would be best if we \n\
    had the freedom to set it up however it works for us.” To quickly \nenable accessible\
    \ features, TERP7 proposed that “if there were a \nfew diferent templates there,\
    \ yeah, I could see some people [could \nfnd it easily], that [would be] really\
    \ useful.” Similarly, D5 imagined \nhow the templates could be created and saved,\
    \ “you would provide \nenough time to be able to learn and familiarize yourself\
    \ with the \nchanges, and then save that [. . .] then if there was anything that\
    \ \ncame up last-minute, the host then would be able to go on ahead and \nselect\
    \ a pre-saved template from a list”. \n5 DISCUSSION \nIn this study, we designed\
    \ an accessible remote research proto-\ncol and conducted interviews and co-design\
    \ workshops with both \nsigners and interpreters. Our fndings highlighted key\
    \ accessibility \nbarriers and practical VC design considerations to mitigate\
    \ them. \nWe further provided guidelines for conducting remote research \nwith\
    \ d/Deaf signers in the future. Here, we explore and refect on \nthe larger social-cultural\
    \ impact of (un)inclusive signing on VCs, \nour responsibility as designers, and\
    \ future research considerations. \n5.1 Implications of Video Conferencing \n\
    Accessibility on Signers \nOur study has surfaced multiple VC access gaps experienced\
    \ by \nboth d/Deaf signers and ASL interpreters when consuming informa-\ntion,\
    \ communicating, collaborating, and hosting accessible virtual \nmeetings. While\
    \ our data provides in-depth insights into our partic-\nipants’ access needs,\
    \ it cannot fully encapsulate the broader social \nimplications of inadequate\
    \ VC access for the diversity of d/Deaf \nsigners, especially in non-ideal environments.\
    \ \nThe use of auditory-centric VC tools, which supposedly enable \nremote visual\
    \ communication, perpetuates speech normalcy by \nprioritizing spoken language\
    \ users (e.g., automatically spotlighting \nonly users who voice). This can make\
    \ visual communicators invisi-\nble and perpetuates other learning disparities.\
    \ Students who have \nhad to learn remotely miss out on instruction when using\
    \ inaccessi-\nble VC for school. In addition, while their hearing peers are engaged\
    \ \nin class discussions, deaf signers can become more isolated and \ndisconnected\
    \ from their community. While our d/Deaf participants, \nwho are at least 18 years\
    \ old, attempted diferent workarounds (e.g., \nusing chat, asking interpreters\
    \ to interject etc.) to participate in \nVCs, it might be difcult for younger\
    \ d/Deaf signers to use these \nsame workarounds. d/Deaf children or young d/Deaf\
    \ signers in \nremote K-12 education are at a signifcant disadvantage [2, 50,\
    \ 72] \nand this can amplify the already ongoing language deprivation \ncrisis\
    \ for d/Deaf children [28, 72]. VC limitations for d/Deaf sign-\ners directly\
    \ and indirectly reduce language exposure [3, 72]. The \nlifelong consequences\
    \ of language deprivation, such as cognitive \ndelays and mental health difculties\
    \ [28, 29], are far reaching and \nmake granting d/Deaf children access to ASL,\
    \ their frst language, \nan urgent priority. \nVC’s audio-centric design further\
    \ perpetuates the Deaf studies \nconcept of ‘phonocentrism’, or the idea that\
    \ speech and sound defne \nthe human experience [5, 7, 81]. The experiences that\
    \ signers shared \nin our study reinforces Young et al.’s [81] notion of the “translated\
    \ \nDeaf self”, where hearing people who don’t sign only come to know \ndeaf signers\
    \ through the ‘other’, treating interpreters as not just a \nconduit for communication\
    \ but as a partial representation of the \nsigner. For example, some hearing people\
    \ direct and turn their \nbodies towards the ASL interpreter, who is voicing,\
    \ instead of the \nd/Deaf signer, when communicating in-person. Existing VC design\
    \ \nenables this same bias in online environments by prioritizing the \nvoicing\
    \ interpreter’s video over the signer’s, leading hearing people \nto engage with\
    \ the voice they hear and the person they see on the \nplatform - the interpreter,\
    \ not the deaf signer. \n5.2 Refections on Future Video Conferencing \nDesign\
    \ \nTo build signer-inclusive VC solutions, designers should consider \nthe impact\
    \ of two-dimensional space on use of sign language, a \nthree-dimensional spatial\
    \ language. In addition, designers should \nuse an inclusive design approach to\
    \ consider the diverse abilities \nof all their potential users [31]. \nOur fndings\
    \ show that virtual environments limit the efective \nuse of spatial aspects of\
    \ ASL, particularly body movements, direc-\ntionality, and hand orientation. Unlike\
    \ in-person, signing on screen \nfattens and reduces the depth perception required\
    \ to efectively \nconvey relations spatially, making it so that signers have difculty\
    \ \ndescribing locative expressions, physical spaces, and subject-object \nrelationships\
    \ [25, 39]. This has a critical impact on the intelligibility \nof ASL online\
    \ because verb subjects and objects are conveyed via \nthe movement and directionality\
    \ of signs [22, 67, 76]. For example, \nto sign “I help her”, a signer begins\
    \ by positioning the handshape \nfor “help” near their body and then faces another\
    \ person and moves \ntheir hands towards her. However, if the signer moves the\
    \ hand-\nshape for “help” from the other person towards themselves, they \ninstead\
    \ convey “she helps me” – this slight diference in movement \nsignifcantly changes\
    \ the meaning of the sign. VC platform design \nrenders these locative expressions\
    \ and subject-object relationships \nvague due to its two-dimensionality and varied\
    \ screen layouts. In \naddition to the design ideas mentioned in Section 4, VC\
    \ platforms \ncould allow signers’ video thumbnails to be tethered to their in-\n\
    terpreter(s)’ thumbnail and provide an option for signers and/or \ninterpreters\
    \ to all view the same layout. This solution enables more \nnatural and accurate\
    \ sign directionality, or using manual cues, such \nas body and hand movements\
    \ (e.g., clearly pointing), to identify the \nsubject or object of a sentence\
    \ [76]. \n“In this online environment, we’re limited” \nCHI ’22, April 29–May\
    \ 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nWhile the requirements we outline serve a specifc\
    \ population, \nwe argue that designers have a professional, social and ethical\
    \ \nresponsibility to consider the diverse abilities of their users, and \nadvocate\
    \ against design that only considers the majority. Our data \nshow how only designing\
    \ for privileged majorities (e.g., hearing \nnon-signers) actively harms users\
    \ who do not ft those norms. \nExisting VC design perpetuates audist beliefs (e.g.,\
    \ only identi-\nfying speakers who voice) which requires signers to adopt diferent\
    \ \n‘workarounds’ just to be seen and heard (e.g., additional meeting \nrooms\
    \ for interpreters). Ironically, this has created visual communi-\ncation technology\
    \ (which found some of its earliest adopters in the \nDeaf community [61]) that\
    \ has little to no consideration for visual \ncommunicators. We call for an approach\
    \ to VC design that meets \nthe needs of all users and pays particular attention\
    \ to who is denied \naccess when design centers the needs of the majority. \n\
    5.3 Recommendations for Future Inclusive \nRemote Study Design \nBuilding from\
    \ our experience conducting a remote study with \nd/Deaf signers and interpreters\
    \ as a Deaf-hearing research team, \nwe refect and highlight several considerations\
    \ important for re-\nsearchers working in this space. Since our research used\
    \ the same \ninaccessible VC we were studying, we found shared problems with \n\
    our participants but tailor these considerations for future remote \nresearch\
    \ processes. \nVisual and transparent interpreting strategies. During co-design\
    \ \nworkshops, we observed that d/Deaf signers sometimes lost track of \nthe context\
    \ of the conversation, particularly when interpreters were \ndelayed in catching\
    \ up on content. To mitigate this, our research \ninterpreters spontaneously developed\
    \ a visual signal to show that \nthey are ‘catching up’ on the overlapping conversations,\
    \ letting \nd/Deaf signers know to pause before sharing a new idea. During \n\
    the pause, the interpreter was then able to quickly interject previ-\nously uninterpreted\
    \ conversations or backchannel responses (e.g., \nsigning ‘I see’, ‘I understand’\
    \ etc.). This visual signal also helped \nteam research interpreters to visually\
    \ communicate who should \ngo next when managing overlapping conversations. This\
    \ strategy, \nclosely attuned to the needs of a workshop facilitated by Deaf and\
    \ \nhearing researchers and enabled by long-term involvement of the \nsame research\
    \ interpreters, was efective in both setting accessible \nconversation norms and\
    \ ensuring that all participants’ ideas were \nshared. For future research involving\
    \ d/Deaf signers, we recom-\nmend the research team develops similar visual signals\
    \ to allow \ninterpreters to enable transparent conversation access. \nDeaf awareness\
    \ and representation. Inaccessible research meth-\nods make the Deaf community,\
    \ particularly Deaf signers, a sig-\nnifcantly understudied group [4, 55]. Anderson\
    \ et al. [4] posits \nthat linguistic and socio-political considerations should\
    \ be taken \ninto account when conducting qualitative research with the Deaf \n\
    community. In line with this call for representation and community \nengagement,\
    \ our research team consists of a Deaf researcher, two \nASL research interpreters,\
    \ two hearing accessibility researchers \nwho know basic ASL, and a hearing HCI\
    \ researcher. The identi-\nties, backgrounds, and knowledge of the research team\
    \ served to \nincrease cultural and linguistic accessibility and helped build\
    \ trust, \ncrucial for doing work with a community that researchers have \nhistorically\
    \ harmed [44, 45]. \nThroughout our research, we aligned study materials with\
    \ ASL \nlinguistics as most research activities were conducted in ASL. In \ndoing\
    \ so, we found that asking interview questions and guiding \ncodesign activities\
    \ in ASL requires providing multiple examples \nfor clarity, a common element\
    \ of ASL grammar12, but that this can \ncome into confict with researchers’ desire\
    \ to not lead or bias par-\nticipants during studies. Prior work provides precedent\
    \ for study \nprotocols conducted in ASL that heavily rely upon examples [25].\
    \ \nHowever, researchers without a deep knowledge of ASL may unin-\ntentionally\
    \ and unknowingly conduct interpreted interviews that \nbias d/Deaf signer participants.\
    \ We suggest that researchers who \nwork with d/Deaf signers approach study protocol\
    \ design with care, \nconsidering how to phrase questions and prompts that provide\
    \ \ngeneral examples that can be clearly communicated in ASL while \nnot leading\
    \ or biasing participants. \nInter-interpreter reliability. To ensure consistency,\
    \ quality, and \nto reduce bias, we worked with the same two research interpreters\
    \ \nthroughout the entire research process. Working with the same \nteam of interpreters\
    \ from study design through analysis allowed for \nfamiliarity with signing styles,\
    \ maintaining conceptual equivalence, \nand ensuring internal validity of transcribed\
    \ data across all sessions. \nBecause our researcher interpreters attended all\
    \ meetings and study \nsessions, they were aware of the study’s context and could\
    \ tailor \ntheir interpretation to most clearly match the researcher’s intent,\
    \ \nstandardizing interpretation across subsequent sessions. In addition, \nthe\
    \ research interpreters were involved in post-hoc video analysis \n[4], conferring\
    \ with researchers and reaching consensus around \ninterpretation of signs, non-manual\
    \ grammar and body language. \nThough there are no perfect interpretation solutions\
    \ between Eng-\nlish and ASL, we found that closely engaging the same research\
    \ \ninterpreters throughout the entire study process allowed for greater \n‘inter-interpreter\
    \ reliability.’ Other researchers working with sign-\ners may consider how to\
    \ more closely engage interpreters in the \nresearch process. \n6 LIMITATIONS\
    \ AND FUTURE WORK \nWe outline limitations of our study and opportunities for\
    \ future \nwork. First, most of our participants had been using videoconferenc-\n\
    ing frequently since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there-\nfore our\
    \ fndings may not refect the experiences of signers who \nare unfamiliar with\
    \ VC platforms. Second, our participants over-\nwhelmingly used Zoom, primarily\
    \ in an educational or academic \nsetting. While we did have participants refect\
    \ on other platforms \nor non-academic settings, our fndings do not equally represent\
    \ all \nVC platforms or use cases. Third, none of our participants identi-\nfed\
    \ as hard of hearing, so our fndings may not apply to hard of \nhearing signers.\
    \ Fourth, all transcription was based on our research \ninterpreter’s real-time\
    \ voicing of participants’ signing. We elected \nto place our confdence in these\
    \ interpreters, who we trust and had \nworked with prior to this study, while\
    \ acknowledging that inter-\npreting is an imperfect representation of signed\
    \ languages. Fifth, \nwe intentionally scoped our study to the experiences of\
    \ freelance, \n12ASL is not “English on the hands” and as a visual language, it\
    \ represents ideas or \nconcepts with specifc examples [4] \nCHI ’22, April 29–May\
    \ 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA \nJazz Ang et al. \ncommunity interpreters, but\
    \ future work could investigate the rel-\nevancy of our qualitative fndings and\
    \ design recommendations \nto other remote interpreting settings such as VRI and\
    \ VRS. Fur-\nther, we provide design considerations but have not implemented \n\
    them, and future work is needed to create and evaluate prototypes \nthat integrate\
    \ our design recommendations. The educational inter-\npreters who participated\
    \ in our study brought their perspectives \non the unique accessibility challenges\
    \ of interpreting remotely for \nyoung d/Deaf signers, and future work could explore\
    \ the impact \nof VC-mediated communication on young people whose linguistic \n\
    foundation in sign language is being built via a two-dimensional \nmedium. Finally,\
    \ future research could further explore solutions, \nsuch as haptics or VR, to\
    \ bridge the gap between signing in person \n(3D) versus signing in a digital\
    \ medium (2D). \n7 CONCLUSION \nWe present in-depth qualitative accounts from\
    \ eight d/Deaf sign-\ners and eight ASL interpreters which reveal the unique challenges\
    \ \nand accessibility barriers that signers and interpreters face on com-\nmercially\
    \ available VC platforms. Additionally, we uncover novel \ndesign opportunities\
    \ and practical guidelines that new and existing \nVC platforms can use to improve\
    \ access for d/Deaf signers and \ninterpreters. Throughout our participatory research\
    \ process, we \ndesigned and iterated various strategies to provide an accessible\
    \ \nremote study experience for our participants. As we look to a world \nwhere\
    \ videoconferencing remains a mainstay of work, education, \nand social lives,\
    \ we hope to help shape a medium that more fully \nsupports visual communication.\

  limitations: 'We outline limitations of our study and opportunities for future work.

    First, most of our participants had been using videoconferencing frequently since
    the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and therefore our fndings may not refect the
    experiences of signers who are unfamiliar with VC platforms.

    Second, our participants overwhelmingly used Zoom, primarily in an educational
    or academic setting. While we did have participants refect on other platforms
    or non-academic settings, our fndings do not equally represent all VC platforms
    or use cases.

    Third, none of our participants identifed as hard of hearing, so our fndings may
    not apply to hard of hearing signers.

    Fourth, all transcription was based on our research interpreter’s real-time voicing
    of participants’ signing. We elected to place our confdence in these interpreters,
    who we trust and had worked with prior to this study, while acknowledging that
    interpreting is an imperfect representation of signed languages.

    Fifth, we intentionally scoped our study to the experiences of freelance, community
    interpreters, but future work could investigate the relevancy of our qualitative
    fndings and design recommendations to other remote interpreting settings such
    as VRI and VRS.

    Fur-ther, we provide design considerations but have not implemented them, and
    future work is needed to create and evaluate prototypes that integrate our design
    recommendations. The educational inter-preters who participated in our study brought
    their perspectives on the unique accessibility challenges of interpreting remotely
    for young d/Deaf signers, and future work could explore the impact of VC-mediated
    communication on young people whose linguistic foundation in sign language is
    being built via a two-dimensional medium.

    Finally, future research could further explore solutions, such as haptics or VR,
    to bridge the gap between signing in person (3D) versus signing in a digital medium
    (2D).'

  analysis: 'Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use


    This study presents a novel approach to optimize automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management by integrating advanced Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    and machine learning (ML) algorithms. A wireless sensor network (WSN) collects
    soil moisture and canopy temperature data, which is then processed and analyzed
    using ML algorithms to make informed irrigation decisions. The proposed system
    aims to improve crop yield and water use efficiency while reducing labor costs
    and environmental impact.


    The proposed system consists of the following components:


    A wireless sensor network (WSN) for data collection:

    A wireless sensor network (WSN) is deployed in the field to collect real-time
    soil moisture and canopy temperature data. The WSN consists of multiple sensor
    nodes, each equipped with sensors to measure soil moisture and canopy temperature.
    The sensor nodes are wirelessly connected to a central gateway, which collects
    the data and transmits it to a cloud-based platform for further processing.


    Machine learning (ML) algorithms for data analysis:

    The collected data is processed and analyzed using machine learning (ML) algorithms
    to identify patterns and trends in the data. ML algorithms are used to develop
    predictive models that can estimate crop water requirements based on the collected
    data. The predictive models are used to make informed irrigation decisions, such
    as when and how much to irrigate.


    A cloud-based platform for data management and decision support:

    A cloud-based platform is used to manage the collected data and provide decision
    support to farmers. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for farmers
    to access the data and view the irrigation recommendations. The platform also
    allows farmers to adjust the irrigation schedule based on their specific needs
    and preferences.


    The proposed system has several advantages over traditional irrigation methods:


    Improved crop yield: The system provides real-time data on soil moisture and canopy
    temperature, which allows farmers to make informed irrigation decisions. This
    can lead to improved crop yield and quality.

    Reduced water use: The system helps farmers to optimize their irrigation schedule,
    which can lead to reduced water use. This is important in areas where water resources
    are scarce.

    Reduced labor costs: The system automates the irrigation process, which can reduce
    labor costs. This can free up farmers to focus on other tasks, such as crop management
    and marketing.

    Reduced environmental impact: The system helps farmers to reduce their environmental
    impact by optimizing water use. This can help to protect water resources and reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions.

    The proposed system is a promising approach to improve automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management. The system has the potential to improve crop yield, reduce
    water use, reduce labor costs, and reduce environmental impact.'

    is a key issue for decision-makers. The reservoir operation of multi-reservoir
    systems is an important aspect to consider in efforts to increase power generation.
    This research studies a multi-reservoir system comprising of the Khersan-I (KHI),
    Karoon-III (KAIII) and Karoon-IV (KAIV) with the intent being to increase power
    generation. To achieve this, the Two-Point Heading Rule was integrated with a
    new optimization algorithm, namely the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SEOA).
    The Two-Point Heading Rule was used based on four distinct scenarios, namely Two-Point
    Heading Rule (1), Two-Point Heading Rule (2), Two-Point Heading Rule (3) and Two-Point
    Heading Rule (4). The Seagull Optimization Algorithm was then used to find two
    heading parameters of the TPHRs. The Seagull Optimization Algorithm was subsequently
    benchmarked against the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Bat Algorithm (BA) and the
    Shark Optimization Algorithm (SOA). Various inflow scenarios consisting of the
    first inflow scenario (dry condition), the second inflow scenario (normal) and
    the third inflow scenario (wet condition) were considered for the optimal operation
    of this multi-reservoir system. The results indicated that the global solution
    of the MSOO based on NLP for Two-Point Heading Rule (1) under the first inflow
    scenario and was 3.22 while the average solution of Seagull Optimization Algorithm,
    Salp Swarm Algorithm, Shark Optimization Algorithm, and Bat Algorithm in respective
    order was 3.25, 3.93, 4.87 and 6.03. The results indicated that the global solution
    of the MSOO based on NLP for Two-Point Heading Rule (1) under the second inflow
    scenario was 2.14 while the average best solution of Seagull Optimization Algorithm,
    Salp Swarm Algorithm, Shark Optimization Algorithm, and Bat Algorithm in respective
    order was 2.16, 2.98, 3.96, and 4.89. It can be concluded that the SEOA outperformed
    all of the other algorithms. It was also found that the SEOA based on the Two-Point
    Heading Rule (3) under the third inflow scenario provided the most power generation
    for the KHI and KAIV systems. A multi-criteria decision was utilized to choose
    the best algorithm and heading policy. The ensuing results indicate that the SEOA
    had the best performance out of all the algorithms based on Two-Point Heading
    Rule (3) and the third inflow scenario. Previous article in issue Next article

    policyPower generation 1. Introduction Energy shortage is one of the most critical
    topics of interest to researchers because of its nature as a limited resource
    and because energy production is necessary for industry and economic growth, particularly
    in developing countries (Ehteram et al., 2017). The field of water resource planning
    and management focuses on the optimal operation of dam reservoirs and multi-reservoirs,
    which is essential because the water behind dams is one of the key sources of
    power generation as it has been estimated that the hydropower industry supplies
    20% of the world’s total power generation (Tayebiyan et al., 2019, Tayebiyan et
    al., 2016). The determination of volume and water release time for downstream
    demands such as hydropower plants is a central topic for policy-makers (Jahandideh-Tehrani
    et al., 2020). The Multi-reservoir System Operation Optimization (MSOO) is one
    of the most vital water resource management facets. It plays an integral role
    in systems related to power generation (Ehteram et al., 2018). The MSOO is considered
    a complex, nonlinear, and dynamic optimization problem with different objective
    functions and constraints similar to other optimization problems. In order to
    adequately solve the MSOO, decision- and policy-makers have to use mathematical,
    and optimization methods to precisely determine numerous parameters such as boundary
    conditions, downstream demands and maximum and minimum values for reservoir storage
    and released water. Although approaches such as dynamic programming or linear
    programming methods could optimize various systems in water resource management,
    they do have certain drawbacks (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2016). Because the multi-reservoir
    problem has some objective functions and constraints, the dynamic programming
    method may not find optimal solutions in the shortest possible time. In contrast,
    linear programming methods cannot be used for problems with nonlinear objective
    functions. Recently, Optimization Algorithms (OPA) has been widely applied in
    solving MSOO problems. Fast convergence, high flexibility, high accuracy, and
    advanced operators’ usage are distinct advantages of optimization algorithms (Ehteram
    et al., 2017). Numerous researchers in previous studies have applied OPAs extensively
    to optimize the operation of dam reservoirs. Afshar (2012) utilized a Partially
    Constrained Particle Swarm Optimization (PCPSO) algorithm to optimize Iran’s Dez
    dam’s hydropower operation, whereby the PCPSO was used for short, medium and long
    operation periods of the reservoir. The said author found that the PCPSO performed
    better in increasing power generation than the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
    and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Dariane and Sarani (2013) optimized the operation
    of the Dez reservoir in Iran using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and the Intelligent
    Water Drop (IWD) algorithm. They found that the IWD had lower computational time
    as compared to the ACO. Ahmad et al. (2014) used a multi-objective genetic algorithm
    to increase power generation in Iran’s Karoon 4 dam, whereby various inflow scenarios
    were used in their study. A comparison between long-term operation and Real-Time
    Operation (RTO) indicated that the latter’s rules were flexible and accurate.
    In another study, Aboutalebi et al. (2015) integrated the Multi-Objective Genetic
    Algorithm (MOGA) with Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Nonlinear Programming
    (NLP) to determine the optimized release for hydropower generation. It was found
    that the MOGA-SVR and NLP was a useful combination of tools to compute the optimal
    operation rules for hydropower reservoirs with a reliability index of 90%. Asgari
    et al. (2016) used the Weed Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to optimize the performance
    of single and multi-reservoir systems with the intention being to increase power
    generation. The said authors subsequently reported that the solutions provided
    by the WOA were near to globally optimal solutions. An extant study by Bozorg-Haddad
    et al. (2016) used the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for solving four reservoir
    optimization problems. It was observed that the GSA converged to 99.97% of the
    global solution. The earlier-mentioned PSO was applied by SaberChenari et al.
    (2016) to supply the multipurpose Mahabad reservoir dam’s downstream demands in
    Iran. The study considered the released water as the decision variable and concluded
    that the PSO performed well in minimizing the reservoir water loss. Another approach
    was taken by Bahrami et al. (2018) in their study that utilized Cat Swarm Optimization
    (CSO) to attain a hypothetical four-reservoir system’s optimal operation and increase
    its total power generation. The study authors observed that the CSO had superior
    performance and high efficiency in finding global solutions. A study by Asadieh
    and Afshar (2019) used the Charged System Search Algorithm (CSSA) to derive hydropower
    operating policies. They reported in their findings on the superiority of the
    CSSA in attaining optimal operation of single and multi-reservoir systems based
    on its fast convergence. In addition, a hybrid PSO was developed using a Differential
    Evolution (DE) algorithm by Ahmadianfar et al. (2019), after which it was used
    to increase the power generation of a power plant. It was subsequently found that
    this hybrid DE-PSO improved the local and global search abilities of the basic
    DE. (Al-Aqeeli and Mahmood Agha, 2020) and also used PSO to extract optimal operation
    policies for maximizing annual hydroelectric generation. The said authors found
    that PSO was very capable of supplying optimal levels of hydropower energy. Each
    optimization algorithm has its unique abilities. Bozorg-Haddad et al. (2015) reported
    that the Bat Algorithm (BA) based on a random walk operator could exit local optimums.
    Ahmadianfar et al. (2016) coupled BA with DE to increase the BA population’s diversity
    to optimize multi-reservoir systems’ operation. Ehteram et al. (2017) reported
    that the Shark Optimization Algorithm (SOA) based on rotational movement could
    exit local optimums, thereby showing that it is a robust algorithm for the optimal
    operation of single and multi-reservoir systems. Another study by Ehteram et al.
    (2018) found the kidney algorithm to be a powerful algorithm for the optimal operation
    of water resource systems because of a lower number of random parameters and fast
    convergence. To sum up, as is evident from numerous extant sources in literature,
    many researchers are trying to develop or make use of new optimization algorithms
    for complex systems in water resource management (Soghrati and Moeini, 2020).
    2. Problem statement and innovations The energy management for Multi-Reservoir
    System Operation Optimization (MSOO) is an important issue for decision-makers.
    Thus, it is necessary to have a comprehensive plan and management for the optimal
    operation of the MSOO. Thus, the heading policies can be used to produce more
    power for downstream demand. Also, it is important to have enough storage for
    critical periods such as drought periods. To determine the released water and
    reservoir storage based on the heading polices, the heading parameters should
    be obtained based on the optimization algorithms. Thus, the optimal operation
    of MSOO based on heading policies for increasing power generation is an important
    topic. There are different policies to optimize the operations of water resource
    systems. Heading Policy (HP) is one of the most straightforward policies for optimal
    operation of water resource systems. HP is a good option for decreasing the severity
    of droughts with the best use of available water resources. It can reduce future
    water deficits by accepting a smaller current shortage prior to the droughts.
    HP is also a good idea for MSOO because it maintains water at the current time
    in order to increase water head in future. Thus, HP can affect the water head
    and reservoir storage, two parameters that are important for MSOO. Huang et al.
    (2016) used the Three-step Hedging Rule Curves (THRCs) to optimize reservoir operations.
    The authors concluded that THRC increased the reservoir storage to meet future
    demands. In a study by Tayebiyan et al. (2016), various heading policies were
    applied to increase power generation. It was then surmised that the application
    of heading policies increased the reliability of the reservoir system. For a similar
    purpose of attaining optimal operation of a reservoir system, Kumar and Kasthurirengan
    (2018) used a Linear Two-Point Hedging Rule (LTPHR). The study’s results showed
    that the LTPHR had better performance when compared to the conventional standard
    operating policy. Tayebiyan et al. (2019) optimized the operation of a reservoir
    system using PSO and GA with different heading policies. The said study’s results
    suggest that the utilization of heading policies could increase the power generation
    by a margin of 13% in comparison to historical management. When using heading
    policies, decision-makers should find relevant parameters such as rationing parameters.
    As discussed in the preceding section, optimization algorithms are competent in
    water resource management. The optimization algorithms could be used to find decision
    variables such as rationing parameters. Therefore, integrating heading policies
    and optimization algorithms is advantageous and beneficial for water resource
    management. One of the newest optimization algorithms is the Seagull Optimization
    Algorithm (SEOA) which was inspired by the behavior of seagulls in nature. The
    main advantages of the SEOA include less random parameters, a good ability to
    explore search space based on spiral movement and its fast convergence. The SEOA
    is a robust optimization algorithm that has different advantages such as fast
    convergence, a good balance between exploration and exploitation, avoiding trapping
    in local optimums, and easy implementation for different optimization problems.
    In a study by Dhiman and Kumar (2019), SEOA was utilized to solve mathematical
    functions and engineering optimization problems. It was observed that the SEOA
    outperformed other optimization algorithms such as Spotted Hyena Optimizer, GA,
    GSA and the Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm. Cao et al. (2019) used an improved
    version of SEOA for the optimal parameter identification of fuel cells. It was
    found that the improved SEOA had better performance in terms of the quality of
    the solution when compared to the original version of SEOA. In the operation of
    MSOO, there are gaps between energy demand and generated power. Also, the MSOO
    should supply the required demands during the critical periods such as drought
    periods. To reduce the gaps between the demand and generated power, water resource
    planning and management based on optimization algorithms is used for solving such
    complex problems. The contributions of this paper include (1): the utilization
    of new optimization algorithms for the optimal operation of MSOO, (2): preparing
    a mathematical model for the operation of MSOO based on heading policies, and
    (3). The study of the operation of MSOO based on different inflow scenarios and
    (4): coupling heading policies with optimization algorithms. The SEOA is used
    in this study to solve an MSOO in Iran. The current study possesses the following
    innovations: 1- To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, there are no extant
    studies that investigated the capability of SEOA in solving MSOO. 2- This study
    uses three heading policies for optimal operation of a multi-reservoir system
    and the SOA is used to find the rationing parameters. 3- The performance of the
    SEOA was benchmarked against other powerful optimization algorithms such as the
    Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Bat Algorithm (BA) and also the Shark Optimization
    Algorithm (SOA). The bat and salp swarm algorithm are selected because of high
    ability for solving different optimization problems. SSA is one of the new optimization
    algorithms that is widely used for different fields such as machine learning,
    engineering design, wireless networking, image processing (Abualigah et al., 2020).
    The bat algorithm is also used for the current study because it has a high ability
    for water resource management (Ahmadianfar et al., 2021, Bozorg-Haddad et al.,
    2015, Ehteram et al., 2018). Also, previous literature indicated that the SSA
    and BA outperformed the GA and PSO to solve optimization problems (Mirjalili et
    al., 2017). Thus, the BA and SSA are used instead of using PSO and GA to investigate
    the SEOA. 4- The operation of the multi-reservoir system is performed with due
    consideration of the different inflow scenarios in the multi-reservoir systems
    in Iran. 5- A multi-criteria decision was utilized to choose the best heading
    policy and optimization algorithm. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no article
    in the literature has studied the ability of the SEOA used for optimal operation
    of the MSOO. Another novelty of the current paper is to couple heading policies
    with optimization algorithms for optimal operation of water resource systems.
    The following second section explains the case optimization algorithms and heading
    policies in greater detail. The case study and mathematical models of multi-reservoir
    systems are delved into in the third section. This is followed by the fourth section,
    which talks about the discussion and results of the study. The study’s conclusion
    is presented in the fifth and final section. 2.1. Seagull optimization algorithm
    Seagulls are considered as sea birds. There are assorted species of seagulls,
    all of which have diverse bodily characteristics such as length and mass (Dhiman
    and Kumar, 2019). Researchers have reported that seagulls are highly intelligent;
    they purportedly produce rain-like sounds with their feet to attract earthworms
    to come up to the surface. While most animals do not drink both freshwater and
    saltwater, seagulls do (Dhiman and Kumar, 2019). The attacking and migration patterns
    of seagulls are their most important behavioral traits. Seagulls use their seasonal
    movements, more commonly termed as their migration behavior or pattern, to find
    the most abundant sources of food (Dhiman and Kumar, 2019). The following three
    assumptions are made regarding seagulls (Dhiman and Kumar, 2019): 1- Seagulls
    carry out their migration behavior in a swarm. The exact location of each seagull
    is distinct to prevent them from colliding with each other. 2- In a group, seagulls
    can move towards the direction of the best seagull. The best seagull signifies
    the optimal solution with the best value of the fitness function. 3- Seagulls
    change their location based on their initial position. In an optimization problem,
    the seagulls use the following equation for migration. The SOA uses the A variable
    to avoid colliding with each other: (1) (2) where : the final location of the
    seagull, : the current location of the seagull, x: the current iteration number,
    : the control parameter, and : maximum number of iterations. The seagulls then
    move towards the direction of their best neighbor: (3) where : the location of
    the seagull in relation to the best seagull, : the position of the best seagull,
    and : balancing parameter. The parameter is responsible for balancing exploration
    and exploitation (Dhiman and Kumar, 2019): (4) whereby r: random number. The seagulls
    change their location based on the location of the best seagull: (5) where : the
    distance between the seagull and the best seagull. While seagulls move, they can
    change their angle of attack and speed. Seagulls use the spiral movement for attacking:
    (6) (7) (8) (9) where r: the radius of each turn of the spiral, k: a random number,
    u and v: constant coefficients for defining the spiral movement, and e: base of
    the natural logarithm. The updated location of seagulls after the spiral movement
    is as follows: (10) Download : Download high-res image (460KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of SSO. Fig. 1 shows the steps of SOA for an
    optimization problem. 2.2. Shark Optimization Algorithm (SOA) The Shark Optimization
    Algorithm is one of the most potent optimization algorithms available. It has
    been widely used in various scenarios, such as solving mathematical functions
    (Abedinia et al., 2016), building load forecasts (Mohammadi et al., 2018), medical
    image enhancement (Zhou et al., 2020), training artificial neural networks (Seifi
    et al., 2020), optimal operation of reservoirs (Ehteram et al., 2019) and cloud
    jobs scheduling (Suliman et al., 2019). True to its namesake, the SOA was inspired
    by the behavior of sharks. The rotational movement of sharks is a significant
    operator in the SOA for exiting local optimums. In SOA, some assumptions are made,
    and they are as follows (Abedinia et al., 2016): 1- The injured fish is regarded
    as prey to the sharks. 2- The sharks try to find the injured fish by receiving
    the blood particles from the injured fish’s body. 3- The velocity of the injured
    fish is neglected against the velocity of the shark. In SOA, the sharks’ positions
    are considered as candidate solutions of the optimization problem (Abedinia et
    al., 2016): (11) where : the th initial position, : the th dimension of th shark
    position, and ND: number of decision variables. When the sharks are in close proximity
    to the injured fish, they receive strong odor particles, at which point they increase
    their velocity. The sharks change their velocity as follows: (12) where : the
    th dimension of the th shark velocity, : velocity limiter, : inertia coefficient,
    i: stage number, , : random numbers, of objective function, and : random number.
    The sharks perform the forward movement (FM) using the previous position and velocity
    of sharks: (13) where : new location of th shark based on the FM, : time interval,
    : the current position of th shark, and : time interval. The sharks use rotational
    movement to escape from local optimums: (14) where : the location of sharks after
    rotational movement, ; random number, M: number of points in the local search.
    If a maximization problem is considered, the final location of sharks is calculated
    as follows: (15) Fig. 2 shows the flowchart of the SOA. Regarding the flowchart
    of the SOA, the location of sharks are initialized randomly. Then, the objective
    function is computed for each agent. The best shark with the best objective function
    is determined. Then, the location and velocity of the sharks are updated. Download

    The flowchart of SOA. 2.3. Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) The SSA was inspired by
    the behavior of salps. SSA has been utilized extensively in different situations
    such as in feature selection (Ibrahim et al., 2019), parameter optimization of
    a power system (Ekinci and Hekimoǧlu, 2018), training ANN (Panda and Majhi, 2020),
    frequency control of power systems (Mohanty and Panda, 2021) and engineering design
    problems (Mirjalili et al., 2017). An adaptive mechanism for balancing between
    exploration, exploitation and simplicity in implementation are the advantages
    of the SSA. Its swarming behavior is one of the key characteristics of salps.
    The population of salp chains is divided into two groups: leader and followers.
    The followers follow the leader which is placed at the front of the chain. The
    swarm’s target is one food source in the search space. The location of the leader
    is updated as follows: (16) where : the position of the food source, : the upper
    bound of th dimension, : the lower bound of th dimension, , , and : random numbers,
    and : the position of the leader. The position of followers is updated as follows:
    (17) where : the location of th follower in th dimension. Fig. 3 shows the pseudo
    code of the SSA. As observed in Fig. 3, the initial population of the SSA is defined
    based on the locations of salps. Then the objective function is computed for each
    agent. The best agent with the best value of the objective function is known as
    a leader. Then, the leader and followers update their locations based on Eqs.
    (16), (17). Download : Download high-res image (506KB) Download : Download full-size

    optimization algorithm that is widely used in diverse applications such as parameter
    extraction of photovoltaic models (Deotti et al., 2020), image enhancement domain
    (Dhal and Das, 2020), training extreme learning machine models (Dong et al., 2020),
    satellite formation strategy (Hou et al., 2021), feature selection (Qasim and
    Algamal, 2020) and optimal control of a power system (Pati et al., 2020). Quick
    convergence and excellent in both exploration and exploitation are advantages
    of the BA. To get a sense of distance and to identify the difference between obstacle
    and food, bats use their unique echolocation ability. In each iteration, the pulsation
    rate and loudness of the bats are updated. First, a random population of bats
    is initialized. The bats’ positions are regarded as decision variables. The frequency,
    velocity and the location of the bats changes as follows: (18) (19) (20) where,
    : random number, : minimum frequency, : maximum frequency, : the best solution,
    :the velocity of th bat at iteration t, : the position of th bat at iteration
    t-1, : frequency of th bat, and : the location of th bat at iteration t. The bats
    use a random walk as a local search: (21) ɛ : new position of bat, : old position
    of bat, : loudness, and ɛ : random number. The bats’ pulsation rate and loudness
    are changed as follows: (22) where and : constants, : pulsation rate of th bat,
    : loudness of th bat at iteration t+1. Fig. 4 indicates the flowchart of BA. As
    observed in Fig. 4, first, the initial population and random values of parameters
    are defined. Then, the value of the objective function is computed for each bat

    optimal operation of reservoir systems (OORS) is used to determine the amount
    of rationing to be done in each time interval. Decision makers use heading rules
    to ensure that high downstream supply demands could be met even with the uncertainties
    in inflow at reservoirs. There are a variety of heading rule polices. In this
    study, two-point heading rules are used because of their track record of successful
    applications in previous studies. For instance, Bayazit and Unal used the Two-Point
    Heading Rules (TPHR) for the OORSs, whereby it was found that the TPHR decreased
    the risk of very large future shortages. Another study by Srinivasan and Philipose
    (1996) introduced a modified TPHR with three parameters, namely Starting Water
    Ability (SWA), Ending Water Ability (EWA) and Heading Factor (HF). The said authors
    observed that the reservoir storage with enough water could significantly reduce
    vulnerability index. Shiau (2011) introduced new types of TPHR to optimize the
    operations of a reservoir. It was observed that these new TPHR types could decrease
    vulnerability by redistributing the shortages over a longer period of time. A
    study conducted by Kumar and Kasthurirengan (2018) used a linear TPHR for investigating
    the trade-offs between deficit characteristics, total deficit ratio and vulnerability
    resulting from the operation of a reservoir in India. It was observed that the
    linear TPHR improved the performance of the studied reservoir during its operational
    period. To explain TPHR in more detail, some salient points regarding feasible
    heading domain based on Fig. 5 are listed as follows: 1- Any point on shows that
    system releases water without Carryover Storage (CS). 2- Any point on indicates
    that the released water from the system meets demands while the remaining Water
    Available (WA) contributes to the CS. 3- Any point on signifies that the system
    does not release water until the Storage Capacity (SC) equals WA. 4- Any point
    on shows that only WA that is in excess of SC is released. In this study, four
    combinations of TPHRs is used, specifically: 1- TPHR (1): In the first group of
    TPHRs, SWA is placed on the . The EWA is placed on the . Thus, the values of SWA
    and EWA are variable from 0 to and from to +k, respectively. Fig. 6a shows TPHR
    (1) and its associated equations. The release policy based on TPRH (1) is observed
    in Fig. 5a. As can be seen in Fig. 5a, two parameters, namely HP1 and HP2, are
    known as heading parameters. OPAs are used to determine the values of heading
    parameters. Equations in Fig. 5a are extracted from Kumar and Kasthurirengan (2018).
    2- TPHR (2): In the second group of TPHRs, the SWA is placed on the while the
    EWA is placed on the . The SWA is variable from 0 to K. The EWA is variable from
    SWA +D and +K because the slope of heading rule should be less than unity. As
    observed in Fig. 5b, parameters HP1 and HP2 are known as heading parameters. OPAs
    are used to determine the values of heading parameters. Equations in Fig. 5b are
    from Kumar and Kasthurirengan (2018). 3- TPHR (3): In the third group of TPHRs,
    the SWA is placed on the while the EWA is placed on the . The SWA is variable
    from 0 to and the EWA is variable from SWA +K and +K to ensure the slope of the
    heading rule is positive. As seen in Fig. 5c, parameters HP and HP are known as
    heading parameters. OPAs are applied to determine the values of heading parameters.
    The equations in Fig. 5c are taken from Kumar and Kasthurirengan (2018). 4- TPHR
    (4): In the fourth group of TPHRs, the SWA is placed on the and the EWA is placed
    on the . The SWA is variable from 0 to K while EWA is variable from K and +K to
    ensure the slope of the heading rule is positive. As shown in Fig. 5d, two parameters,
    namely HP and HP , are known as heading parameters. OPAs are used to determine
    the heading parameters values. Equations in Fig. 5d are obtained from Kumar and
    Kasthurirengan (2018). Download : Download high-res image (880KB) Download : Download

    optimal operation of a multi-reservoir system, which includes the Khersan-I (KHI),
    Karoon-III (KAIII), and Karoon-IV (KAIV) reservoirs (Fig. 6a and b). This multi-reservoir
    system is located in the southwestern region of Iran. More specifically, the KHI
    reservoir is situated in the Charmahal Bakhtiari Province at the latitude of 30°
    31 and the eastern longitude of 26° 50 . The main purpose of the KHI reservoir
    is hydropower production and it has a mean annual inflow of 1351.42*106m3 (Fig.
    6c). The KAIV reservoir is situated at the higher part of the Karoon River and
    its intended purpose is for flood control and power production. This reservoir
    is located at a northern latitude of 35° 31 and an eastern longitude of 50° 24
    . Meanwhile, the KAIII reservoir is the Khozestan province of Iran at a northern
    latitude of 31° 48 and an eastern longitude of 50° 05 . Water supply for domestic
    consumption, flood control, and power production were the main aims of constructing
    the KAIII reservoir. Table 1 shows the characteristics of these three reservoirs.

    of the th period. (25) (26) (27) (28) where : the th reservoir water level at
    the starting of the th period, , , , , and : constant coefficients (these coefficients
    are used to convert the reservoir storage to its corresponding height and the

    (29b) where : reservoir storage at time t+1, : reservoir storage at time t (MCM),
    : inflow to a reservoir at time t (MCM), : reservoir release at time t (MCM),
    : spillway at time t, : the water storage area i at the starting at the period

    the release from a reservoir to other reservoirs), and : the matrix of routing
    of the system for transferring overflow amounts from upper to lower reservoirs,
    : water availability. In this study, the following constraints were used: (30)
    (31) (32) where : minimum release of the th reservoir at period t, : maximum release
    of the th reservoir at time t, : minimum reservoir storage of the th reservoir
    at period t, : maximum reservoir storage of the th reservoir at period t, : reservoir
    storage at the starting of period t, : reservoir storage at the end of period
    t. If the constraints are not satisfied, the following penalty functions were
    used: (33) (34) where and : constants of the penalty function, and : penalty functions.
    The historical inflow to reservoir varies from one period to the next period.
    The historical inflow to the reservoir may be higher or lower than the average
    historical inflow. Thus, the different inflow scenarios to the system should be
    considered. In this study, three inflow scenarios were considered: 1- First scenario:
    Average mean monthly inflow −0.5 * standard deviation 2- Second scenario: Average
    mean monthly inflow 3- Third scenario: Average mean monthly inflow ＋0.5 * standard
    deviation 3.1. Mathematical model of optimal operation of reservoir systems In
    this study, OPAs are used to optimize the performance of a multi-reservoir system
    in Iran by finding heading parameters. The stages involved in the MSOO are as
    follows: 1- The random parameters of optimization algorithms and the initial population
    of optimization algorithms are initialized. The heading parameters of the four
    TPHR policies are taken to be the decision variables. 2- The initial values of
    the heading parameters in the four TPHR groups were estimated. In order to decrease
    the dimensionality and complexity of the problem, it is commonly assumed that
    the heading parameters are the same from year to year but variable from one month
    to the next. Therefore, there are 24 decision variables in all because the heading
    parameters vary in the 12 months. 3- The release policies in Fig. 5a to d were
    used to determine the released water based on the previously estimated heading
    parameters. 4- The reservoir storage for each month is calculated based on the
    continuity equation. 5- If the released water and reservoir storage satisfy the
    constraints, then the penalty functions are not used; otherwise, the said penalty
    functions are used. 6- The OBF is calculated. 7- The number of operation periods
    is compared with the total number of operation periods. If the former exceeds
    the latter, then the algorithm goes to the next level; otherwise, the algorithm
    goes to step 4. 8- The operators of OPAs are used to update the heading parameters.
    In fact, the heading parameters are encoded based on the locations of agents of
    the OPAs. The OPAs try to find the best position (the best value of the heading
    parameters). 9- If the number of iterations is more than the number of maximum
    iterations, the algorithm finishes; otherwise, the algorithm goes to step 4. 3.2.
    Evaluation of model performance In this research, different indexes are used to
    evaluate the performance of the various algorithms: 1- Time Reliability Index
    (TRI) (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2017): TRI shows the number of periods that the generated
    power is more than or equal to the installed capacity as follows: (35) where TR:
    number of periods in which the power produced exceeds , PPC: installed capacity.
    2- Volumetric Reliability Index (VRI) (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2017): VRI shows
    the percentage of produced power in relation to the maximum producible power in
    all operational periods: (36) where : total produced power in all operational
    periods, and T.PP : the maximum producible power in all operational periods. 3-
    Residency Index (RI) (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2017): RI indicates how a multi-reservoir
    system quickly comes out from failures: (37) where : number of periods when the
    system comes out from failures, : total failures in all operational periods. 4-
    Vulnerability Index (VI) (Bozorg-Haddad et al., 2017): VI shows the average value
    of failures during operational periods: (38) where : total shortage of produced
    power. High percentages of the aforementioned VRI, TRI, and RI indexes show the
    ideal optimization algorithm. Conversely, a low percentage of the VRI index shows
    the best optimization algorithm. 3.3. Multi-criteria decision model In this study,
    a multi-criteria decision model is used to determine the best optimization algorithm
    and heading policy. The Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) is
    a useful multi-criteria model for selecting the best method or strategy in different
    studies. Its simplicity in implementation and history of successful applications
    in water resource studies are the main reasons for utilizing the WASPAS. In this
    study, the average values of the objective function and the VRI, TRI, RI, and
    VI indices are utilized to assess the performance of OPAs and heading rule polices.
    The best methodology based on different evaluation criteria and WASPAS are detailed
    as follows: 1- The values of evaluation criteria are normalized as follows: (39)
    (40) where : maximum value of beneficial criteria, : minimum value of nonbeneficial
    criteria, : value of a creation. 2- The summation ( ) and multiplication ( ) weighted
    WASPAS are computed using the following equations: (41) (42) where n: number of
    evaluation criteria, : weight of each creation. 3- The scoring index is computed
    as: (43) where : a variable parameter from 0 to 0.10 and : scoring index. If the
    scoring index of method A is larger than that of method B, then method A is deemed
    to outperform method B. 4. Discussion and results 4.1. Sensitivity analysis of
    random parameters of optimization algorithms OPAs have random parameters (RP)
    that are effective in enhancing their accuracy. Therefore, when using OPAs, it
    is essential to find the best value of RPs. A sensitivity analysis means the variations
    in the value of the OBF are investigated versus the variations in the value of
    the random parameters. When the value of a parameter is varied, the values of
    other parameters are fixed. Taking the operation of reservoir systems under TPHR
    (1) and the first scenario of inflow as an example, the sensitivity analysis of
    random parameters is performed based on Table A.1. The minimization of the objective
    function is the aim of this study. When the OBF achieves its minimum value based
    on varying the values of RPs, then the best values of RPs are introduced. For
    example, the population size of the SEOA varied from 50 to 200 and the best value
    for population size of the SEOA varied from 50 to 200. The best population size
    of the SEOA was found to be 100 because the OBF value was at its smallest (8.25)
    then. For parameter A, its value varied from 6.0 to 1.2. The best value of parameter
    A was deemed to be 1.0 because the minimum value of the OBF occurred at A 1.0.
    Finally, the value of parameter varied from 1.60 to 2.0 and its best value was
    determined to be 1.8 because the least value of the objective function occurred
    at . By adhering to a similar process as the one mentioned, the best values of
    RPs for other algorithms are tabulated in Table A.1. Additionally, Table A.2 shows
    the best RP values for other heading policies and inflow scenarios. 4.2. Discussion
    and results of 10 independent runs for different algorithms Researchers commonly
    use a regime of ten independent runs to gauge the quality of solutions and the
    performance of optimization algorithms. In this study, Lingo 11 was employed to
    test the SEOA’s ability to converge the global optimum. Lingo is a comprehensive
    solver designed to solve linear as well as nonlinear problems and it has a completely
    integrated package based on powerful language for expressing optimization problems.
    In this study, the Nonlinear Programming Method (NLP) of Lingo was used to solve
    the MSOO problem. The solution provided by Lingo was obtained after 8 h of processing
    time using a computer equipped with an Intel Core i7 (2.93 GHz) processor. It
    is thus evident that Lingo needed a long period of time to solve the MSOO problem.
    Also, the software may not be successful in finding the optimal solution for problems
    with high levels of complexity and a large number of constraints and decision
    variables. The solution resulting from the NLP method was regarded as a global
    solution and was subsequently utilized to evaluate the capabilities of the algorithms.
    Table A.3 shows the results for ten independent runs based on TPHR (1). As observed
    in Table A.3, SEOA decreased the average OBF values of SSA, SOA and BA by 18%,
    35% and 43%, respectively. The global solution of the MSOO based on the NLP approach
    was 3.22 while the average solution of SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA in respective order
    was 3.25, 3.93, 4.87 and 6.03. It was observed that the variation coefficient
    of solutions provided by the BA was more than those resulting from other algorithms.
    The SEOA under the third scenario decreased the average OBF of the SEOA under
    the second and the first scenario by 12% and 41%. The global solution of the MSOO
    under the second scenario was 2.14. It is of note that the average solution of
    the SEOA was closer to the global solution when compared to the average solution
    provided by the other algorithms. Table A.3 shows the results of ten random runs
    for the algorithms according to TPHR (2). As observed in Table A.3, the average
    solution provided by the SEOA under the first scenario was 23%, 35% and 53% of
    those resulting from the SSA, SOA and BA. The coefficient of variation of the
    SEOA was lower than those of the other algorithms under the three inflow scenarios.
    The best solution of the SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA under the third scenario was 2.34,
    3.25, 3.68 and 4.12, respectively. From the comparison of results between TPHR
    (1) and the TPHR (2), it is indicative that TPHR (1) had better performance than
    TPHR (2). The average solution of TPHR (1) using SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA under the
    third scenario was 20%, 25%, 14% and 18% lower than the average solution of TPHR
    (2) using the same aforementioned algorithms under the third scenario. In TPHR
    (1) and TPHR (2), the third inflow scenario provided better solutions than its
    two counterparts. Table A.3 shows ten random results for TPHR (3). It can be seen
    that under the third scenario, the SEOA decreased the average OBF value by 7%,
    40% and 55% as compared to the SSA, SOA and BA. The global solution of the MSOO
    based on TPHR (3) under the second scenario was 2.12 while the average SEOA solution
    was 2.14, which is deemed to be close to the said global solution. A comparison
    made between TPHR (3) with TPHR (2) and TPHR (1) indicated that TPHR (3) outperformed
    the latter two. The average OBF of TPHR (3) using SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA under
    the third inflow scenario was 45%, 59%, 43% and 34% lower than the average OBF
    of TPHR (2) using a similar set of algorithms under the same inflow scenario.
    In the case of TPHR (3) and by using SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA under the third inflow
    scenario decreased the average OBF of TPHR (1) with the same set of algorithms
    under the third inflow scenario by 33%, 46%, 37% and 21%, respectively. Next,
    Table A.3 presents the results of ten independent runs for TPHR (4). Under the
    third scenario as shown, the SEOA decreased the OBF by 30%, 34% and 41% in comparison
    to SSA, SOA and BA. The global solution of the SEOA under the first scenario was
    3.48 whereas the average OBF of SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA was 3.56, 4.69, 5.47 and
    7.66, respectively. A comparison of the obtained results indicates that the SEOA,
    SSA, SOA and BA based on TPHR (4) under the third scenario increased the average
    OBF of the same set of algorithms based on TPHR (3) under the third scenario by
    a magnitude of 50%, 62%, 42% and 34%, correspondingly. Thus, a comparison between
    TPHR (4) with TPHR (3), TPHR (2) and TPHR (1) indicates that TPHR (4) provided
    the worst solutions when compared to the others. The behavior of the different
    optimization algorithms indicated that the SSEOA provided reliable solutions because
    the coefficient of variation of SSEOA was lower than those of the other algorithms.
    Regarding the obtained average solutions for different optimization algorithms,
    the SSEOA had a higher ability because the average solution of the SSEOA was close
    to the global solution. It indicated that the SEOA had a high ability for global
    search. The performance of the SEOA under different inflow conditions was reliable
    because of the low value of the coefficient of variation. Thus, the performance
    of the SEOA was not limited to the special condition. 4.3. Investigation of algorithm
    performance based on boxplots Fig. 7 illustrates the boxplots of the models according
    to all of their runs. Fig. 7a shows the boxplot of the obtained solutions in all
    runs based on the first inflow scenario. As can be seen from Fig. 7a and based
    on the first inflow scenario and TPHR (1), the maximum, minimum and median of
    SEOA was 4.12, 4.02 and 3.89, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 7a, the domain
    of variations of the SEOA solutions was lower than those of the other algorithms.
    TPHR (3) provided the best solution out of all algorithms, whereby the maximum,
    minimum and median of SEOA based on TPHR (3) were 3.76, 3.55 and 3.02, respectively.
    Conversely, the BA coupled with TPHR (4) provided the worst results. Fig. 7b shows
    the attained results based on the second inflow scenario from which it is evident
    that the SEOA based on TPHR (3) provided the best solutions. The maximum, median
    and minimum of the SEOA based on TPHR (3) were 3.55, 3.02 and 2.35, correspondingly.
    Because the objective function is the minimization of power deficit, this denotes
    that the maximum solutions were in fact the worst solutions. A comparison made
    of the boxplots of the second and the second inflow scenarios showed that the
    algorithms had better results in the first inflow scenario. The median of the
    boxplot of the SEOA based on the first inflow scenario for TPHR (1), TPHR (2),
    TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) was 4.02, 4.24, 3.95 and 4.30, respectively; whereas the
    median of the boxplot of the SEOA based on the second inflow scenario for the
    same order of heading rules was 3.42, 3.88, 3.02 and 3.98, respectively. The results
    of box plots based on SEOA indicated that the performance of the SEOA under different
    inflow conditions and heading policies was more liable than those of other algorithms.
    Thus, the good performance of the SEOA was not limited to a particular inflow
    condition or heading policy. Fig. 7c represents the boxplot of the algorithms
    based on the third inflow scenario. The maximum, median and the minimum of the
    SEOA based on TPHR (3) were 2.28, 2.0 and 1.5, respectively. As shown by Fig.
    7c, the SEOA based on TPHR (3) returned the best results while the BA based on
    TPHR (4) provided the worst. However, when comparing the results of the SEOA based
    on TPHR (3) in the third scenario against the SEOA based on TPHR (3) in the first
    and second scenarios, it is found that the SEOA in the third scenario had better
    performance relative to the other scenarios. The height of the boxplots of the
    SEOA in the three inflow scenarios signifies that the domain of variations of
    the SEOA solution is lower than those of other algorithms. Thus, it can be surmised
    that the solutions provided by the SEOA were more reliable than those given by
    the other algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (966KB) Download : Download

    of convergence curves for algorithms In order to investigate the convergence of
    algorithms, the convergence curves of the algorithms based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2),
    TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) under the first inflow scenario were taken as samples and
    examined further. Based on Fig. 8, the SEOA converged to lower values of OBF earlier
    than the other algorithms. For example, in the case of TPHR (1), the SEOA converged
    to 3.24 at iteration number 230, whereas the SSA, SOA, and BA converged to 3.91,
    4.98, and 5.94 at iterations 370, 390, and 405, respectively. With regard to the
    other TPHR policies, the SEOA also converged to lower OBF values earlier than
    SOA, SSA and BA. Thus, the SEOA could converge to the lowest value of the OBF
    based on a few iterations. It indicated that the SEOA had a high ability for global
    and local searches. 4.5. Investigation of average generated power using different
    algorithms Fig. 9a shows the average power produced for the system at KAIV based
    on the first inflow scenario. The power produced using SEOA based on TPHR (1)
    was 1.5%, 14%, and 18% higher than the power generated by the SSA, SOA and BA
    based on TPHR (1) under the first inflow scenario. For TPHR (3) under the first
    inflow scenario, the SEOA’s power generation was higher than those obtained by
    the SSA, SOA and BA by 2.4%, 12% and 16%, respectively. When compared, the power
    produced via SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the first inflow scenario was 1.6%,
    3.2% and 14% higher than those produced by the SEOA based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2)
    and TPHR (4). Fig. 9b illustrates the average produced power for the KAIII system
    based on the first inflow scenario. The power generated by the SEOA based on TPHR
    (3) was 2.05%, 24% and 25% higher than the power produced using SSA, SOA and BA
    under the same heading rule, respectively. Fig. 9c represents the average power
    generation for the system at KHI based on the first inflow scenario. The SEOA
    based on TPHR (3) and the BA based on TPHR (4) resulted in the highest and lowest
    amounts of produced power, respectively. In sequence, the specific amounts of
    power generated by the SEOA based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2), TPHR (3) and TPHR (4)
    were 423 (106W), 410 (106W), 478 (106W) and 399 (106W). Fig. 9d shows the average
    produced power for the KAIV system based on the second inflow scenario. As observed
    in Fig. 9d, the SEOA based on TPHR (3) generated the most power. The power generated
    by using SEOA based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2), TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) were 835 (106W),
    802 (106W), 894 (106W) and 715 (106W), sequentially. Based on the results obtained,
    it was found that TPHR (3) is the best heading policy for all optimization algorithms.
    Fig. 9e shows the average power produced for the KAIII system based on the second
    inflow scenario. The power produced via the use of BA and based on TPHR (1), TPHR
    (2), TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) were 920 (106W), 868 (106W), 1256 (106W) and 800 (106W),
    respectively. From here it is evident that the SEOA based on TPHR (3) had the
    best performance in terms of power generation. Fig. 9f shows the average power
    generation for the KHI system based on the second inflow scenario. Application
    of the SEOA based on TPHR (3) increased power generation relative to the SSA,
    SOA and BA by 10%, 17% and 19%, respectively. These results indicate that optimization
    algorithms based on TPHR (3) provided more power than the other heading polices.
    Fig. 9g shows the average power produced for the KAIV system based on the third
    inflow scenario. As observed in Fig. 9g, the SEOA based on TPHR (3) had the best
    performance. The SEOA based on TPHR (3) increased generated power by 7.1%, 19%
    and 22% in relation to the SSA, SOA and BA, respectively. It is of note that the
    BA based on TPHR (4) provided a much lower power output compared to the other
    methods. Fig. 9h shows the average produced power for the KAIII system based on
    the third inflow scenario. In sequence, the power produced using SEOA based on
    TPHR (1), TPHR (2), TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) were 1472 (106W), 1237 (106W), 1839
    (106W) and 1232 (106W). Here, it was observed that the SEOA outperformed the other
    algorithms. Finally, Fig. 9i shows the average produced power for the KHI system
    based on the third inflow scenario. As can be seen in Fig. 9i, TPHR (3) and TPHR
    (1) provided higher power generation than THPR (2) and TPHR (4). A detailed comparison
    of the obtained results indicates that the algorithms based on the third inflow
    scenario provided higher levels of power production than their two other counterparts.
    For the (KAIII) system, the SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the third inflow scenario
    increased power generated by the SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the first and the
    second inflow scenarios by 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. The generated power using
    SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the third inflow scenario was 1839 (106W), while
    the power generated using SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the second inflow and first
    inflow scenarios were 1834 ((106W) and 1567 (106W), respectively. Download : Download

    and i: (KHI) system under the third inflow scenario. The general results of this
    section indicated that the selection of heading policy and the optimization algorithm
    is an issue important because the different optimization algorithms based on different
    heading policies could provide different values of power. Also, the performance
    of optimization algorithms and heading policies rely on the kind of inflow scenarios.
    Thus, SEOA based on using advanced operators could demand the required power downstream.
    4.6. Investigation on the water level of reservoirs Water released and water head
    are two important parameters for power generation. When the reservoir storage
    is high, then the head is also correspondingly high. A smaller volume of released
    water may be enough to generate the required power if the water level of the reservoir
    is suitable for power generation. Thus, the water level of reservoirs has a key
    role to play in optimal operation and also in how to address MSOO problems in
    an ideal manner. In this section, the boxplots of the water level of the reservoirs
    based on their operation using different algorithms were investigated. Fig. 10a,
    b and c present the water level for the KAIV system under various inflow scenarios.
    As observed in Fig. 10a, b and c, the water levels of the reservoir using SEOA
    based on TPHR (3) under the first, second and third inflow scenarios were noticeably
    higher than those of the other algorithms and polices. The water level of the
    reservoir based on SEOA with TPHR (3) and the third inflow scenario varied from
    1018 m to 1023 m. Conversely, the water level of the system based on BA under
    TPHR (4) and the first inflow scenario varied from 990 m to 1005 m. Thus, the
    optimal operation of the reservoir based on BA with THPR (4) and under the first
    inflow scenario led to the lowest reservoir water level. As seen in Fig. 10b,
    the algorithms in the second inflow scenario had higher water levels than in the
    first inflow scenario. Fig. 10d, e and f show the water level for the KHI system
    under different inflow scenarios. The reservoir water level based on SEOA with
    TPHR (3) and the first, second and third inflow scenarios varied from 1006 m to
    1008 m, 1008 m to 1010 m and 1009 m to 1012 m, respectively. Therefore, it is
    evident that the third inflow scenario and TPHR (3) kept the reservoir water at
    relatively high levels. The water level based on BA with TPHR (4) and under the
    first, second and third inflow scenarios varied from 1002 m to 1006 m, 1003.2
    m to 1007 m and 1003.3 m to 1007.2 m, sequentially. Again, it is clear that the
    third inflow scenario and TPHR (3) kept water levels relatively high. Fig. 10g,
    h, and i show the water level for the KAIII system under different inflow scenarios.
    The water level based on SEOA with TPHR (3) and the first, second and third inflow
    scenarios varied from 818 m to 835 m, 829 m to 835 m and 830 m to 839 m, respectively.
    TPHR (4) under the first inflow scenario resulted in the lowest water levels across
    the different algorithms. After TPHR (3), TPHR (1) under the third inflow scenario
    provided high water levels suitable for power generation. The general results
    of the different algorithms under different inflow scenarios and heading policies
    indicated that the computed water level of different algorithms was varied from
    minimum value to maximum value. Thus, the water level of the systems under critical
    conditions such as the first inflow scenario is now lower than the minimum water
    level of reservoirs. The utilization of constraints and penalty functions gives
    accurate results for the used optimization algorithms. Download : Download high-res

    operation of reservoir systems based on evaluation criteria Fig. 11a shows the
    value of VRI of the whole system for different inflow scenarios and TPHRs. Higher
    values of VRI denote that the generated power by the whole system is close to
    the expected value that is the installed capacity of power plants. Thus, it ensures
    an optimal operation of the whole system. As observed in Fig. 11a, TPHR (3) under
    the third inflow scenario provided the highest VRI value among the other inflow
    scenarios and TPHRs. The VRI value of the whole system based on TPHR (3) using
    SEOA was determined to be 94%, whereas the VRI of the whole system based on TPHR
    (1), TPHR (2) and TPHR (4) using SEOA was 90%, 81% and 77%. The BA based on TPHR
    (4) under the first inflow scenario provided the lowest value of VRI as compared
    to the other algorithms. However, a lower inflow to reservoirs could be a significant
    obstacle in efforts to achieve high VRI. It had been observed that apart from
    the SEOA, the SSA based on TPHR (4) under the third inflow scenario had the best
    values of VRI. Fig. 11b shows the TRI values of the whole system. The TRI is computed
    based on the number of periods that the generated power is at least equal to the
    expected value, which is the installed capacity. Thus, higher values of TRI ensure
    no power shortages occur in more periods. The TRI value of SEOA based on TPHR
    (3) under the third inflow scenario was 91, whereas the TRI values of SEOA based
    on TPHR (1), TPHR (2) and TPHR (4) were 89%, 79% and 75%, respectively. The TRI
    value of the BA based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2), TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) under the first
    inflow scenario was 80%, 69%, 86% and 68%, consecutively. Thus, the BA based on
    the first inflow scenario provided the lowest values of TRI. Finally, Fig. 11c
    shows the values of RI for the whole system. When the system has high RI values,
    it means that the reservoir systems can escape earlier from failure periods. As
    observed in Fig. 11d, the RI values obtained using SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA based
    on TPHR (3) under the third inflow scenario was 63%, 62%, 60% and 59%. It can
    hence be surmised that TPHR (3) under the third inflow scenario had the best performance.
    In contrast, the whole system could not recover from failure based on TPHR (4)
    under the first inflow scenario. Fig. 11d shows the VRI values for the whole system.
    Higher values of VRI denote a reservoir system that is performing poorly because
    it also signifies more power shortages for the operation periods. As seen in Fig.
    11c, the SEOA based on TPHR (3) and the third inflow scenario returned low VRI
    values. The TRI value of the SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the third inflow scenario
    was 12, while the TRI values of the SEOA based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2) and TPHR
    (4) were 18, 19 and 24%, respectively. The whole system based on TPHR (4) under
    the first inflow scenario had more power shortages compared to the other scenarios.

    for optimal operation of reservoir systems In this section, the best algorithm
    based on different heading polices and inflow scenarios shall be assessed and
    ultimately selected. The average objective function, computational time, TRI,
    VRI, VI and RI were used as evaluation criteria for selecting the best algorithm
    overall. Table 2 lists the computational algorithms used in this study. As shown
    in Table 2, the SEOA found the optimal solutions in the shortest time. Apart from
    the SEOA, the SSA was found to be the second-best algorithm. Table A.4 presents
    the values of and for the algorithms based on different TPHRs and inflow scenarios.
    Then, the values of and were used to compute the values in Table A.5. The values
    for were computed for the various values of which were variable from 0 to 1. To
    determine the best method and a general ranking of methods in terms of their performance,
    the value of for the various algorithms in each interval of was compared. For
    instance, the value of for the SEOA based on TPHR (3) and the third inflow scenario
    ( ) was computed to be 0.8823 and it was higher than the other 47 values of .
    Hence, this is considered to be one ‘win’ for the SEOA method. Table A.6 shows
    that the number of wins for the SEOA was found to be 11 against the other algorithms
    based on the various heading polices and inflow scenarios. Similarly, the overall
    rank and the number of wins for the other methods were also computed using the
    same approach detailed above. The ensuing results indicate that the SEOA based
    on TPHR (3) under the third inflow scenario outperformed the other methods. Table

    General discussion on results 1. In this research, several optimization algorithms
    were used to optimize the operation of reservoir systems based on TPHR. Nevertheless,
    other heading rule policies, such as the one point heading policy or the three-point
    heading policy, could also be used in future research. 2. In this study, the algorithms
    were applied to determine the heading parameters and then to evaluate the performance
    of each of TPHR separately. However, upcoming studies could strategize accordingly
    so that the best heading policies could be determined without requiring each policy’s
    performance to be evaluated separately. The current study’s methodology tests
    each of the TPHRs separately with regard to reservoir operation. The best policy
    is then selected based on a thorough comparison of the various evaluation criteria.
    Plainly, this makes the whole process a long one. To shorten the computational
    process, two objective functions could be defined, whereby one objective function
    can be defined to find heading parameters while the other is used to determine
    the best heading policy based on a multi-objective algorithm. In fact, the multi-objective
    version of the optimization algorithms could be used to provide a Pareto front.
    Then, each solution of the Pareto front determines the optimal value of the heading
    parameters along with the best TPHR. This way, the multi-objective algorithm automatically
    gives the optimal value of the heading parameters and also the best heading policy
    to use. In this condition, there are three decision variables. HP , HP and the
    kind of heading policy. 3. Future studies can consider the uncertain nature of
    certain variables such as inflow to the reservoir or the evaporation value from
    the reservoir and their effects on the reservoir’s operation. 4. Table 3 shows
    the optimal values of the heading parameters for the SEOA based on TPHR (3) under
    the third inflow scenario as the best model. To determine the volume of released
    water, the SWA and EWA are computed based on the formula in Fig. 5c. The SWA and
    EWA are placed on the and , respectively. If HP is equal to 1, the SWA and EWA
    are equal to D*HP and K+D * HP . As observed in Fig. 5c, there are four forms
    for determining released water. After determining SWA and EWA , the water availability
    is calculated, and then the released water is determined based on one of the probable
    forms in Fig. 5c. 5. The optimal operation of reservoir systems is reliant on
    climate conditions. Forthcoming studies could consider the effects of climate
    conditions on the optimal operation of reservoir systems so that adaptive heading
    policies that take climate conditions into account are used to increase the power
    generation of hydropower plants. Under these conditions, the inflow to the reservoir
    should be predicted and considered as a climate condition. 6. To shorten the time
    taken by the computation process, the coefficient of heading parameters varied
    from one month to the next, but it remained the same from one year to the following
    year. Future studies could consider adding another scenario for finding heading
    parameters. The heading parameters can be considered to be variable for all months
    of the operational period so that they are variable not only from one month to
    the next but also from one year to the next year. Under these conditions, advanced
    systems should be used to find the values of the heading parameters for the second
    scenario. Table A.1. Sensitivity Analysis for random parameters of optimization

    it crucial to successfully and effectively supply the required demands. The optimal
    operation of MSOO is necessary in order to increase power generation. In this
    study, optimization algorithms were used to optimize the performance of MSOO in
    Iran. The TPHR was used to improve the performance of MSOO and heading parameters
    were taken to be the decision variables. The SEOA was used as a new algorithm
    to optimize the reservoir operations under various inflow scenarios. The KAIV,
    KAIII and KHI systems were considered as multi-reservoir systems. The comparison
    of TPHR (3) against TPHR (2) and TPHR (1) indicated that TPHR (3) had better performance
    than its aforementioned counterparts. The average OBF of TPHR (3) using SEOA,
    SSA, SOA and BA under the third inflow scenario improved the average OBF of TPHR
    (2) using SEOA, SSA, SOA and BA under the third inflow scenario by 45%, 59%, 43%
    and 34%, respectively. With regards to power production, the SEOA based on TPHR
    (3) increased power generation of SSA, SOA and BA by 10%, 17% and 19%, respectively.
    It was found that the optimization algorithms based on TPHR (3) provided more
    power generation than the other heading policies. The results indicated that the
    power produced using SEOA based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2), TPHR (3) and TPHR (4) were
    1472 (106W), 1237 (106W), 1839 (106W), and 1232 (106W) for the KAIII system based
    on the third inflow. It was observed that the SEOA outperformed the other algorithms.
    The generated power for the KHI system based on the second inflow indicated that
    the SEOA based on TPHR (3) increased power generation relative to the SSA, SOA,
    and BA by 10%, 17%, and 19%, respectively. In addition, the boxplot of the various
    models according to the water levels of the reservoir systems was obtained. It
    was then found that the third inflow scenario and TPHR (3) kept water at high
    levels. Specifically, the water level based on SEOA with TPHR (3) and the first,
    second and third inflow scenarios varied from 818 m to 835 m, 829 m to 835 m and
    830 m to 839 m, respectively, for KAIII system. The VRI of the whole system based
    on TPHR (3) using SEOA was 94%, while the VRI values of the whole system using
    SEOA but based on TPHR (1), TPHR (2) and TPHR (4) instead were 90%, 81%, and 77%.
    The resiliency and vulnerability indexes revealed that the SEOA had the best performance
    out of all the algorithms used. A multi-criteria decision was utilized to choose
    the best method. The results indicate that the SEOA based on TPHR (3) under the
    third inflow scenario had the best overall performance. Table A.5. The computed

    be used to optimize complex systems in water resource management. 2- Coupling
    different heading policies and optimization algorithms lead to different results
    during the operational periods. 3- The performance of an optimization algorithm
    under heading policy should be investigated under different inflow conditions.
    4- The evaluation of the performance of different optimization algorithms should
    be performed based on a multi-criteria decision and different indices in water
    resource management. Future studies can use other optimization algorithms to solve
    MSOO. Moreover, optimization algorithms based on different heading policies could
    be applied to optimize the operations of water resource systems for power generation
    management. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mohammad Ehteram: Conceptualization,

  title: Optimal operation of multi-reservoir systems for increasing power generation
    using a seagull optimization algorithm and heading policy
  verbatim_quote1: Power generation is an important issue for decision-makers. The
    reservoir operation of multi-reservoir systems (MSOO) is an important aspect to
    consider in efforts to increase power generation. This research studies a multi-reservoir
    system comprising of the Khersan-I (KHI), Karoon-III (KAIII) and Karoon-IV (KAIV)
    with the intent being to increase power generation. To achieve this, the Two-Point
    Heading Rule was integrated with a new optimization algorithm, namely the Seagull
    Optimization Algorithm (SEOA). The Two-Point Heading Rule was used based on four
    distinct scenarios, namely Two-Point Heading Rule (1), Two-Point Heading Rule
    (2), Two-Point Heading Rule (3) and Two-Point Heading Rule (4). The Seagull Optimization
    Algorithm was then used to find two heading parameters of the TPHRs. The Seagull
    Optimization Algorithm was subsequently benchmarked against the Salp Swarm Algorithm
    (SSA), Bat Algorithm (BA) and Shark Optimization Algorithm (SOA). Various inflow
    scenarios consisting of the first inflow scenario (dry condition), the second
    inflow scenario (normal) and the third inflow scenario (wet condition) were considered
    for the optimal operation of this multi-reservoir system. The results indicated
    that the global solution of the MSOO based on NLP for Two-Point Heading Rule (1)
    under the first inflow scenario and was 3.22 while the average solution of Seagull
    Optimization Algorithm, Salp Swarm Algorithm, Shark Optimization Algorithm, and
    Bat Algorithm in respective order was 3.25, 3.93, 4.87 and 6.03. The results indicated
    that the global solution of the MSOO based on NLP for Two-Point Heading Rule (1)
    under the second inflow scenario was 2.14 while the average best solution of Seagull
    Optimization Algorithm, Salp Swarm Algorithm, Shark Optimization Algorithm, and
    Bat Algorithm in respective order was 2.16, 2.98, 3.96, and 4.89. It can be concluded
    that the SEOA outperformed all of the other algorithms. It was also found that
    the SEOA based on the Two-Point Heading Rule (3) under the third inflow scenario
    provided the most power generation for the KHI and KAIV systems. A multi-criteria
    decision was utilized to choose the best algorithm and heading policy. The ensuing
    results indicate that the SEOA had the best performance out of all the algorithms
    based on Two-Point Heading Rule (3) and the third inflow scenario.

    • Deep learning to distinguish between synthetic debris and marine life • Original
    database of underwater imagery • Convolutional neural network binary classification
    Abstract With the global issue of marine debris ever expanding, it is imperative
    that the technology industry steps in. The aim is to find if deep learning can
    successfully distinguish between marine life and synthetic debris underwater.
    This study assesses whether we could safely clean up our oceans with Artificial
    Intelligence without disrupting the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems. Our
    research compares a simple convolutional neural network with a VGG-16 model using
    an original database of 1644 underwater images and a binary classification to
    sort synthetic material from aquatic life. Our results show first insights to
    safely distinguishing between debris and life. Previous article in issue Next

    pollutionMarine debris 1. Introduction 1.1. Background Marine debris has a devastating
    effect on marine life. Mammals, sea birds and larger fish are frequently found
    to have ingested litter or have become entangled within nets and other materials,
    such as plastics (D’Aurelio, 2019, McAdam, 2017, Day, 1980, Bjornadal et al.,
    1994). This results in lethal consequences as plastic fragments absorb toxic materials
    and are highly contaminated with biphenyl polychlorinated (PCB), heavy metals
    and other noxious substances. Often leached out of common plastics are organophosphate
    esters (OPEs), particularly organophosphate flame retardants (OFPRs), though the
    effects are still not fully understood, this group of additives has been associated
    with a toxic effect on animals and humans, corresponding with different carcinogenic
    properties, diabetes and reproductive issues (Sala et al., 2021). OPEs have been
    detected within marine vertebrates; such as in studies with loggerhead turtles
    (Caretta caretta) and the first evidence of OFPRs has been detected within fin
    whales (Balaenoptera physalus) as well as their main diet source, krill (Meganyctiphanes
    norvegica)(Garcia-Garin et al., 2020a). Once ingested, plastic consumption will
    likely cause other repercussions including reproductive disorders, hormone changes,
    higher disease risk or most commonly; obstructing the gastrointestinal tract;
    resulting in starvation and fatality (D’Aurelio, 2019, Mato et al., 2001, de Stephanis
    et al., 2013). Additionally, entanglement causes a serious threat to marine ecosystems
    (Stelfox et al., 2016, Tekman et al., 2022). As well as an “inestimable number
    of birds, turtles, fish and other species” (WAP, 2018, WAP, 2014). At least 136,000
    pinnipeds and whales; are killed every year by discarded fishing equipment (France-Presse,
    2011). The consequence of high whale fatalities is that they are key contributors
    to the ecosystem of phytoplankton. This is crucial, as phytoplankton “contribute
    at least 50 percent of all oxygen to our atmosphere” and capture “an estimated
    40 percent of all [Carbon Monoxide] CO produced.” Acting as the equivalent of
    1.7 trillion trees or four Amazon rain forests; our environment depends on phytoplankton
    populations (Chami et al., 2019). This global dilemma not only impacts marine
    life and the environment but human health also, as micro plastics are now being
    discovered within all water systems (McAdam, 2017, Viehman et al., 2011) and ultimately,
    human consumption (Luo et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Sharma and Chatterjee,
    1987). The level of health risks are rising in correlation with fish consumption,
    as a study by Garcia-Garin et al. (2020b) concludes that by consuming contaminated,
    edible fish such as the bogue species (Boop boops), OFPRs are ingested, with their
    potential toxic effects and a recent discovery has even now detected nano plastics
    in our blood (Vethaak and J, 2021). Even though this is an accelerating issue,
    a solution has not yet come to fruition. Therefore, it is critical we begin to
    use technology to address the above challenges. Although our piece of research
    is a very small aspect of the bigger picture, it has the potential to be a vital
    part of the first application of deep learning to clean up our oceans and water
    systems. By successfully distinguishing between waste and fauna, an artificial
    intelligence framework could eventually be applied to automation, protecting our
    rapidly declining marine life and improving the negative impacts on human health.
    The application of machine learning to detect and classify litter, is still very
    minimal but far outweighs the efficiency of current methods which are hugely time
    consuming and extremely limited. They also require manual labour and are susceptible
    to human error. Being “one of the most pervasive and solvable pollution problems
    plaguing the world''s oceans and waterways” (Sheavly and Register, 2007), it is
    critical we invest more research into deep learning as a progressive solution.
    The aim is to successfully use deep learning methods to distinguish between synthetic
    debris and aquatic life by using the following objectives: • Collect a coloured
    (RGB) image database, that includes underwater debris and marine life in a variety
    of settings. • Compare the train and test results of two CNN frameworks against
    this new database, to categorise synthetic waste and marine fauna successfully.
    2. Gaps in the current literature Most studies on the application of Artificial
    Intelligence [AI] have neglected to consider the appropriate safety measures involved
    with clearing the ecosystem without causing further harm. Interestingly, popular
    categories studied in the oceans are plastic bottles, bags and food packaging,
    however, disregarded fishing nets cause a high fatality and are responsible for
    the greatest percentage of plastic in the ocean and one of the categories responsible
    for the highest fatalities (Lebreton et al., 2018, WAP, 2018). Furthermore, many
    studies including (Garcia-Garin et al., 2021) only considered floating plastics,
    which contributes to a very minimal percentage of marine litter. Although the
    problematic debris is found near the surface where creatures mistake it for food
    or something to play with, therefore ingesting it (D’Aurelio, 2019, McAdam, 2017),
    most of the ocean''s plastic is in micro form and found in the deepest parts (Peng
    et al., 2018). Moreover, only 1 % of marine litter floats (Ferries, 2021). Most
    algorithms in current research are only looking at three or four separate categories.
    These categories (usually including plastic bags, bottles and straws) represent
    only a tiny portion of the vast quantity of synthetic debris currently polluting
    our oceans (Jambeck et al., 2015) that is continuing to rapidly expand (Lebreton
    et al., 2018). Additionally, the image databases used to identify and categorise
    these specific objects do not account for varying degrees of degradation and subsequent
    distortion to captured imagery from wear, being underwater and sea conditions
    (light, density, turbulence). There are also a plethora of conditions that such
    an algorithm would have to work under, with visibility being the most important
    factor. The authors in some of the papers are in fact currently testing this problem
    in real life ocean scenarios; however, current prototypes will still need further
    development, particularly in rivers which have completely different conditions
    and are responsible for approximately 1.15–2.41 million tonnes of plastic entering
    our oceans (Lebreton et al., 2017). Recent work on the Great Garbage Patch by
    de Vries et al. (2021) has proven to successfully use AI to track parts of the
    patch by collecting photographic data with a GPS enabled GoPro from above the
    waterline. Using a convolutional neural network [CNN] to detect debris, they were
    able to survey the litter and map out the garbage patch in better detail. 3. Related
    work The paper on using deep learning to detect floating debris by Kylili et al.
    (2018) used VGG-16 pretrained on ImageNet to successfully train their own data
    set (after having applied transfer learning), to classify their research with
    a success rate of 86 %. Their paper focused on floating debris and to collect
    their data, they had to use a large amount of augmentation to create a dataset
    consisting of 12,000 images, which were classified into three different categories:
    bottles, buckets and straws at a testing accuracy of 99 %. Fulton et al. (2019)
    compared training four object detection methods (including R-CNN, YOLOv2, Tiny-YOLO
    & SSD) and concluded that Faster R-CNN had the highest accuracy, at the compromise
    of speed. YOLOv2 had an accuracy that was close to the R-CNN results, but it performed
    faster. They discovered that marine debris can be detected in real time using
    deep learning visual object detection methods - although this was from the surface
    and the authors do express their belief that it could be used underwater if the
    data limitations are overcome. de Vries et al. (2021) recently studied whether
    they could trace macro debris location and transportation. They used a two-fold
    approach, testing both the Faster RCNN and YOLOv5 architectures. The authors found
    that YOLOv5 outperformed FRCNN with the quantity of objects detected and with
    the smallest object size, however, they report this could be due to the hyper-parameter
    settings they applied. They go on to explain that YOLOv5 only needed minimal changes
    for better performance and that both network architectures could have been further
    improved with more optimization. They successfully produced, what they describe
    as “the first real-world demonstration of a large-scale automated camera transect
    survey of floating marine litter”; however due to limitations (such as that they
    are currently unable to detect anything smaller than macro debris), they believe
    their work is a strong framework for a method ology, rather than an example of
    findings. An alternative experiment aiming to track and identify floating marine
    debris compared the use of CNN with a ‘bag of features’ method (Sreelakshmi et
    al., 2019). The CNN used convolutional and bottleneck layers achieving 77.5 %
    accuracy when classifying. However, the bag of features method only achieved a
    62.5 % accuracy (using MatLab & SURF features). Comparing the two results clearly
    indicates that CNN was more accurate with an added benefit of speed - it took
    half the computational time that the Bag of Features needed. Another application
    of AI to detect marine debris was explored by Wang et al. (2019) using Long Short
    Term Memory Network (LSTM) with Cross Correlations and Association rules (Apriori)
    to identify characteristics of water pollutants. They discovered that the water
    quality correlation maps they produced were in fact able to accurately identify
    fluctuations effectively. Whilst this is useful to detect where large quantities
    of litter are within the ocean, this would work better as a technology used in
    addition to a Deep Learning algorithm, to encourage accurately pinpointing our
    largest problematic areas (Wang et al., 2019). Particularly as they have claimed
    that their AI scheme could potentially work within aquatic systems. The paper
    by Chazhoor et al. (2021) bench marked the three widely implemented architectures
    on the WaDaBa data set to find out the best model with the support of transfer
    learning. To ease the recycling process worldwide, seven different types of plastic
    have been categorised based on their chemical composition. These are Polyethylene
    Terephthalate (PET or PETE), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polyvinyl Chloride
    (PVC or Vinyl), Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE), Polypropylene (PP), and Polystyrene
    (PS or Styrofoam). PET, HDPE PP and PS dominate the household waste and segregating
    them into their respective types will allow the reuse of certain types and recycling
    of other types of plastics. The paper is the first benchmark paper aimed towards
    classifying different types of plastics from the images using deep learning models,
    and this has stimulated the research in this area and serve as a baseline for
    future research work. To conclude, the current algorithms available are successful
    and effective; however, comparing the studies, the results clearly indicate that
    CNN was the most accurate and fastest approach. Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNN) can train themselves on debris and continue to learn using transfer learning,
    concluding in highly accurate and efficient results (Kylili et al., 2018). Within
    this research, we have collated an extensive and original database of not only
    litter but also aquatic life with an emphasis on submerged imagery that covers
    a diverse and comprehensive range of data. Incorporating different sea conditions,
    light levels and depths, as well as all varieties of synthesised materials and
    in various stages of degradation (or other distortions). This is important to
    ensure that the CNN does not just learn what is correct but also what is incorrect.
    Our paper is especially unique in its binary classification - we split all the
    data into two simple categories of what is ‘living’ and what is not - putting
    the protection of the ecosystem and of life as the priority and trained the system
    how to differentiate between the two with a current accuracy of 89 %. Therefore,
    picking up most synthesised matter and avoiding (protecting) aquatic life. It
    also covers a broader spectrum of items rather than focusing on specific categories
    at a specific depth. Therefore, training it to recognize properties of either
    debris or life, rather than single items. We have used data augmentation to diversify
    the different aspects of images as well as increasing the number of images to
    deal with class imbalance issues. 4. Materials and methods 4.1. Database collection
    A diverse range of organisations and dive centres collaborated with us by providing
    their images. We clearly outlined a list of requirements including: • In colour
    and as high quality as possible. • Dimensions for objects photographed would need
    to be larger than microplastics and smaller than roughly 16″2. • Preferably, they
    would also have some general labels We also specified including any of the following
    within their imagery: • Underwater Litter • Underwater Nets • Underwater Animals
    (this can include fish, crustaceans, cnidaria etc) • Underwater Plants • Anything
    else miscellaneous that is ecological and shot underwater The main database acquired
    was obtained from Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).
    JAMSTEC has a huge database of sub marine images and footage of deep-sea debris
    in Japan called J-EDI. Their imagery was suitable for different depths, density
    and light but also for the variety of objects within the photos, with different
    levels of degradation. The dataset we obtained included a vast array of marine
    fauna as shown in Fig. 1 including but not limited to (fish, jellyfish, shells,
    starfish, anemone) as well as an even wider selection of synthetic debris as shown
    in Fig. 2 (nets, masks, cardboard, plastic bags, plastic sheets, cloth). As we
    wanted diversity in our database, it was particularly useful to receive this wide
    selection of objects. Download : Download high-res image (138KB) Download : Download

    augmentation process On our data set, only a small amount of data augmentation
    was used by manually cropping and rotating any images that were particularly rich
    in information; mostly in instances where both categories (such as a fish and
    a plastic bottle) were in one image; that image would then be split into two separate
    images, individually cropping the items. We started with 1318 photos, after augmentation
    was applied, our training set consisted of 1644 images and 100 images for the
    testing set. 4.3. Sorting data Our first task was to ensure a high-quality collection
    (Fig. 3). Poor quality images were therefore removed to benefit the system. (This
    process was subjective. In future research, we could use benchmarks based on a
    set of predefined parameters.) Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download

    Maria Shokouros-Oskarsson. Furthermore, imagery containing subject matter deemed
    irrelevant were also manually removed, to determine clear parameters and prevent
    confusion within the algorithm. In the case of our dataset, it was mostly the
    JAMSTEC sub marine machinery parts that were in the way, which was resolved by
    manually cropping the images. The biggest issue that arose was the strange (yet
    incredible) phenomenon of how much aquatic life had chosen to inhabit pollutants.
    An ethical dilemma therefore arises, as to not disturb the sensitive and delicate
    balance of the ecosystem, by removing these items (Fulton et al., 2019). We chose
    to remove any such images to prevent confusion when training the network architectures.
    From sorting the dataset, it was often questioned whether the Convolutional Neural
    Networks would be able to safely distinguish between very commonly confused items.
    For example, a jellyfish and a plastic bag closely resemble each other. There
    were also cases of starfish that we ourselves found difficult to distinguish whether
    they were real or plastic. Therefore, there is a very real danger that a neural
    network could make the same mistake. 4.4. Training a model for a binary classification
    task In this study, classes are defined as follows: an image which has man-made
    debris in it (‘Litter’ or ‘1’), or it has natural aquatic life in it (‘Animals’
    or ‘0’), this class can include plants or any variety of marine biology. For now,
    we chose not to use subclasses, in order to test this version first and see if
    it is successful. In further tests, a training set of multiple categories would
    be valuable to improve the detail and accuracy of the system. 4.5. Network architecture
    We chose convolutional neural networks as they can handle a large quantity of
    data and have a high-performance rate in the ever-developing machine learning
    industry. CNN algorithms are the strongest neural network for image recognition.
    The system learns to strategically, on different layers, detect the lines and
    edges in the input image. It is then able to distinguish between them, identifying
    segments of an image resulting in feature extraction. A major disadvantage to
    deep learning algorithms having many parameters, and the use of max pooling, is
    the higher risk of overfitting (Guo et al., 2016). As one of our models is an
    entirely new architecture with a brand new, untrained data set, it required a
    large amount of trial and error of adjusting the different parameters to avoid
    overfitting. To closely monitor the progress of the architecture, TensorBoard
    was used, so that we could frequently compare graphs on where overfitting was
    occurring and make appropriate adjustments. All images were resized, to a width
    and height of 140px, using Python to maintain a uniform size throughout all images
    and ensure that parts would not be cropped out. Additionally, 140px when tested,
    showed enough detail to recognize the shapes and patterns within the image but
    was not too high to slow down the run time. In the case of using such a vast variety
    of underwater debris and aquatic life, it was felt that the most information necessary
    should be used, even if it compromises speed; so, three channel values RGB were
    used, instead of one. To eliminate the issue of class imbalance, the data set
    has been split to have exactly 50 % of each category. Therefore, out of the 1644
    training images, 822 were in each category. An additional precaution taken, was
    to randomly shuffle the data, as the system would otherwise learn that the data
    is in order and again, guess accordingly. This system was created on a Dell Inspiron
    i7-7700HQ CPU 2.8GHz, 16GB RAM, 64-Bit with a Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics card,
    using Windows 10. The algorithm was programmed using Python in PyCharm and the
    specs of the system used were: Tensorflow, Keras and ReLU. Using cv2, we imported
    the collected and built a data set, created 2 × 2 windows, extracted the max pooling
    value and used the Adam optimization. This resulted in the architecture having
    the following parameters: Three convolutional layers with 32 nodes and no dense
    layers, the second kernel size was reduced to a (2,2) window, the validation split
    had to be reduced to 0.1 and it ran 95 epochs. As shown in Fig. 4. We used the
    Rectified Linear activation Unit (ReLU) as the activation function and the last
    layer used the logistic sigmoid function to enable binary classification. The
    validation split is usually optimised at 20 % (0.2) of the set, however, this
    architecture would favour one of the classifications, if at this setting. Download

    diagram of simple CNN classifier. When the final architecture was confirmed, we
    ran it 10 times to take an average of the Training Loss and Training Accuracy
    shown in Table 1, intermittently between rerunning the architecture, we continued
    to run Tests against Training Images and Test Images, periodically testing for
    correct classification. To train the VGG-16 model, we imported the VGG model using
    Keras and then applied transfer learning from the ImageNet weights. We used softmax
    activation and only 2 dense layers to keep our model close to the framework that
    (Kylili et al., 2018) had promising results with. To train the model on our data
    set, we then ran 50 epochs on a model checkpoint function, so that the highest
    accuracy model would be saved. Table 1. Training result comparisons. CNN VGG-16

    and evaluation The original aim of this research was to test if we could successfully
    train a CNN framework to distinguish between underwater debris and aquatic life,
    safely and to an accuracy of at least 85 %, as we collected a new database. The
    test results have shown that from a set of 100 tested images, 89 % were 13 correctly
    classified. When we ran evaluation metrics on this test (Fig. 5), we calculated
    a set of strong results such as 0.9 F1 score for ‘Animal’ detection and 0.88 F1
    score for ‘Litter’, as shown in Table 2. When running a 95 % confidence interval
    on our results, we found that the classification error of the model is 86 % ±
    0.061. Given these results, the true classification error of the model is between
    80 % and 92 %. Download : Download high-res image (34KB) Download : Download full-size

    0.89 0.89 100 The obtained result shows promising signs of being able to adapt
    to a much larger scale database, with more detail and a stronger CNN architecture.
    Furthermore, we compared our simple CNN model with the VGG-16 architecture by
    training our dataset onto the framework and using transfer learning and the final
    output layer of softmax (as suggested by Kylili et al., 2018) (Fig. 6). Our train
    had a loss of 0.0093 and accuracy of 1.0000, with test results achieving a 95
    % accuracy in predictions. Also shown in Table 3 the VGG-16 model achieved an
    F1 score of 0.95 for both categories, additionally the classification error is
    95 % ± 0.043. Therefore, the true classification of the model is between 91 %
    and 99 %. This shows promising signs that CNN models can be used to successfully
    classify all types of debris without disturbing marine life, particularly when
    using transfer learning on VGG-16. Overall, we conclude that transfer learning
    with a VGG-16 framework is more accurate and though these are our initial findings;
    with a larger data set and finer tuned parameters, we could have very positive
    results. Download : Download high-res image (34KB) Download : Download full-size

    underwater images of debris proved particularly difficult, and the images that
    were donated to us were not already labelled, so we had to complete this manually,
    which was time consuming. We also found similar challenges with de Vries et al.
    (2021), that many images were not of a high enough quality, consequently reducing
    our database to a size that was not suitable for CNN training. However, after
    the use of data augmentation, we were successfully able to create a new database
    that had a high accuracy level. From here we believe this research is therefore,
    a strong preliminary methodology for future research in this field with a larger
    database and a more powerful solution that can allow further depth and contain
    more classification groups. As mentioned previously, other papers have strived
    to identify marine debris using neural networks and have encountered relevant
    challenges. Similarly to our paper, Fulton et al. (2019)''s study produced their
    own dataset, which heavily drew from JAMSTEC''s imagery and far outweighed our
    own as it consisted of 5720 images. They had a trinary classification of plastics,
    man-made debris and other bio matter, their separation of classifications is close
    to our binary system and can be quite fairly compared. Much like ours, their dataset
    was designed to challenge the deep learning algorithm to maintain an accurate
    representation of a real-life scenario. We followed in similar footsteps by trying
    to vary our data as greatly as we could. Though this reduces the performance as
    Fulton et al. (2019) mentioned; it is “a better evaluation of what the detector''s
    performance would be in the field”, to which the authors of this study concur
    with. Their study produced promising results by comparing four different models;
    though they looked into object detection, whereas our paper compares image recognition
    models. With object detection; (including transfer learning on YOLOv2); their
    strongest results were using Faster-RCNN which detected plastics at an average
    precision rate of 83.3 %. de Vries et al. (2021) were able to capture their own
    dataset of over 18,000 images of floating debris and chose to compare object detection
    results of YOLOv2 with Faster-RCNN; yet they concluded that YOLOv2 obtained stronger
    results. However, their study only focused on surface level debris, so their database
    would have been far less complex for the neural network to predict. Other studies
    looked into using image recognition on surface level marine debris such as Kylili
    et al. (2018), who also produced their own dataset (12,000 images) and used VGG-16
    transfer learning which concluded in strong test results of 99 % and a validation
    accuracy of 86 %. It is interesting to note that their paper focuses on three
    specific categories of litter, whereas our study consists of much broader and
    less focused classifications; including data affected by degradation, wear and
    visibility, therefore as expected, our study should be producing less accurate
    results. When comparing with relevant neural network studies, the authors of this
    paper strongly believe that, when introduced to a larger dataset, the use of image
    recognition methods such as VGG-16, underwater to detect marine debris will perform
    very positively. This research is unique in its type; that it is one of the first
    papers that not only is looking for a feasible solution for our polluted water
    crisis but also has an emphasis on the perspective of animal welfare and ecological
    conservation. Additionally, our paper has reported some insight into progressive
    steps that using CNNs could successfully distinguish between any debris and any
    marine fauna. The paper has therefore, collated a large quantity of thoroughly
    thought-out scenarios and information that future papers will hopefully prioritise
    their studies and development with. 6. Conclusions and recommendations This research
    sets out to answer the question: can deep learning successfully distinguish between
    marine life and man-made debris underwater? From the research we conducted, the
    authors believe that with a larger data set, the possibility of using image recognition
    to safely remove debris underwater without disrupting aquatic ecosystems is strong.
    Fulton et al. (2019) quite rightly expressed concern about using image recognition
    underwater with the vast variety of debris available, however we have proven that
    subclasses are possible to use as a base to start with, and with future development
    on this research, we believe this could develop into a working large-scale prototype.
    While this research scratches the surface of potentially using artificial intelligence
    to distinguish successfully and safely between life and man-made debris; there
    are plenty of other factors that should be considered and researched moving forward.
    Our paper has been unique by comparing the effects of trained CNNs on a wide variety
    of categories, as opposed to three or four groups of objects. In particular, we
    have taken our study below the surface to detect debris and marine fauna underwater,
    as well as training the models to distinguish between the two. Although part of
    the novelty of this research was the diversity of data in its nature of depth,
    geographic location, and sea conditions, it did not cover a wide enough variety
    and would need to comprise of a database that includes these variables or considers
    fresh waterways and the aquatic life that lives there. Additionally, these algorithms
    were only trained on matter that exceeded the size of micro plastics (micro plastics
    are <5 mm). Therefore, it remains untested on any debris or living creatures under
    that size. Future research should be tested for image segmentation (or retest
    object detection) to ensure that biological entities (such as plants or animals)
    attached onto debris, are not categorised as litter. Other variables would be
    to diversify the nature of species of all underwater creatures, such as how would
    this algorithm specifically respond to stingrays embedded within the sand or coral
    with plastic wrapped on it. Additionally, an entire classification could be dedicated
    to entangled sea creatures and plants, which if applied to automation could be
    used to alert users to the finding of an endangered life. Further considerations
    include asking if it would be able to handle more complex situations? Such as
    accurately pinpointing floating plastic in a sea of jellyfish. Although de Vries
    et al. (2021) at Ocean Cleanup are doing a fantastic job of mapping patches of
    debris within the gyre, could we test our method on retrieving large quantities
    of underwater debris without picking up small life within something as vast and
    compact as the Great Garbage Reef? It would also be valuable for the algorithms
    to be combined with unsupervised learning using positive and negative reinforcement,
    so that they constantly train themselves and continue to improve their accuracy.

    \ In the past few decades, many non-invasive monitoring methods have been developed\n\
    based on body acoustics to investigate a wide range of medical conditions, including\
    \ cardiovascular\ndiseases, respiratory problems, nervous system disorders, and\
    \ gastrointestinal tract diseases. Recent\nadvances in sensing technologies and\
    \ computational resources have given a further boost to the\ninterest in the development\
    \ of acoustic-based diagnostic solutions. In these methods, the acoustic\nsignals\
    \ are usually recorded by acoustic sensors, such as microphones and accelerometers,\
    \ and are\nanalyzed using various signal processing, machine learning, and computational\
    \ methods. This paper\nreviews the advances in these areas to shed light on the\
    \ state-of-the-art, evaluate the major challenges,\nand discuss future directions.\
    \ This review suggests that rigorous data analysis and physiological\nunderstandings\
    \ can eventually convert these acoustic-based research investigations into novel\
    \ health\nmonitoring and point-of-care solutions.\nKeywords: body acoustics; disease\

    \ Introduction\nHuman body organs and mechanisms generate acoustic signals, including\
    \ sounds\nand vibrations, that propagate through the surrounding tissues and reach\
    \ the body surface.\nOn the body surface, these signals can be measured and monitored\
    \ noninvasively by\nacoustic sensors such as microphones, accelerometers, and\
    \ gyroscopes. They can contain\ninformation about the normal or abnormal activity\
    \ of their sources, i.e., the organs or\nmechanisms that generated them. For instance,\
    \ cardiovascular or respiratory-induced\nsounds can be monitored using a stethoscope\
    \ on the chest’s surface [1]. Any cardiovascular\nor respiratory abnormalities\
    \ may alter these sounds on the chest, e.g., by changing the\nsound signals at\
    \ their origin or the material properties of the tissues that the signals pass\n\
    through. The variations of these signals can be investigated in order to detect\
    \ and identify\nthe abnormality (Figure 1). Advancements in wearables and sensing\
    \ technology, coupled\nwith the developments in computing, signal processing,\
    \ and machine learning methods\nhave enabled the long-term, real-time measurement\
    \ and analysis of these signals even\noutside of healthcare facilities, which\
    \ may result in the earlier diagnosis of diseases and the\ntimely referral of\
    \ the patients to their caregivers.\nThis paper reviews the diagnosis and monitoring\
    \ methods that are being developed\nbased on body acoustics for different types\

    \ Diseases\nOne in every four Americans dies due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)\
    \ every year,\nwhich makes CVDs the leading cause of death in the United States\
    \ [2]. The earlier detection\nof the potential signs of the disease would make\
    \ early treatments possible, and may prevent\nsubsequent cardiovascular complications\
    \ [3]. Despite many efforts, the development of\nnovel robust diagnosis methods\
    \ is still an urgent need for the earlier detection of many types\nof CVDs. This\
    \ may become possible through the more-frequent evaluation of the patient’s\n\
    status, for example, by low-cost user-friendly remote monitoring methods that\
    \ can be used\noutside of the healthcare facilities. The current commercial remote\
    \ monitoring devices\nare mainly based on electrocardiography (ECG). However,\
    \ some CVDs such as structural\nabnormalities in heart valves may not be clearly\
    \ seen in the ECG signal because they do\nnot change the electrical depolarization\
    \ of the myocardium [4]. In the research setting,\nother methods such as cardiovascular-induced\
    \ sounds and vibrations on the chest’s surface\nhave been also widely investigated\
    \ [5–7]. These signals provide information about the\nmechanical aspects of cardiovascular\
    \ activity, and thus may contain diagnostic information\nthat is complementary\
    \ to the existing methods such as ECG.\nAfter these signals are measured using\
    \ the sensing systems, they are usually analyzed\nusing feature extraction and\
    \ machine learning methods to classify them into healthy and\ndiseased groups.\
    \ For example, the temporal and spectral contents of cardiovascular sounds\nBioengineering\
    \ 2022, 9, 149\n3 of 17\nhave been explored by methods such as wavelet transform,\
    \ power spectral density, and\nmel-frequency cepstrum [8–11]. The extraction of\
    \ the time and frequency features of the\nheart vibrations has been performed\
    \ through short-time Fourier transformation, wavelet\ntransformation, Wigner-Ville\
    \ distribution, and polynomial chirplet transformation [12–15].\nThe acoustic\
    \ signals can be also decomposed into their components using methods such\nas\
    \ ensemble empirical mode decomposition and variational mode decomposition [16,17].\n\
    Additional features can be extracted from the resulting modes, or these modes\
    \ can serve\nas signal features themselves. These decomposition methods can also\
    \ assist with signal\nﬁltration by excluding the modes which are believed to be\
    \ related to noise. Furthermore,\nsome studies have suggested that the inclusion\
    \ of respiration information would organize\nthe signal features into separate\
    \ groups that could lead to the more accurate classiﬁcation\nof heart vibrations\
    \ into normal and abnormal groups [18–23]. Throughout the different\nphases of\
    \ the respiration cycle, there is variation in the temporal and spectral characteristics\n\
    of heart-induced vibrations. For example, after segmenting vibration signals into\
    \ smaller\nsegments where each one represents one cardiac cycle, the segments\
    \ that occur during\nthe high-lung-volume phase are different from those during\
    \ the low-lung-volume phase\nin both the time and frequency domains. This suggests\
    \ that breaking the heart vibration\nsignals into two different groups based on\
    \ the respiration cycle information can result in a\nbetter signal characterization\
    \ [19]. Other popular signal processing and analysis methods\nof the cardiovascular-induced\
    \ sound and vibration signals have been reviewed in previous\nwork [5,6,24–26].\n\
    In recent studies, cardiovascular vibrations played a vital role in the development\
    \ of\nmethods for the monitoring of cardiovascular activity and the early detection\
    \ of irregulari-\nties. The axial and torsional components of these vibrations\
    \ may be recorded noninvasively\non the chest surface using sensing systems that\
    \ include accelerometers and gyroscopes.\nThese axial and torsional vibrations\
    \ are called seismocardiograms (SCG) [27,28] and gy-\nrocardiograms (GCG) [29,30],\
    \ respectively. These precordial vibrations are generated by\ncardiac movements\
    \ such as heart contraction, the opening and closure of the heart valves,\nand\
    \ blood ﬂow momentum and turbulence [5,6]. SCG and GCG signals can be measured\n\
    from different locations on the chest. Some of the common measurement locations\
    \ include\nthe sternum, the right upper sternal border, and over the heart apex\
    \ [5]. Other popu-\nlar vibration-based cardiovascular activity monitoring methods\
    \ include ballistocardiogra-\nphy [31,32], vibrocardiography [33], kinocardiography\
    \ [34], and mechanocardiography [35].\nThese noninvasive cardiac-health monitoring\
    \ methods have a duality in their applications;\nspeciﬁcally, they have use in\
    \ a clinical setting as well as in the home.\nCardiac vibration signals can provide\
    \ information about the heart rate and cardiac\ncycle duration. Each cardiac cycle\
    \ is composed of two main segments: the systolic and\ndiastolic phases. In one\
    \ cycle, the systolic portion is usually shorter than the diastolic\nportion [36].\
    \ In addition, the duration of the cardiac cycle depends on the respiration\n\
    phase in which the cardiac cycle occurred [22]. The variations in the heart rate\
    \ can be\nmeasured from the cardiac cycle duration, which can be determined by\
    \ heart vibration\nsignals [22,37,38]. These variations are known as predictive\
    \ factors of different CVDs, such\nas sudden cardiac death [39]. Furthermore,\
    \ the temporal features of the heart activities\nsuch as cardiac time intervals\
    \ and ﬁducial points (e.g., the opening and closure time of the\ncardiac valves)\
    \ can be also determined and analyzed using heart vibration signals [40–42].\n\
    These measurements assist in providing insight into the functions of the heart.\
    \ For example,\na recent study estimated the cardiac time intervals from impedance\
    \ cardiography, PCG,\nand SCG [43]. The estimations of each method were compared\
    \ with the gold standard\nvalues that were measured by multimodal echocardiography.\
    \ The results suggested that\nSCG had a signiﬁcantly higher accuracy than the\
    \ other methods for the estimation of the\npre-ejection period and the total systolic\
    \ time.\nCardiovascular vibrations assisted in the diagnosis and monitoring of\
    \ different clinical\nconditions. Earlier studies have been conducted to measure\
    \ the heart motion of anes-\nthetized pigs during surgery using a three-axis accelerometer\
    \ [44]. The accelerometer\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n4 of 17\noutput was ﬁltered\
    \ at 1 Hz in order to retain the movements due to the heart beating and\nremove\
    \ the low-frequency respiration vibrations. The results suggested that accelerome-\n\
    ters could locate irregular patterns that may indicate heart circulation failure—a\
    \ sign of\nnumerous CVDs. In another early study on human subjects, the functioning\
    \ of the left\nventricle has been observed through signals derived from SCG in\
    \ order to detect myocardial\nischemia [45]. Alterations in cardiac muscle contractions\
    \ were noted and analyzed. The\nﬁndings were conclusive enough to be used to diagnose\
    \ patients with ischemia. More\nrecent studies have used cardiac vibrations to\
    \ diagnose medical conditions such as heart\nfailure [46,47], coronary artery\
    \ disease (CAD) [48], valvular disease [49], ischemia [50],\natrial ﬁbrillation\
    \ [50–52], atrial ﬂutter [53], aortic stenosis [54,55], and myocardial infarc-\n\
    tion [56]. Further uses of left ventricular monitoring using SCG have been also\
    \ proposed in\nareas such as cancer patients’ cardiotoxicity assessments [57].\n\
    Auscultation has also been used to monitor cardiac health and activity for many\n\
    years. Phonocardiography (PCG) is another common technique to record cardiovascular\n\
    acoustics using a traditional or digital stethoscope [10,26]. In addition to normal\
    \ heart\nsounds (S1 and S2), a PCG signal may contain components that indicate\
    \ pathological\nconditions. For example, the presence of a third heart sound,\
    \ S3, which occurs right after\nS2, can be a sign of congestive cardiac failure\
    \ [58]. Figure 2 shows ﬁve sample normal\nand abnormal PCG signals. The presence\
    \ of a cardiovascular abnormality or malfunction\nsuch as an aneurysm or stenosis\
    \ may create turbulence in the downstream blood ﬂow in a\nvessel [59,60]. The\
    \ turbulent ﬂow generates sounds in speciﬁc frequency bands (depending\non the\
    \ morphology and severity of the abnormality) that transmit to the vessel wall,\
    \ then\nto the surrounding tissues, and eventually to the body surface. These\
    \ variations may\nthen be analyzed using signal processing and machine learning\
    \ methods to detect the\nabnormality. For example, CAD is caused by large amounts\
    \ of plaque deposit buildup in\nthe coronary arteries, which limits blood ﬂow.\
    \ Currently, the most accurate way to test for\nCAD is coronary angiography, which\
    \ is both invasive and expensive. Non-invasive ways\nto detect CAD include low-cost\
    \ methods that are based on the non-invasive measurement\nof heart sounds using\
    \ digital stethoscopes [61]. In order to diagnose CAD, one study\nobtained the\
    \ diastolic sound segments by stethoscope in CAD patients and analyzed them\n\
    using a multivariate classiﬁer [61,62]. Subtle differences were noted between\
    \ the diastolic\nsound from healthy individuals and patients with CAD, which suggested\
    \ that a digital\nstethoscope has potential for noninvasive CAD diagnosis.\nComputational\
    \ ﬂuid dynamics and post-processing numerical techniques are other ef-\nfective,\
    \ noninvasive approaches to analyze the sounds emitted from the human body [63,64].\n\
    Acoustic pressure ﬂuctuations have been recognized as the primary ﬂow-induced\
    \ source of\nthe sound through arteries and lung airways. These pressure ﬂuctuations\
    \ can be further\nexcited by blood ﬂow turbulence due to medical conditions such\
    \ as stenosis and aneurysm.\nThe pressure ﬂuctuations are correlated with highly\
    \ turbulent shear stresses and vibration\non the internal arterial wall leading\
    \ to the structural response of the surrounding tissue.\nComputational ﬂuid dynamics\
    \ simulations can investigate the sounds coming from highly\nturbulent ﬂuctuating\
    \ ﬂow through the arteries, and explain the mechanisms of the clinical\nobservations.\
    \ This provides information that can help predict a variety of cardiovascular\n\
    diseases [59,60]. In the past studies, vessel wall shear stress and pressure were\
    \ used as\nindicators of an unhealthy artery with a high potential risk of complications\
    \ leading to\nabnormal sound signals propagated through the tissue [65–70]. In\
    \ these studies, adverse\nhemodynamic conditions at critical times during a heart\
    \ cycle were investigated to ﬁnd\nthe correlation of transient pressure ﬂuctuations\
    \ due to highly turbulent kinetic energy\nwith structural vibrations and stresses\
    \ associated with elevated risk of hemolysis, platelet\nactivation, and potential\
    \ development of thrombosis. It was concluded that the highest tur-\nbulent stresses\
    \ through an unhealthy artery can be 4–14% higher than the stresses through\n\
    a healthy artery at peak systole. Moreover, the results from the pressure ﬂuctuations\
    \ and\nstresses on the internal arterial wall were utilized to analyze structural\
    \ vibrations in the\nfrequency domain, and to understand the mechanism of sound\

    \ the time-varying ﬂow ﬁeld into spatial\nand temporal parts through proper orthogonal\
    \ decomposition (POD) can also help provide\ninsights into the acoustic sources\
    \ in the ﬂow [59,60]. The decomposed time-varying ﬂow\ncan be reconstructed to\

    \ methods such as the POD has\nbeen highlighted in previous studies. For example,\
    \ it is suggested that POD can recon-\nstruct features of complex recirculating\
    \ ﬂows through small vessels [71], while the spatial\nresolution of 4D-ﬂow MRI\
    \ is not sufﬁcient to resolve these ﬂow features accurately [72].\nPOD has also\
    \ been used to study the ﬂow through mechanical aortic valves [73], cerebral\n\
    aneurysm [74,75], and coronary arteries [76].\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n6\

    \ procedures such as auscultation, percus-\nsion, and tactile fremitus have allowed\
    \ physicians to evaluate and address respiratory\nsystem diseases [77,78]. With\
    \ advances in sensing technologies and the aid of advanced\nsignal processing\
    \ techniques, the more reliable feature extraction and classiﬁcation of the\n\
    respiratory sounds and vibrations have been developed, leading to a better understanding\n\
    of both normal and abnormal lung acoustics. In order to classify signals that\
    \ differentiate\ndisease from health in a person, efﬁcient feature extraction\
    \ is needed. Different meth-\nods have been employed to properly extract features\
    \ from lung sounds and vibrations in\nthe time, frequency, and time–frequency\
    \ domains. Examples of these would be Fourier\ntransformation, mel-frequency cepstrum,\
    \ wavelet transformation, and Hilbert–Huang\ntransformation [77].\nVarious locations\
    \ on the body produce respiratory sounds which need different mea-\nsurement techniques\
    \ and devices. For example, airway impedance is measured from the\nlips [79].\
    \ In other applications, respiratory acoustics would be recorded from the neck\
    \ or\nchest surface. When the signals are measured on the neck (e.g., at the suprasternal\
    \ notch\nover the extrathoracic trachea), they present larger amplitudes than\
    \ recordings from the\nchest [80–82]. Measurements from the neck cover frequencies\
    \ from 80 Hz to 1500 Hz, which\nincludes the frequency range of many diseases\
    \ (Table 1). In general, the frequency range\nof interest for the analysis of\
    \ lung sounds is 100–2000 Hz. Because the chest behaves as a\nlow-pass ﬁlter,\
    \ it hinders higher-frequency components [77]. The frequency components\nbelow\
    \ 100 Hz are also usually eliminated in order to remove the acoustic signals from\
    \ other\nsources such as the heart, muscles, and electrical inference.\nTable\

    \ pulmonary disorder\n233–311 [85]\nPneumothorax\n400–600 [86]\nAcoustic signals\
    \ have been used to study the respiratory system in health and disease.\nFor example,\
    \ vibration response imaging (VRI) revealed variations in respiratory-induced\n\
    vibrations between smoker and non-smoker individuals in healthy asymptomatic sub-\n\
    jects [87]. VRI is a 2D grayscale imaging technique that measures respiratory\
    \ acoustic\nvariations using an array of piezo-acoustic sensors on the body’s\
    \ surface [88]. Further-\nmore, a wide range of acoustic-based methods have been\
    \ investigated and developed to\ndetect respiratory conditions including asthma\
    \ [1,89–94], obstructive sleep apnea [95–97],\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disorder\
    \ [1,93,98–101], tracheal stenosis [102], pneumoth-\norax [86,103–105], pneumonia\
    \ [1,106–108], pleural effusion [109], cystic ﬁbrosis [110,111],\nand COVID-19\
    \ [112,113]. Some of these methods and medical conditions will be discussed\n\
    in more detail in the rest of this section.\nSpirometry is currently one of the\
    \ most common procedures which is performed to\nevaluate pulmonary function [114].\
    \ This test utilizes sound waves that come from the\npatient’s breathing patterns\
    \ to diagnose respiratory diseases. During this procedure, the\npatient breathes\
    \ deeply and slowly into a mouthpiece that is connected to a spirometer. This\n\
    technique, however, can be limited by the patient’s ability to perform the test\
    \ accurately,\nmaking it increasingly difﬁcult for elderly people and younger\
    \ children [77].\nDue to these limitations, there have been alternative methods\
    \ to diagnose children\nwith pulmonary medical conditions such as asthma. For\
    \ example, the forced oscillation\ntechnique uses tidal breathing, which requires\
    \ little effort from children. This technique\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n7\
    \ of 17\nrequires subjects to be in a seated position with straight backs and\
    \ neutral or extended\nneck positioning [115]. In addition to the subject’s positioning,\
    \ the cheeks and ﬂoor of\nthe mouth should be supported by another person or physician.\
    \ The forced oscillation\ntechnique is commonly tested using a mouthpiece that\
    \ features a bacterial ﬁlter and a nose\nclip-on. In order to detect asthma using\
    \ this technique, the system analyzes the relationship\nbetween the airﬂow and\
    \ airway pressure from a respiration cycle (respiratory resistance\nand reactance).\
    \ Another way to use bioacoustics to diagnose respiratory diseases is the use\n\
    of tracheal sounds [102], which can be proven in people who suffer from obstructive\
    \ sleep\napnea [116]. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing\
    \ is disrupted for\nlonger than ten seconds and at least ﬁve times per hour throughout\
    \ a single sleep period.\nIn this case, the tracheal sounds come from the surface\
    \ vibrations on the suprasternal\nnotch. Acoustic-based sensors are able to track\
    \ the pressure changes produced by the mass,\nelastance, and resistance of the\
    \ trachea [116]. These sensors are inserted into a protective\nplastic chamber\
    \ with a deep cuff. This creates an airtight space between the transducer\nand\
    \ the skin. Adhesive tape is also usually used to keep the sensor placed right\
    \ above the\nsuprasternal notch and ensure a good sensor–skin coupling.\nSleep\
    \ apnea is deﬁned as a condition where the airﬂow is reduced by more than 90%\n\
    for more than 10 s in an adult subject [117]. Different airﬂow techniques have\
    \ been used for\nthe diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in sleep laboratories\
    \ and clinics [118–120]. These\ntechniques included respiratory inductance plethysmography,\
    \ oronasal thermal airﬂow\nmeasurements, and nasal pressure measurements. One\
    \ study assessed the effectiveness\nof tracheal sound measurements in the detection\
    \ of apnea [118]. The results suggested\nthat tracheal sound measurements are\
    \ efﬁcient and reliable enough to accurately pick up\nand provide a noninvasive\
    \ way to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea. Furthermore, the\ntracheal sound signals\
    \ could detect apnea on occasions when it was missed by the other\ndiagnostic\
    \ techniques (Figure 3). Because apnea affects the oxygen delivery to different\n\
    organs, it causes a muscle metabolic reﬂex, which in turn affects the blood pressure\
    \ and\ncardiac contraction [119]. Based on this, it is suggested that maximum\
    \ expiratory apnea\nincreases the kinetic energy of the heart, which can be measured\
    \ using cardiac vibration\nsignals such as SCG and BCG [120].\nBioengineering\

    \ focuses on lung function by recognizing the relationship between the gas\nﬂow\
    \ in the lungs and the vibration energy. This process requires patients to be\
    \ seated facing\nthe VRI machine with multiple sensors placed on the back while\
    \ respiratory cycles are\nrecorded [77]. The placement of sensors varies from\
    \ study to study [123]. For example, one\nstudy used two V-array sensors placed\
    \ on the back, 1.5 cm above the mesoscapula [124].\nThey were positioned in parallel\
    \ from right to left, with 5 cm allocated for a spin on the\ntwo sides. There\
    \ were three to ﬁve, 12-s cycles of natural breathing that were recorded for\n\
    the acquisition of data. After testing 62 subjects, the drastic change (p < 0.001)\
    \ in the VRI\nimages before and after treatment proved that this new VRI technology\
    \ was successful in\nthe evaluation of curative effects for pneumonia.\nChronic\
    \ obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of illnesses with the poten-\n\
    tial to block airﬂow and create problems related to the ability to breathe [125].\
    \ It is currently\nthe third leading cause of death in the world [126]. One way\
    \ to diagnose COPD is using a\nstethoscope, the accuracy of which relies on there\
    \ being no human error in the dissection\nof the auscultations [1]. Newly developed\
    \ digital stethoscope increase the reliability in\ndiagnosis substantially [77].\
    \ By combing the conventional stethoscope with computerized\nsystems, the digital\
    \ stethoscope could produce an efﬁcient technique for the discovery of\ncommon\
    \ COPD conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis [127,128]. Other\n\
    studies have been carried out to test the accuracy of digital stethoscopes in\
    \ the diagno-\nsis of various respiratory illnesses [129]. However, these devices\
    \ may also capture the\nsurrounding noise signals, which should be carefully removed\
    \ [130].\nIn addition to the assessment of respiration acoustics using sensing\
    \ systems, numerical\nmodels have been used to investigate the sound transmission\
    \ and vibration propagation\nwithin the respiratory system [131]. Clinical investigations\
    \ of ﬂow through the lung airways\nare challenging because of the complex geometry\
    \ of lung airways, the transient nature\nof the airﬂow during the respiration\
    \ cycle, and difﬁculties in locating small obstructions\ninduced by the chronic\
    \ pulmonary diseases in the medical images [132,133]. Numerical\nmodels can provide\
    \ a comprehensive analysis of ﬂow, which can potentially help explain\nairﬂow\
    \ complications and support medical decision-making. This detailed information\n\
    may not, however, be obtained with in-vivo measurements. For example, Hu et al.\
    \ [132]\ndemonstrated an innovative noninvasive diagnostic method using computational\
    \ mod-\neling and neural network techniques to localize the small obstructions\
    \ in the peripheral\nlung based on the ﬂow velocity contour shifts. In another\
    \ study, the effects of different\nseverity levels of upper airway deformation\
    \ on the airﬂow structure were studied nu-\nmerically in order to show the existence\
    \ of turbulence ﬂow and an increase in the ﬂow\nﬂuctuations [134]. Although these\
    \ numerical models can provide detailed information on\nrespiratory ﬂow, they\
    \ are computationally expensive and usually require a few hours or\ndays of processing\
    \ time.\n4. Other Diseases\nBiomedical acoustics have been also used to develop\
    \ monitoring methods for other\nmedical conditions. For instance, the digestive\
    \ system generates sounds and vibrations that\ncan be used for diagnosis purposes.\
    \ Bowel sounds can be categorized into four typical types\nbased on their waveform\
    \ and frequency content [135]. These include single burst, multiple\nbursts, continuous\
    \ random sound, and harmonic sound types (Figure 4). Alternatively,\nconsidering\
    \ time-frequency features, abdominal sounds and vibrations can be classiﬁed\n\
    into two groups of intestinal bursts and regularly sustained sounds (short and\
    \ long duration\nsounds, respectively) as well as three sets of interfering noise,\
    \ including respiration, snoring,\nand motion-related noise sets [136,137]. Table\
    \ 2 lists the time and frequency signatures of\ndifferent types of bowel sounds.\
    \ Although some studies suggest that bowel sounds do\nBioengineering 2022, 9,\
    \ 149\n9 of 17\nnot provide clinically relevant information [138], other studies\
    \ have used the noninvasive\nmonitoring and analysis of stomach and bowel sounds\
    \ for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal\ntract diseases. These medical conditions\
    \ include abdominal conditions such as appendicitis,\nintestinal obstruction,\
    \ irritable bowel syndrome, inﬂammatory bowel disease, pyloric\nstenosis, postoperative\
    \ ileus, and cholecystitis [139–146]. Despite respiratory and cardiac\nacoustics,\

    \ also used to monitor the conditions of patients with nervous\ndisorders such\
    \ as Parkinson’s disease [148,149] and multiple sclerosis [150]. For exam-\nple,\
    \ accelerometers can evaluate the movement data of patients with multiple sclerosis,\
    \ a\nchronic neurological disease. These data can be then used to assess the daily\
    \ activities of\nthe patients and provide clinical feedback in order to manage\
    \ the symptoms of multiple\nsclerosis [150]. Tremor is the involuntary and rhythmic\
    \ oscillatory movements of a body\npart, and is a symptom of many disorders, including\
    \ cerebellar disease, peripheral neu-\nropathy, orthostatic tremor, and Parkinson’s\
    \ disease [151]. The frequency of the tremor\ncan range between 3 Hz (slow) and\
    \ 12 Hz (rapid). These frequencies and the amplitude\nof the tremor can be continuously\
    \ monitored using wearable accelerometers in order to\nevaluate the severity of\
    \ the disease [152]. Other studies have used acoustic signals for\nthe non-invasive\
    \ diagnosis and monitoring of other medical conditions, including voice\ndisorders\
    \ (e.g., phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction) [153,154], dysphagia [155–157], fetal\n\
    health and development [158], and cartilage-based conditions such as osteoarthritis\
    \ and\nchondromalacia [159,160].\nBioengineering 2022, 9, 149\n10 of 17\n5. Conclusions\
    \ and Future Directions\nAdvances in the development of lighter, cheaper, and\
    \ more sensitive and accurate\nsensors have resulted in a resurgence in research\
    \ on body acoustics for the non-invasive\ndiagnosis of different medical conditions.\
    \ In addition, the recent improvements in com-\nputational resources have made\
    \ the real-time continuous monitoring of the patients a\nreality inside and outside\
    \ of clinical settings [31,161,162]. These developments can lead\nto the formation\
    \ of large databases of body acoustics. The analysis of this big data using\n\
    methods such as deep learning may provide a better understanding of the body acoustics,\n\
    and may establish novel non-invasive diagnosis methods. These signals may also\
    \ provide\ncomplementary information to other monitoring methods. For example,\
    \ while an ECG test\nassesses the electrical activity of the heart, acoustic signals\
    \ such as sounds and vibrations\ncan provide a more in-depth understanding of\
    \ the mechanical activity of the cardiovascular\nsystem. This complementary information\
    \ can lead to the detection of early signs of CVDs.\nAcoustic signals may also\
    \ assist in the non-invasive localization of the abnormalities\ninside the body\
    \ [163]. Simultaneous measurements of acoustic signals from multiple\nlocations\
    \ on the body surface using sensor arrays can provide information on the 3D\n\
    location of the acoustic source (e.g., cardiovascular diseases or lung pathologies).\
    \ For\nexample, the location of heart valves may be estimated by the analysis\
    \ of the outputs of a\nmicrophone array [106,164].\nDespite the many studies on\
    \ the utility of acoustic signals for medical diagnosis, there\nare still open\
    \ questions and challenges that hinder the transformation of these research\n\
    studies into commercial products. One of the challenges in the use of acoustic\
    \ signals\nfor medical diagnosis is the presence of different noise sets in the\
    \ signal of interest. The\nacoustic signals that are recorded on the body’s surface\
    \ consist of sounds and vibrations\nfrom other sources that are not of interest.\
    \ For example, a fetal PCG is a mixture of acoustic\nsignals from the fetus, different\
    \ organs of the mother, and other external noises [158]. In\naddition, any fetal\
    \ movements can add an artifact to the fetal PCG. On the other hand,\nthe acoustic\
    \ signals recorded from a pregnant woman are contaminated by signals that\noriginated\
    \ from the fetus. Robust noise ﬁltration methods should be established in order\
    \ to\nisolate the signals of interest from noise.\nAnother challenge is that the\
    \ temporal and spectral contents of the acoustic signals\ndepend strongly on the\
    \ acquisition location. For example, heart-induced vibrations on\nthe chest’s\
    \ surface may change by 30% with a sensor location change of 1 cm [5]. Other\n\
    parameters such as the postural position and transmission medium (e.g., the amount\
    \ of\nsoft tissue between the signal source and the sensor) also affect the contents\
    \ of the acoustic\nsignals. In addition, these signals usually change from one\
    \ subject to another. Therefore,\nthe analysis methods should be developed such\
    \ that they are robust, inclusive, and accurate\nunder different conditions.\n\
    In conclusion, the utilization of new generations of sensing technologies in com-\n\
    bination with signal processing methods and rigorous experiments to understand\
    \ the\nphysiological genesis of the acoustic signals may translate them from a\
    \ research interest to\na powerful tool for the diagnosis of medical conditions.\n\

  analysis: "The paper provides a novel approach for homecare respiratory therapies.\
    \ One of its key aspects is \"Personal Health Records (PHR)\". It proposes the\
    \ implementation of a platform to record vital signs data from a patient's sensor.\
    \ This data gets stored in a NoSQL database, which is a suitable option for write-intensive\
    \ sensor data collection. This approach addresses the issue of managing large\
    \ data sizes, as NoSQL databases can outperform traditional relational databases\
    \ in such situations.\n\nThe paper takes a user-centered approach to design and\
    \ develop the system. It conducts semi-structured interviews and lean development\
    \ feedback cycles to gather insights from end-users and improve the system's usability\
    \ and functionality.\n\nThe key contributions of this paper are:\n\n1. A cloud-based\
    \ mobile system for homecare respiratory therapies that focuses on sharing data\
    \ among patients, caregivers, and medical teams.\n\n2. A User-centered design\
    \ approach involving end-users in the design and development process.\n\n3. Implementation\
    \ of a PHR system using a NoSQL database to manage large volumes of sensor data.\n\
    \n4. Positive feedback from patients and caregivers on the system's usability\
    \ and functionality.\n\nThe paper has several strengths. It provides a comprehensive\
    \ solution for homecare respiratory therapies, considering the needs of patients,\
    \ caregivers, and medical teams. The system is user-friendly, as it has been developed\
    \ with end-user input. The use of a NoSQL database for PHR ensures efficient data\
    \ management. \n\nHowever, there are some potential limitations of the paper:\n\
    \n1. The study is based on a small sample size of three patients and 40 caregivers,\
    \ which may limit the generalizability of the findings.\n2. The study was conducted\
    \ in a specific healthcare setting, and the results may not be applicable to other\
    \ settings.\n3. The paper doesn’t describe how the data is secured and protected,\
    \ which is a critical aspect of handling sensitive patient information.\n\nThe\
    \ paper offers a promising approach for homecare respiratory therapies, particularly\
    \ in terms of data management and user-centered design. It can serve as a foundation\
    \ for further research and development in this field."

    health problems in the world. Treatment for these kind of afflictions often take
    place at home, where the continuous care of a medical specialist is frequently
    beyond the economical means of the patient, therefore having to rely on informal
    caregivers (family, friends, etc.). Unfortunately, these treatments require a
    deep involvement on their part, which results in a heavy burden on the caregivers’
    routine and usually end up deteriorating their quality of life. In recent years,
    mHealth and eHealth applications have gained a wide interest in academia due to
    new capabilities enabled by the latest advancements in mobile technologies and
    wireless communication infrastructure. These innovations have resulted in several
    applications that have successfully managed to improve automatic patient monitoring
    and treatment and to bridge the distance between patients, caregivers and medical
    specialists. We therefore seek to move this trend forward by now pushing these
    capabilities into the field of respiratory therapies in order to assist patients
    with chronic respiratory diseases with their treatment, and to improve both their
    own and their caregivers’ quality of life. This paper presents a cloud-based mobile
    system to support and improve homecare for respiratory diseases. The platform
    described uses vital signs monitoring as a way of sharing data between hospitals,
    caregivers and patients. Using an iterative research approach and the user’s direct
    feedback, we show how mobile technologies can improve a respiratory therapy and
    a family’s quality of life. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res image

    guidelines 1. Introduction 1.1. Respiratory therapies at home High hospital costs
    and the comfort of home treatments are driving the global population to choose
    home therapies over hospitalization. Healthcare at home can range from general
    care to highly specialized services for managing chronic conditions. Patients
    suffering from chronic diseases are the ones who can receive the most benefits
    from such treatments. Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer,
    diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases, represent the most common causes of
    premature adult deaths in the world (they accounted for 35 out of an estimated
    58 million deaths from all causes in 2005) [1]. Chronic respiratory diseases encompass
    all chronic diseases that affect the airways and the other structures of the lungs.
    They include asthma, respiratory allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,
    occupational lung diseases, sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension. According
    to the World Health Organization, chronic respiratory diseases account for 6%
    of all yearly deaths and, in 2005, they represented around 4% of Disability-Adjusted
    Life Years (DALY), an indicator for the amount of years lived in poor health.
    Moreover, it is estimated that around 300 million people suffer from asthma or
    a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone, and around 90% of all COPD
    deaths occur in low and middle-income countries [2]. In order to treat chronic
    respiratory diseases, medical services and public health organizations offer Respiratory
    Therapy (RT) services that comprise a variety of interventions related to airway
    management and maintenance of lung health. Examples of such treatments include
    oxygen therapy, ventilation, tracheostomy care, medication management and teaching
    of inhaler usage techniques. Respiratory therapy services often require home visits
    in order for technicians to set up medical equipment and check on the patient.
    This type of homecare service began to emerge in Chile around the year 2000, with
    respiratory therapies and special programs focused on children and adolescents
    such as the SAVED and AVNI programs [3]. Based on the good results of these programs,
    in 2015 the Chilean Ministry of Health created the AVNIA program for noninvasive
    ventilation of adult patients [3]. Thanks to this program, interventions can be
    partially or fully reimbursed by the government depending on patient eligibility.
    These initiatives involve an active role of both formal and informal caregivers
    for proper treatment of the patients. While medical specialists are necessary
    for technical tasks such as calibrating ventilation machines, the role of the
    informal caregivers cannot be understated as they are paramount in assisting with
    daily life activities and providing emotional support. Studies also show that
    their presence increases adherence to medications and other medical recommendations
    [4]. Nevertheless, their involvement is usually so taxing that several informal
    caregivers end up experiencing a deteriorating quality of life [5], [6]. In some
    cases, it even results in increased stress and depression. Mobile healthcare (mHealth)
    and electronic healthcare (eHealth) have been proposed as an effective technology
    for improving patient monitoring for those living at home [7]. These technologies
    leverage network and communication infrastructures to bridge the distance between
    medical personnel, caregivers and patients. Furthermore, they enable access to
    real time vitals information and other medically relevant data, and may issue
    warnings when any of these values deviate from expected figures. There are multiple
    benefits to this approach. First, the availability of objective parameters at
    all times results in a greater engagement on the part of the patient to better
    take care of him or herself and better manage his or her condition. Indeed, several
    studies have shown that more informed patients can better take care of themselves
    and, through this, enjoy a higher quality of life while simultaneously depending
    less on others [8], [9]. Secondly, new opportunities have risen for caregivers,
    who are now able to remotely monitor their loved ones’ status and therefore endure
    a smaller impact on their lives. As such, mHealth and eHealth present themselves
    as viable alternatives for chronic respiratory disease healthcare with the added
    benefits of reduced caregiver involvement and reliable vitals analysis for opportune
    medical interventions, all of which result in better healthcare for the patient
    and an increased quality of life for him or her and his or her caregivers. In
    this paper, we describe the architecture of a new Cloud-based Mobile System (CMS)
    for assisting home healthcare for patients suffering from chronic respiratory
    diseases. In the development of this solution took special care to not only provide
    a reliable patient monitoring mechanism, but also to improve the quality of life
    of their informal caregivers. In order to ascertain this claim, we used the Impact
    on Family Scale (IFS) to quantify the platform’s effectiveness. This project is
    trying to take the first step in Chile towards understanding how we are able to
    improve quality of life not only for patients, but also for the family caregiver
    support network. The following sections describe common problems found during
    respiratory home treatment and related work in the field. Section 2 presents the
    research methodology and the proposed system, Section 3 shows the research results
    and patient testing experience, and finally, Section 4 presents conclusions and
    future work. 1.2. Caregivers at home All chronic respiratory diseases need permanent
    treatment; the most common ones include various oxygen therapies, tracheotomy
    and mechanical ventilation. Several problems can arise when providing these types
    of treatments at home, most of them related to the quality of life of a patient
    and caregivers. All home therapies require care, understood as the management
    and generation of resources for the daily maintenance of health and life and the
    daily provision of physical and emotional well-being. The care given at home must
    include several aspects: health, education, social protection, and labor policies.
    Such care includes everything that is related to helping others meet their basic
    needs, developing social skills and alleviating pain and suffering. Formal care
    is provided primarily by professionals and experts in different areas of health.
    The unpaid care provided by family, friends, neighbors, or relatives is called
    “informal” or “family” care. Informal care is provided at all ages and for a wide
    range of conditions and diseases. Several studies have shown the burden that informal
    caregivers bear, which can lead to depression and anxiety [5], [10], [6]. It is
    common that spouses acting as informal caregivers see their roles undefined and
    constantly changing [5], which generates a direct impact on their quality of life.
    Being an informal caregiver of a patient with COPD also leads to anxiety, depression,
    social isolation and a more strained relationship with the patient [10], [6].
    In these situations, the caregiver’s burden is a major determinant of the impact
    of caregiving and the well-being of the patient [6]. Some studies even report
    a significant relationship between hypoventilation symptoms and caregiver burden
    [11]. Caregivers do not always have the time or the skills needed to provide quality
    care. At the same time, they are a key factor in the patient’s treatment, quality
    of life and the feasibility of home care. This problem is where modern technology
    can make an impact. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) have been
    considered internationally as a strategy that strengthens the attention and care
    of long home treatments. They create support networks around patients and can
    provide and generate permanent interactions among patients with chronic diseases,
    their family caregivers and the health team [12]. The next section describes related
    work in the field and different approaches using technology. 1.3. Related work
    Telemedicine is the use of information technologies to provide health care at
    a distance. Telemedicine solutions often work hand in hand with Body Area Networks
    (BAN), wireless networks of wearable, usually non-invasive computing devices,
    that are constantly monitoring for relevant healthcare information (such as vital
    signs) and transmitting it to a hub. BANs are a key technology in helping individuals
    attain a more proactive and affordable healthcare. They enable individuals and
    caregivers to closely monitor changes in the patient’s status and provide opportune
    feedback to help maintain an optimal health status. When integrated with a telemedical
    system, a professional medical staff can then review this data and provide a more
    accurate diagnosis in case mishaps occur [13]. Several studies have shown that
    remote patient monitoring systems significantly contribute to the patient’s quality
    of life [14], [15]. They promote patient activation, self care and better disease
    management. Home-based telehealth and self-monitoring have also been used to reduce
    the incidence of hospitalizations and emergency department visits for people with
    COPD [16]. There has been a large growth in tele-monitoring techniques and preventive
    care for older adults [17], [18]. Most of these platforms focus their attention
    on specific diseases such as dementia, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. They provide
    active health care and alarms for critical patients. However, few of these systems
    offer the possibility to share the patient’s data in real time with families and
    caregivers; they are instead built as a tool for helping medical teams detect
    risky situations. Smartphones are playing an important role in remote patient
    monitoring solutions, as they can provide context-aware information [19]. These
    mobile devices serve audio, localization, movement and battery usage data that
    can be used to build specific algorithms such as activity recognition. Phones
    and tablets are widely used to communicate through server applications and act
    as hubs of information sent by sensors. Few platforms have been created to share
    data with third parties. Security and confidentiality are the main issues, and
    most related systems only give access to health data to doctors, nurses and medical
    professionals. Thilakanathan describes how a health platform can be used for secure
    monitoring and sharing in the cloud [20] and specifies key features like the ability
    to handle large data sizes and efficient user revocation. While many remote patient
    monitoring initiatives exist, these are mostly meant as pure medical tools and
    do not offer useful information for a patient’s support network. Most of them
    are meant for elderly care and specific diseases. Our proposal is focused on respiratory
    therapies and sharing the data among patients, caregivers, and a medical team.
    The next section describes the proposed system and the methodology followed to
    build it. 2. Materials and methods To solve the problematics described in Section
    1, we envisioned a platform that can store and distribute a patient’s respiratory
    data in real time among hospitals, families and caregivers. The following section
    describes the user-centered approach implemented in order to achieve this. 2.1.
    Research and development method One of the most important aspects of this research
    is to continuously incorporate input from the end users of the proposed system,
    in order to achieve true user-friendliness. Common monitoring platforms described
    in the previous sections are focused on providing medical information to doctors
    and professionals. To build a cloud-based system around patients we relied on
    User Centered Design (UCD) principles [21]. A UCD process requires an understanding
    of the target users, their tasks and environments. It incorporates user feedback
    by directly involving them during design and development [21]. Agile development
    and user-centered design are a natural fit [22]. Agile development assumes a close
    connection to users, and user-centered design assumes rapidly iterating designs
    with users. UCD principles have been used together with agile development successfully
    in other research projects [22], [23]. To further emphasize the user-centered
    approach, Lean development methodologies were adopted to identify, satisfy and
    test the system’s requirements. Lean software development originated from lean
    manufacturing and lean IT principles and practices, applied to the software development
    domain. Lean development is an agile software development approach that focuses
    on fast delivery and prototyping, while eliminating all waste during the process
    [24], [25]. Thus, the usage of this methodology is consistent with the context
    being worked on, since one of the most common problems with health related ICTs
    is having to consider the physiological and psychological needs of the end users
    [21]. The core of lean principles is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop (Fig.
    1). The first step is figuring out the problem that needs to be solved and then
    developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to begin the process of learning as
    quickly as possible. Once the MVP is established, the team can work on tuning
    the research project. This will involve measurement and learning and must include
    actionable metrics that can demonstrate cause and effect question. Download :

    agile software development: the lean feedback cycle. Prior to the lean feedback
    loop, semi-structured interviews were conducted to further ascertain the homecare
    problematic, and their results are described in Section 3. With the compiled information,
    our research completed the Build-Measure-Learn cycle three times. The following
    sections describe the main focus of each phase and the lessons learned. 2.1.1.
    First cycle In the first cycle, we built initial mockups as the initial version
    of the platform and tested them with the end-users. Semi-structured interviews
    were used to measure this first approach, identifying several key aspects regarding
    usability and system architecture, thus informing us of which features added the
    most value to end users. We identified blood oxygen saturation as a key health
    constant for respiratory therapies. Caregivers and family members in home scenarios
    constantly monitor this value, even when taking the patient outside his or her
    home. Homecare therapies normally employ large oximetry devices for monitoring
    the patient’s vital signs. The main disadvantages of these devices include: their
    size, poor battery life, limited ability to transmit data and lack of storage
    capacity. The interviews showed that keeping track of the patient’s oximetry data
    is an issue. All comments and feedback were analyzed and consolidated, resulting
    in the improvement and validation of the proposed mockups and core features. 2.1.2.
    Second cycle With the feedback gathered from the first cycle, our team moved on
    to focus on building and obtaining the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that
    would incorporate the core features we determined. We divided our platform into
    three main components: a back-end, a local monitoring mobile application and a
    set of embedded devices. Each component tackles a core feature we identified:
    the back-end provides scalability and data centralization, the mobile application
    provides the monitoring interfaces, and the embedded devices were used for data
    extraction. We tested the MVP with the patients using the same methodologies as
    the previous cycle. The core features were well received, specifically, the new
    wearable oximetry sensors made a big change. Usability and Bluetooth connection
    management were identified as issues, and were addressed in the third cycle. 2.1.3.
    Third cycle The second cycle taught us that users where having troubles setting
    up the sensor’s connection. The interviews also revealed that caregivers wanted
    to access the system’s information remotely from their phones and computers. The
    medical team also identified the need to generate weekly reports from the platform,
    specifically to analyze the patients blood oxygen levels during their sleep. The
    mobile application had its interface simplified to ease the setup process of Bluetooth
    connections. Two new components were added to the platform: a front-end web application
    and a remote monitoring mobile application. Both components had their graphical
    interfaces built together with caregivers in order to achieve maximum usability.
    During this third cycle we also worked with pediatric patients, for which a modified
    version of the previously used wearable oximetry sensor was implemented in order
    to better accommodate the children’s needs. 2.2. Architecture of the proposed
    cloud-based mobile system The platform’s architecture is based on the computing
    model called Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC). Following MCC, both the data storage
    and data processing in mobile technologies can be performed outside of the device
    if necessary [26]. In our case we identified a Cloud-based Mobile System (CMS)
    as the best architecture approach in order to address the challenge of implementing
    a homecare service through mobile devices. A CMS can improve collaboration among
    the patient, his or her caregivers and the medial team for better home care [27].
    The proposed platform aims to provide help to the patient’s informal caregivers
    and support network. Fig. 2 shows the general architecture of the CMS, separating
    its functionality into three basic concerns: (a) cloud-based backend services
    for computation and data storage, (b) mobile and web applications to enhance collaboration
    and analysis among patients, caregivers, and medical providers and (c) embedded
    and mobile applications to support the vital signs monitoring and improve the
    communication channel in the family caregiver support network. The basic sequence
    flow starts when adding a new patient to the system, where multiple users can
    get the patient’s information locally or remotely (see Fig. 3). The backend behind
    the platform gathers the data from sensors used by patients and builds Personal
    Health Records (PHR) for each user. Download : Download high-res image (132KB)

    mobile system. Download : Download high-res image (102KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Sequence diagram showing flow of communication between
    the different components of the architecture. The backend services powering our
    CMS were built on top of several technologies. The backend service layer provides
    authentication and security for each sensor data entry, fires alarms when a risky
    situation is detected and notifies all users with access to the information. A
    NoSQL database is used to store patient data. Sensor data collection is naturally
    write-intensive, and it is known that NoSQL solutions can outperform traditional
    relational database systems in these situations [28]. The backend services and
    NoSQL databases are hosted on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform. The backend service
    needs to distribute data to several users (medical experts and caregivers) and
    through several platforms (mobile and web). We opted to use the PubNub push service
    that combines multiple technologies in a single service. PubNub has been used
    effectively in various research applications [29]. 2.3. Frontend web application
    The web application is targeted towards medical teams and experts for continuous
    monitoring. The frontend component focuses on displaying three key pieces of information:
    the most recent oxygen saturation value (the percentage of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin
    relative to total hemoglobin in the blood), the most recent heart rate (measured
    in beats per minute) and the patient’s connection to the sensor (connected or
    disconnected). After the second lean development feedback cycle, a reports module
    was added to the frontend. This reports module generates weekly reports on each
    patient detailing all the data points captured and general risk statistics such
    as alerts and low oxygen values. These reports are comparable to the SpO2 portion
    of a polysomnography sleep study. The main advantage over this type of study is
    that the system contains data from multiple nights, without requiring hospital
    resources. Fig. 4b shows a screenshot of a report and the patient’s SpO2 values.

    Fig. 4. Remote monitoring applications. (a) Web real-time monitoring interface.
    (b) Web weekly reports and analysis. (c) Mobile remote spot check application.
    The frontend has its own alerts system independent from the monitoring apps managed
    by the backend, which displays pre-configured alerts when a patient’s vital signs
    values leave their normal bounds. The alerts are displayed in the top right corner
    of the interface and generate a set of events on the patient’s timeline. This
    creates historical records that are stored in the platform for further analysis.
    A common situation in which this feature is especially useful is when diagnosing
    and treating sleep apnea syndromes. Fig. 4a shows a screenshot of the monitoring
    interface. The latest heart rate and oxygen saturation values can be seen on the
    right side, while in the middle the application displays the data captured within
    the last hour, with past values accessible by scrolling. In the top right corner
    the user can access the latest alerts. When a user has the correct access rights,
    more options appear on the left bar, for example, options for managing other users.
    2.4. Mobile monitoring applications The monitoring apps provide a virtual space
    where patients, caregivers, and medical providers share information and visualize
    data in different ways. The cloud system presents two specialized interfaces for
    delivering the patient’s vital signs data to the user’s phone: a local monitoring
    Android app and a remote monitoring cross-platform app. 2.4.1. Local monitoring
    hub Local monitoring takes place when the user is fewer than 15 m away from the
    patient in an indoor scenario. The application connects directly with a sensor
    the patient is using via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It displays the sensor’s
    data values with a delay of less than a second without requiring an active Internet
    connection. This application works as a key stone in the entire system, also sending
    the sensor data to the cloud system using a Wi-Fi network. The local monitoring
    hub is built natively on the Android platform and requires a device running Android
    4.0 or more for the use of BLE. The application was designed to support multiple
    sensors through BLE GATT specifications. The local monitoring hub can be used
    in tablets and phones through Wi-Fi or cellular data Internet connections. This
    enables constant patient monitoring out of their homes. Besides displaying sensor
    data, the mobile application is designed to act as a communication channel between
    the caregiver, the medical team and the patient’s support network. The main features
    of the Android app include: SpO2 & heart rate monitoring, emergency alerts system,
    communication with a medical team, cloud backend data synchronization and initial
    patient setup via QR scanning. The initial version of this component was developed
    during the second feedback cycle. With the feedback gathered from caregivers,
    considerable changes were made to the app between the second and third cycles.
    Bluetooth management was improved with a red and green button, the pulse chart
    was removed to simplify the interface and an alerts system was added. Fig. 5 shows
    a screenshot of the application’s most recent user interface. The top bar displays
    two buttons. The left button manages sensor discovery and connection via BLE,
    while the right button manages connection with the cloud-based backend. Both of
    these buttons are green if the app is working correctly and turn red if there
    is a problem with the device connection or the Wi-Fi network. These buttons are
    designed in such a way that with a quick glance a user can detect and fix any
    malfunction of the app. Download : Download high-res image (65KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Local vital signs monitoring user interface. 2.4.2. Remote
    monitoring Remote monitoring using a mobile phone takes place when a user wants
    to access the patient’s vital signs from a remote location. A normal situation
    in which this happens is when family members are away from home working and want
    to know about their patient’s health status. The system’s remote mobile application
    aims to enable other members of the patient’s support network to monitor vital
    signs and receive risk alerts. The interface is focused on displaying the patient’s
    current heart rate, oxygen saturation and connection status. In contrast to the
    web application, this is meant for spot checks rather than constant monitoring.
    It is designed to show the current status of a patient with a quick look at the
    interface. This application gathers data from the cloud-based backend through
    normal HTTP calls and connects directly with the PubNub servers. This way, the
    app will get updates from the patient in real-time without overloading the main
    servers. The backend also provides the security layer for the remote monitoring
    app. Fig. 4c shows a screenshot of the mobile application displaying the sensor
    data. The screen displays the main interface and is designed to immediately display
    the most relevant information for spot checks. 2.5. Sensor platform and embedded
    applications The embedded application is designed to enhance the process of collecting
    data from wearable vital signs devices. The sensor device is directly linked to
    the local monitoring hub, sending the data input for the whole solution. The sensors
    supported by the platform can operate without other components of the cloud-based
    mobile system, acting independently. Blood oxygen saturation refers to the percentage
    of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin in the blood. Peripheral
    capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) is an estimation of the oxygen saturation level,
    usually measured with a pulse oximetry device. For RTs, the SpO2 level of a patient
    needs to be constantly monitored. Any drop in its normal value needs an intervention
    ranging from an adjustment in the mechanical respirator to an emergency transfer.

    Angel activity sensor. (c) BM2000A Bluetooth pulse oximeter. (d) 9pin disposable
    adhesive SpO2 probe. The sensor platform is built to support multiple models of
    pulse oximetry devices; they must measure the SpO2 levels and photoplethysmography
    (PPG) heart rate and use Bluetooth for communication. Preferably, these devices
    should use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and be designed for constant monitoring.
    The devices chosen for the research include BM2000A OLED wrist pulse oximeters,
    manufactured by Shanghai Berry Electronic Technology. These devices are used as
    wristbands that constantly monitor the patient’s vital signs. The BM2000A uses
    a rechargeable 3.7 V lithium battery, lasting around 24 h. Fig. 6b shows a picture
    of the Angel sensor, another device that can be used with the platform. The Angel
    device is an open sensor wristband that measure heart rate, skin temperature,
    SpO2 among other vital signs. The angel sensor has open access to the raw data
    captured via BLE. This wearable device was used in the initial lean cycles with
    patients. We had serious problems getting the right SpO2 measurements when used
    as wristband. The feedback was not positive, as the sensor was not suitable for
    continuous monitoring. Fig. 6c shows a picture of the BM2000A. It is 68 × 58 ×
    20 mm and can be used around the patient’s wrist. The sensor has an OLED display
    of SpO2, heart rate, pulse intensity and a plethysmogram. The following section
    describes how the sensor device was adapted for homecare testing. 2.5.1. Sensor
    probe adaptation for pediatric patients The factory BM2000A uses a plastic sensor
    probe, displayed in Fig. 6c. Initial testing with this sensor immediately triggered
    complaints from users. Specifically, pediatric patients found it uncomfortable
    and often removed the sensor during the night. Caregiver feedback also showed
    that the probe was easily dropped or removed by infant patients, and could not
    replace their previous equipment. To solve this, the BM2000A was adapted to use
    common 9pin disposable adhesive SpO2 probes (see Fig. 6d). Pediatric patients
    were used to these probes and they were thus well-received by them. Other than
    on the finger, the probe can also be used on the feet and ears. Since these probes
    used different pin-out specifications, an adapter was built to bridge the two
    interfaces. The adapter was constructed using a D-Subminiature DE9 module. A power
    usage test was conducted using power monitoring hardware and power tool software
    from Monsoon Solutions Inc. Average power was measured during a 60 s time period
    using the original probe and the adapted probe. The results showed almost no difference
    in power usage: the original probe averaged a power consumption of 199.97 mW and
    the adapted probe 204.64 mW. The following section discusses the experimentation
    with real patients and shows the research results of the proposed cloud-based
    mobile system to support and improve homecare for respiratory diseases. 3. Results
    Before developing the software, a descriptive analysis was conducted to demonstrate
    the burden of caregivers and family members of chronic respiratory patients. Section
    3.1 explains how the analysis was performed and its results. Section 3.2 describes
    the experimentation with patients and the data provided by the platform. 3.1.
    Patient analysis This research takes the definition of Family Quality of Life
    to be “conditions where the family’s needs are met, and family members enjoy their
    life together as a family and have the chance to do things which are important
    to them” [30]. The Impact on Family Scale (IFS) is a generic instrument that assesses
    the impact of chronic diseases on a family. It describes four factors: financial
    burden (4 items), family/social impact (9 items), personal impact (6 items), and
    impact on coping (5 items). Scores are set on a 4-point scale in which 1 represents
    major impact and four represents minor impact. The score is set by the algebraic
    sum of the answer given by the family caregivers globally and per item [31]. This
    project conducted a descriptive analysis of 40 families and their caregivers included
    in the home care and ventilator support program TEVEUK. Ltda. prior to our intervention.
    The inclusion criteria corresponded to those described for the AVNI and AVNIA
    programs [3]; the average age of patients in this program being 11.3 ± 4.7 years.
    The families have been included in the ventilator support program for an average
    of 7.1 ± 1.7 years. The IFS applied to the families resulted in 50.35 ± 9.5 global
    points. Analysis by factor showed a high relative impact of the financial burden
    (8.4 ± 2.5 points) and social burden (22.7 ± 6.3). A total impact score was calculated
    by averaging all scores; Fig. 7 shows a comparison between the four IFS factors
    and their total impact. Download : Download high-res image (59KB) Download : Download

    with patients The platform was tested on three patients, each one of them representing
    different situations, ages and chronic diseases where monitoring can help their
    support network. Patient 1 was 11 years old and suffered from a neuromuscular
    disorder and kyphoscoliosis. He used oxygen therapies from an early age and his
    mother and grandmother acted as informal caregivers. Patient 2 was 17 years old
    and was born with myelomeningocele and his main treatment was the use of mechanical
    ventilation. Patient 3 was 19 years old and suffered from obliterative bronchitis
    and muscular damage from birth. He used a wheelchair to move around and was constantly
    exercising. Patient 1 was not aware of his condition and completely dependent
    on his caregivers, needing help win daily activities such as eating and bathing.
    His oxygen therapy consisted of using a Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BPAP)
    device during his sleep. He had his blood oxygen saturation constantly monitored
    by the caregivers, even when they went out for a walk. His father worked far away
    from home and constantly called home to check on the patient. Patient 1 had a
    progressive disease, which means that his muscles are expected to slowly weaken
    over time and need complete mechanical ventilation. They had a stable Wi-Fi connection
    at home which was used by the platform. A picture of patient 1 using the platform
    can be seen in Fig. 8a. Download : Download high-res image (416KB) Download :

    has born with myelomeningocele and requires permanent mechanical ventilation through
    tracheostomy. (c) Patient 3 suffered from obliterative bronchitis and muscular
    damage from birth. Patient 2 was very active and aware of his disease; his mother
    accompanied him everywhere acting as his caregiver. His treatment consisted of
    permanent mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. They used a mobile ventilator
    which was carried around by the patient and his caregiver, taking it to school
    or any place where they needed to travel and attend. His father also worked far
    away from home and had knowledge of technological solutions. Patiant 2’s family
    also had a stable Wi-Fi connection. Fig. 8b shows a picture of patient 2 testing
    the platform. Patient 3 was also very active, but limited to his wheelchair. He
    had a daily routine and his sister and mother acted as caregivers. Unlike patient
    1, his disease is not progressive, however, he has the capacity of half a lung.
    His treatment consisted of BPAP support at night. He had trouble sleeping since
    he had a tendency to move around during his sleep, which instantly dropped his
    oxygen saturation. The patient also had a Wi-Fi connection and Fig. 8c shows a
    picture of patient 3 using the sensor during his sleep in order to on-line monitor
    his vital signs. These three patients represent common situations in homecare.
    Patients may can be active and move around like patients 2 and 3, or be stationary
    like patient 1. Caregivers also had different roles in each situation: patient
    1 needed assistance with all daily tasks while patient 2’s caregivers had to accompany
    him when leaving his house. Each patient needed constant SpO2 monitoring through
    pulse oximetry devices, had family members who wanted to check on them during
    the day and had access to Wi-Fi Internet connections. Each patient in the experiment
    had common pulse oximeters that could not be transported while unplugged. Initial
    reactions to the system were quite positive, and the BM2000A itself was very well
    received compared to the devices they were used to. The monitoring apps where
    also used remotely by caregivers and the system itself was capable of collecting
    SpO2 tendencies though the experiment. In this experiment, our medical team used
    the web application to regularly check on the patient. We used the real time information
    to help them detect and fix disconnections and to double-check if the patient
    had normal values for heart rate and oxygen saturation. The study with patients
    was carried out during a period of one month and they did not use the sensor at
    all times. For example, the device was removed during baths and meals. We asked
    the patients to use the platform during their sleep and their free time. Table
    1 shows a summary of the data generated during the experiment. Table 1. Data collected
    by the system. Empty Cell Patient 1 Patient 2 Patient 3 Data points per hour 96.23
    98.25 61.01 Avg. SpO2 93.84% 93.96% 96.86% Avg. pulse rate (BPM) 96.6 66.70 72.97
    SpO2 alarm value 88% 88% 90% % Below alarm value 6.14% 5.81% 0.76% The IFS survey
    was also given to the patient’s caregivers, producing similar results to the patient
    analysis conducted on 40 caregivers. The results showed an average of 47.71 ±
    7.2 global points. The financial and social burden factors had a high relative
    impact with 6.28 ± 1.9 and 22.57 ± 3.6 points respectively. Fig. 9a shows a photo
    of the local monitoring application installed on a Nexus 7 tablet. The tablet
    was kept close to the patient timewhile he was sleeping in order to prevent disconnections.
    This device was critical for the platform to function correctly since it acts
    as a bridge between sensor data and the cloud backend. Patients and caregivers
    where instructed to keep the tablet powered and connected to Wi-Fi at all times.

    Fig. 9. Devices caregivers used to monitor the patients vital signs. (a) The local
    monitoring hub. (b) The remote monitoring mobile app for caregivers. (c) Data
    captured from Patient 1 during his sleep. Fig. 9b shows a photo of a caregiver
    using the remote monitoring application. The app received good feedback from caregivers
    and its simple design helped them quickly obtain the information they needed remotely.
    On the other hand, Fig. 9c shows a sample of data captured by the system during
    a normal day. Blue dots display values of oxygen saturation over the alert range,
    while red dots display values below it. The data generated by the platform permitted
    us to analyze de-saturation periods at night, which were completely lost using
    common pulse oximeters. Table 1 shows a similar behavior in patient 1 and patient
    2, with their SpO2 values being under their respective alarm values 6% of the
    time. Causes for de-saturation can vary from simple movements to real emergencies
    and each patient can have their own specific complications. In this case patient
    3 behaved differently from the rest, as he used the platform for less time during
    the week. His oxygen saturation was below the alarm value around 0.76% of the
    time, indicating he does not suffer major de-saturation problems at night. The
    following section presents our general conclusions and topics for discussion.
    4. Discussion and conclusions Chronic respiratory diseases are a major cause of
    mortality in the world, but they can be treated and managed at home through respiratory
    therapies. This situation, however, results in a deterioration of the quality
    of life for caregivers around the patient. We propose a cloud-based mobile system
    to support and improve homecare for respiratory diseases. The platform is centered
    around vital signs monitoring, especially oxygen saturation through SpO2. This
    vital sign holds key information in treating the patient and can detect both the
    need for treatment adjustment as well as emergency situations. Through the use
    of mobile technologies and embedded systems we constantly monitor SpO2 and distribute
    the information to medical specialists, caregivers and the patient. This generates
    a collaborative system where everyone is taking care of the patient. One of the
    major strengths of the proposed platform is that its design is based around the
    patient and their support network, rather than being a pure medical tool for diagnosis.
    A CMS was chosen as the base architecture, where the mobile component is installed
    at the patient’s home. CMS can be a great approach to implement general homecare
    systems because mobile systems are in tune with the collaborative nature of homecare,
    where multiple actors are involved. Mobile devices make the system ubiquitous,
    while cloud computing helps overcome the limitations of mobile devices, as well
    as providing new development opportunities. Future work for this research includes
    incorporating machine learning techniques. Machine learning can be used to detect
    medical complications in various patients. SpO2 and heart rate data generated
    by the system, together with respiration rate and systolic blood pressure have
    been used successfully to detect patient deterioration using Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) [32]. The PPG heart rate data can also be used together with ridge linear
    regressions, multilayer neural networks, SVMs and random forests to estimate blood
    glucose and blood pressure [33]. The initial research conducted on patients and
    caregivers shows promise for a smooth adoption of the CMS and evidences the impact
    of RTs in family quality of life. The system was very well-received and actively
    used by families. The CMS can potentially replace the pulse oximetry devices currently
    used at home, bringing economic benefits. The setup used in the experimentation
    has a cost of roughly 285 USD (85 USD for the BM2000A and 200 USD for the Nexus
    7 2013 tablet), compared to current devices that can cost up to 1700 USD (Nellcor
    Bedside SpO2). Additionally, the experimentation costs may decrease if other types
    of mobile devices are used. This proposal specifically targets patients with respiratory
    problems, though it could be used for other chronic diseases at home. Furthermore,
    the CMS could potentially have an important impact on public health and healthcare
    costs through the implementation of specific disease prevention programs and through
    improved disease management programs. Conflict of interest The authors declare
    that there are no conflicts of interest. Acknowledgements This work was partially

  title: A cloud-based mobile system to improve respiratory therapy services at home
  verbatim_quote1: The backend services powering our CMS were built on top of several
    technologies. The backend service layer provides authentication and security for
    each sensor data entry, fires alarms when a risky situation is detected and notifies
    all users with access to the information. A NoSQL database is used to store patient
    data. Sensor data collection is naturally write-intensive, and it is known that
    NoSQL solutions can outperform traditional relational database systems in these
    situations [28].

    attributes assists in the estimation of maximum allowable depletion [139]. Soil
    moisture-based irrigation scheduling has the disadvantage that plant water uptake
    and stress are affected by soil moisture content and also inﬂuenced by environmental
    conditions, pests and diseases, root zone salinity, and nutrient availability.
    Variation in soil properties also affects irrigation scheduling, which necessitates
    soil testing at multiple points for accurate estimation of soil moisture content.'

    Abstract: Global drylands, covering about 41% of Earth’s surface and inhabited
    by 38% of the

    world’s population, are facing the stark challenges of water scarcity, low water
    productivity, and

    food insecurity. This paper highlights the major constraints to agricultural productivity,
    traditional

    irrigation scheduling methods, and associated challenges, efforts, and progress
    to enhance water

    use efﬁciency (WUE), conserve water, and guarantee food security by overviewing
    different smart

    irrigation approaches. Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods (based
    on weather,

    plant, and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important information needed
    for precise irrigation,

    which leads to over- or under-irrigation of ﬁelds. On the other hand, by using
    several factors,

    including soil and climate variation, soil properties, plant responses to water
    deﬁcits, and changes in

    weather factors, smart irrigation can drive better irrigation decisions that can
    help save water and

    increase yields. Various smart irrigation approaches, such as artiﬁcial intelligence
    and deep learning

    (artiﬁcial neural network, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent system,
    and deep learning),

    model predictive irrigation systems, variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology,
    and unmanned aerial

    vehicles (UAVs) could ensure high water use efﬁciency in water-scarce regions.
    These smart irrigation

    technologies can improve water management and accelerate the progress in achieving
    multiple

    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where no one gets left behind.

    1. Introduction

    Drylands (hyper-arid, arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid parts) occupy 41% of Earth’s

    surface, supporting 38% of global population [1,2]. Agriculture and pastoralism
    are the

    major livelihood sources for most of the population, largely dependent upon natural
    re-

    sources [3]. About 70% of the world’s drylands exist in developing countries where
    people

    are confronting the stark challenge of poverty, food insecurity, malnourishment,
    poor

    economic conditions, and marginalization [4,5]. Water availability and agricultural
    pro-

    ductivity are the most pressing issues associated with drylands and land degradation
    [6].

    Globally, water scarcity is already affecting 1–2 billion people, and a majority
    of them are

    concentrated in drylands, where the supply of water is insufﬁcient to meet the
    user de-

    mands [7]. Future climate projections also suggest that in coming decades more
    people will

    be facing huge shortages of water. Consequently, climate change and water management

    decisions will adversely affect drylands and their inhabitants [8]. As global
    population is

    increasing rapidly, agricultural productivity in drylands needs improvement to
    meet food

    security demands. Therefore, adopting smart irrigation approaches is a viable
    option to bet-

    ter utilize the available water resources and improve water productivity in drylands.

    scarcity has become one of the critical issues and threatens the sustainable development
    in

    drylands [9]. Water scarcity occurs when water demand becomes equal or even exceeds
    the

    total available fresh water resources [10]. Water scarcity should be considered
    from both

    physical and economic perspectives [11]. Physical water scarcity has two aspects:
    green

    water scarcity (soil moisture in root zone is insufﬁcient to meet crop water demands),
    and

    blue water scarcity (both surface and ground water availability is unable to meet
    human

    water needs) [12]. The economic water scarcity occurs when water resources are
    physically

    available, but lack of institutional capacity and socioeconomic conditions limit
    the use of

    that water [13]. Water scarcity negatively impacts social integrity and sustainable
    economic

    development, especially in drylands. The primary sector, which is seriously affected,
    is

    agriculture, utilizing more than 80% of total fresh water [14]. Intensiﬁcation
    of agricultural

    water scarcity could affect food production and threaten food security in drylands
    in the

    future [15]. Further, it may seriously impact the associated Sustainable Development
    Goals

    of SDG-2 (Zero hunger), SDG-6 (Clean water), SDG-7 (Clean and affordable energy),
    SDG

    15.3 (Desertiﬁcation control) and SDG-14 (Life below water), which are directly
    or indirectly

    dependent on water availability [16,17].

    Since the available water resources are limited and to obtain more yields with
    less

    water use, efﬁcient management of available water with improved water productivity

    is direly needed to meet future food demands [18]. Managing irrigation efﬁciently
    is

    challenging in drylands because there are so many factors to take into account,
    such as

    crop type, climate, soil type, and irrigation methods [19]. Drylands are characterized

    by high potential evapotranspiration, low and erratic rainfall and high temperature
    [20].

    Additionally, predicted extreme weather events due to climate change will further
    worsen

    the situation. Besides hostile environmental conditions, increasing water scarcity
    in these

    regions is posing serious threats to irrigated agriculture and sustained food
    production [16].

    Although agriculture consumes about 80% of the total water utilized in the agriculture

    sector globally [14], this irrigation generates a lower return per unit of water
    used than

    other economic sectors [21]. The use of traditional irrigation methods and low
    water use

    efﬁciency (35–40%) caused by poor management are major constraints to sustainable
    crop

    production in drylands [22,23]. Moreover, farmers in these regions still rely
    on traditional

    irrigation systems that manifest the lowest WUE. This situation puts enormous
    pressure on

    the agriculture sector to become more efﬁcient in irrigation water use and evoked
    the call for

    a “Blue Revolution” in water-limited agricultural regions “to produce more crop
    per drop

    of water.” Efﬁcient water-saving irrigation approaches, especially the application
    of smart

    irrigation systems, have the potential to meet this critical challenge in dryland
    productivity.

    A smart irrigation system applies water in the right amount, at the right time
    and place,

    in a ﬁeld [24]. Smart irrigation offers better irrigation decision-making by using
    several

    factors, including soil and climate variation, soil hydraulic properties, plant
    responses

    to water deﬁcits, and changes in weather factors, that can help save water and
    increase

    yields [25]. By using smart irrigation systems, farmers can save precious resources
    without

    exposing plants to moisture deﬁciencies [26]. Smart irrigation has been argued
    as a way

    to manage soil variability and gain economic beneﬁts by fulﬁlling the speciﬁc
    irrigation

    demands of individual crops [27]. It is also implied that the smart irrigation
    system will

    be managed in such a way that will enable nutrients and water to be delivered
    directly

    to the plant roots [28]. To the best of our knowledge, studies addressing the
    issue of low

    water productivity in dryland agriculture and its improvement through adoption
    of smart

    irrigation approaches is limited. Therefore, the speciﬁc objectives of this article
    were (i) to

    present an overview of the constraints of low water use efﬁciency in dryland agriculture,

    (ii) to assess the conventional irrigation scheduling methods, and (iii) to examine
    the

    feasibility and beneﬁts of smart irrigation systems for better irrigation management
    to

    enhance water productivity in water-scarce regions.

    2. Major Constraints of Agricultural Productivity in Drylands

    2.1. Land Degradation

    Natural processes such as vegetation loss, wildﬁres, overgrazing, climate change,

    wind and water erosion and other adverse/destructive anthropogenic activities
    cause land

    degradation (Figure 1) [3,29]. This causes a substantial decline in the functional
    capabilities

    of those speciﬁc areas, negatively inﬂuences agricultural activities and productivity
    and

    natural resources management, creates economic loss, and loss in biological activity
    [30].

    Generally, land degradation is more critical or serious in dryland, semiarid and
    arid

    areas [31]. These include some parts of central Asia, China, Africa and the Mediterranean

    basin [32]. Land degradation in Africa highly impacts Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia
    (horn

    of Africa) [33]. A prominent sign of land degradation is the occurrence of unexpected

    climatic conditions and vegetative stress [34]. Moreover, low levels of soil nitrogen
    and

    organic carbon (C) show a state of land degradation that leads to very low soil
    fertility [35].

    Stavi and Lal [36] reported that land degradation increases by 5–10 million hectares
    every

    year globally. Ibrahim et al. [37] found that the increase in land degradation
    observed in the

    Africa Saharan region was mainly due to the increase in drought frequency from
    1968–1990.

    Figure 1. Global distribution of land degradation based on severity of human-induced
    pressure [29].

    To gain insight into land degradation intensity, statistical methods and models
    have

    been utilized using data collected over the years. These models allow precise
    predictions

    about land degradation intensity [38]. Normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) is

    one of the methods used to measure the vegetation mass over a speciﬁc area [39].
    NDVI

    represents the vegetation state of an area in terms of numerical values. If numerical

    values are negative, it means there is a reduction in vegetation. A study carried
    out by

    Ibrahim et al. [37] using residual trend analysis of NDVI showed substantial evidence
    of soil

    degradation in sub-Saharan West Africa. The study also highlighted the drought
    occurrence

    caused by vegetation decline in Africa. Pravalie et al. [40] reported that the
    impending

    increase in land degradation is posing serious threats to the people of developing
    countries.

    Disease proliferation, decrease in crop yields and increasing armed conﬂicts are
    the major

    outcomes of land deterioration. A possible solution to land degradation is to
    achieve a state

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    4 of 25

    of land degradation neutrality (LDN) [41]. LDN is a state where land is retained
    in a stable

    condition capable of enduring biological functions including facilitating appropriate
    food

    security [42]. Sustainable land management practices such as soil amendments (addition
    of

    biochar, manuring, composting) to restore degraded lands could be used to decrease
    the

    effects of land degradation [43].

    2.2. Water Scarcity Issues and Sustainable Development Goals

    Water availability is one of the main indicators of land degradation, and upsurge
    in

    land degradation is potentially aggravating water scarcity [44,45]. Availability
    of water is

    jeopardized by lessening of ground and surface water due to reduction in biomass
    [46].

    This results in less water available for agricultural (Figure 2) [16] and domestic
    use. Scarcity

    of water is an indicator of safe water; hence, water scarcity is a deﬁciency in
    fresh water

    resources to meet the standard water demand [11]. Successful achievement of SDGs
    is

    dependent upon the water security of both human and environmental systems (Figure
    3)

    because water is directly linked to all SDGs [7]. The leading reasons for water
    scarcity are

    droughts, climate change, and inaccessibility and inadequate management of resources
    [47].

    Rosa et al. [16] reported that in 2012, almost 2.3 billion people did not have
    access to safe

    water. Access to safe water is an important factor as it decreases disease frequency
    and

    social problems, including unemployment, malnutrition, and poverty [48]. Agriculture

    and industrial sectors use the largest proportion of water, and this water is
    usually drawn

    from below ground, lakes and rivers [49]. Falkenmark [50] reported that water
    scarcity

    poses substantial threats to the agriculture sector, which requires sufﬁcient
    quantity of

    water for irrigation. Crop production and food security are directly dependent
    on sufﬁcient

    water availability [51]. Water scarcity leads to plant stress, resulting in various
    environ-

    mental problems, such as intensiﬁed soil erosion and salt concentration [52].
    Increasing

    climate change, land degradation, and population necessitate the development of
    effective

    management systems to wisely mitigate water scarcity [53–55].

    Figure 2. The global distribution of agricultural blue water scarcity (BWS), green
    water scarcity

    (GWS), and economic water scarcity (EWS) [16].

    Liu et al. [12] described the common indicators employed to evaluate water scarcity,

    such as IWMI, (a system that evaluates the economic and physical changes inﬂuencing
    the

    availability of water within a country), the criticality ratio (a ratio of water
    consumption

    to the available water resources) and Falkenmark indicator (which compares the
    quantity

    of available water against the number of people who consume that water). Water
    stress

    and crowding indices may also be employed to measure water scarcity in a country.
    These

    indices also estimate the decrease or increase in water scarcity. Efforts are
    required to

    curtail the water scarcity issues. In this regard, implementing efﬁcient water
    use practices

    and managing water in high-risk regions are important aspects to address [45].
    These

    efforts could decrease water scarcity and increase access to adequate agricultural
    and

    drinking water. Moreover, by taking care of structural and social customs, governments

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    5 of 25

    can effectively resolve major conﬂicts. Hence, joint efforts are needed from governments

    and research institutes to resolve the water scarcity problem successfully [56].

    security for humans

    and environment.

    availability of water within a country), the criticality ratio (a ratio of water
    consumption

    to the available water resources) and Falkenmark indicator (which compares the
    quantity

    of available water against the number of people who consume that water). Water
    stress

    and crowding indices may also be employed to measure water scarcity in a country.
    These

    indices also estimate the decrease or increase in water scarcity. Efforts are
    required to

    curtail the water scarcity issues. In this regard, implementing efﬁcient water
    use practices

    and managing water in high-risk regions are important aspects to address [45].
    These

    efforts could decrease water scarcity and increase access to adequate agricultural
    and

    drinking water. Moreover, by taking care of structural and social customs, governments

    can effectively resolve major conﬂicts. Hence, joint efforts are needed from governments

    and research institutes to resolve the water scarcity problem successfully [56].

    2.3. Climate Variability

    Variations/changes in climatic conditions often impact human, biological and agri-

    cultural systems through decreasing water resources, rising global temperatures,
    heavy

    precipitation, elevation in permafrost thawing, worsening water and air quality,
    rise in

    sea level, health risk, food supply and availability, intense drought, disturbing
    rainfall

    periods, and devastating effects on coastal infrastructure [57,58]. East Africa
    is an exam-

    ple of climatic anomalies, and the progression of increased rainy seasons, droughts
    and

    temperatures is detrimental to the development of this area [59]. In Tanzania,
    crop data

    techniques predicted a yield reduction of 7.6%, 8.8%, and 13% in rice, sorghum
    and maize

    by 2050, respectively [3]. The impacts of variation in climatic events are signiﬁcantly
    neg-

    ative [60], for example, the Mediterranean Basin has shown a prominent rise in
    average

    temperatures beyond global changes, with signiﬁcant impacts on plant processes
    and

    water resources [61]. Climatic variation may induce a signiﬁcant reduction in
    crop growth

    and productivity and increase vector-borne diseases, thus threatening food security
    [62].

    Heavy rain and early frost may have negative effects on ﬂowering periods and induce

    frost damage, while dry seasons or droughts largely decrease the decomposition
    of soil

    organic matter [63]. Such alterations induce negative impacts on biological systems.
    Fitness

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    6 of 25

    of the population is one of the main factors negatively affecting community structures

    and population dynamics [64]. Thus, it becomes vital to develop mitigation practices
    to

    decrease climate change impacts on agriculture. Several mitigation protocols for
    climate

    change impacts suggested by Haussmann et al. [65] and Gomez-Zavaglia et al. [66]
    are:

    (i) developing skills for water management, (ii) improving methods of breeding
    selection,

    (iii) capacity building of farmers, (iv) genetically improved seeds with better
    adaptation

    to increased temperatures, (v) reducing livestock and crop emissions, (vi) changes
    in net

    irrigation, and (vii) sequestering carbon in soils.

    2.4. Overexploitation of Groundwater

    Increasing economic growth has resulted in continuous demand for water, leading

    to groundwater overexploitation, especially in big cities [67]. Both humans and
    the en-

    vironment rely heavily upon groundwater; therefore, understanding its environmental

    implications is vital [68]. Over-pumping of water is a global issue, primarily
    caused via

    agricultural water use. Among its effects are the drying of wetlands and streams,
    phreato-

    phytic vegetation elimination, soil subsidence, storage loss, decline in groundwater
    level,

    increased pumping cost, and soil salinization [69,70]. Recently, the exploitation
    of ground-

    water resources has become increasingly critical, especially in semiarid and arid
    coastal

    areas. In these regions, the coastal aquifers are at risk due to the intrusion
    of salty marine

    water. For example, Tripoli in northwestern Libya has been experiencing progressive

    seawater intrusion into its coastal aquifers since the 1930s due to its ever-growing
    demand

    for water [71]. Groundwater overexploitation not only causes water-quality degradation

    and aquifer depletion but also inﬂuences the ecological stability of wetlands
    and streams,

    resulting in substantial losses of biodiversity and habitat. Therefore, societies
    should realize

    that water resources are vulnerable and ﬁnite and discover methods to resolve
    the stresses

    of human development on nature’s tolerance. Educating the public about human inﬂuences

    on the environment is the ﬁrst step toward sustainable water use.

    2.5. Socioeconomic Drivers

    The adverse impacts on water availability, agricultural productivity, and economic
    fea-

    sibility have been correlated with the displacement of residents [49]. Countries
    dependent

    on other countries’ agricultural productive capabilities are also seriously affected.
    Food

    insecurity and hunger are common outcomes of poor agricultural production phases
    for

    millions who are dependent on agriculture [72]. The 1980s famine in Africa resulted
    from a

    decline in agricultural productivity [73,74]. Generally, droughts indicate decreased
    food

    security [75]. Between 1992 and 1995, drought periods aggravated already problematic

    conditions in Africa. There was income loss for farmers, a rise in unemployment,
    and

    a decline in maize export to neighboring states. Moreover, there was an emergence
    in

    incurred service debts through farmers [76]. Gebremskel et al. [33] stated that
    drought

    periods in East Africa have caused more than 0.5 million deaths and ﬁnancial losses
    up

    to US $1,500,000. Several rural residents heavily rely on land productivity. Thus,
    rising

    water scarcity, land degradation and drought frequency cause adverse effects on
    people’s

    lives [77]. Couttenier et al. [78] reported that social conﬂict could erupt as
    a result of de-

    creased availability of farmland and water (e.g., civil war in Darfur). Rifts
    for agricultural

    resources and farmland often generate deadly circumstances. Ongoing conﬂicts among

    Fulani herdsmen farmers in Nigeria are another example of such conﬂicts. These
    conﬂicts

    resulted in 68% of total deaths in north-central Nigeria [79].

    2.6. Droughts

    Drought is a condition of abnormally dry weather sufﬁciently prolonged, lacking
    wa-

    ter to induce hydrologic imbalance and constraining agricultural activities in
    the affected

    region [80]. Drought types such as inter-annual droughts stay longer and decrease
    crop

    productivity, whereas inter-seasonal drought may be short and controlled via efﬁcient

    water management [81]. Hermans and McLeman [82] reported that repeated occurrence

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    7 of 25

    of drought contributed towards degradation of land. Henchiri [83] reported that
    sub-

    Saharan Africa has faced long periods of drought with greater intensity. Nijbroek
    et al. [84]

    demonstrated that Namibia is an arid country and faced drought for many years,
    as well

    as neighboring counties of South Africa being liable to droughts repeatedly triggered
    by

    El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a system of warm seawater that passes over
    the

    Paciﬁc about every 10 years. Climate change could trigger desertiﬁcation, induce
    natural

    calamities and environmental susceptibility. An increase in drought frequency
    is also

    expected because of climate change [85]. Droughts cause extreme distress to food
    security,

    agricultural productivity, and the economy [81]. Losses of up to US $120,000,000,000
    were

    noted over a period of 30 years in Europe. In southern Africa, more than 10,000,000
    tons of

    food was needed in terms of aid to drought-affected areas [3]. Africa has an unpleasant

    history of droughts with devastating effects on food security [86]. The most disturbing

    drought was during 1991–1992. It caused a huge loss in agricultural productivity,
    massive

    unemployment, and economic despair. Given the detrimental effects of drought,
    it is

    important to improve agricultural practices in response to droughts. One such
    practice is

    environmental restoration. Land restoration helps to reduce land degradation impacts
    [87].

    Rigorous land restoration can be attained through tree plantations in degraded
    lands.

    Alternatively, in situ planting of seeds that could lead to natural regeneration
    may also

    be used [87]. Predicting droughts is also useful for proper mitigation. Recently,
    scien-

    tists in Kenya introduced a technology by satellite analysis, which can forecast
    droughts

    with 90% accuracy [88]. Moreover, better water management techniques and planting

    drought-resistant trees and crops may remove the distressing damage droughts have
    on the

    agriculture. Thus, most African nations should focus on irrigation as a method
    to reduce

    drought impacts (Figure 4) [89].

    Figure 4. Countries affected by drought in 2020–2022 [89].

    2.7. Conventional Technology

    In dryland regions, most farmers employ old farming techniques that result in
    fail-

    ure to manage food for increasing populations [90]. The traditional farming techniques

    generate little food [3]. Agriculture conservation (crop rotation, soil cover
    and minimum

    tillage) could help to enhance crop yields with increasing proﬁtability and decreasing
    soil

    degradation [91]. Some techniques are not used by subsistence farmers mainly because
    of

    unfamiliarity [92]. The implication of microbial-resistant varieties or seeds
    is less common

    in Africa [93]. These advancements have the capability to improve yield and increase

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    8 of 25

    stress tolerance. Nonetheless, most farmers in rural areas are lacking access
    to services and

    information to be effectively used in their favor [94]. Sarkar et al. [95] reported
    that the use

    of modern techniques is helpful and provides opportunities to farmers for increasing
    the

    crop yields. Digitizing farming methods permits farmers to guess the yield and
    weather

    forecast, select suitable crops according to the area, and improve irrigation
    systems. Nuclear

    technology is also used as a tool to increase yield via radioactive isotope utilization.
    These

    are used as early detectors and tracers of the existence of diseases. Moreover,
    applying

    nuclear technology in agricultural practices can increase crop productivity by
    40%, improve

    soil structure and texture, and decrease labor and input costs [96]. Nonetheless,
    the main

    hindrance is that modern farming techniques and technologies are not available
    to the

    majority of farmers in dryland areas.

    3. Traditional Approaches Used for Irrigation Scheduling

    The amount of water and its application timing is crucial in irrigation scheduling

    (IS), either in agriculture or landscapes [97,98]. Irrigation water requirement
    is measured

    following a criterion that determines irrigation needs and methods to apply a
    calculated

    amount of water [18]. In order to use irrigation water efﬁciently, we have to
    understand the

    dynamics of plant water use, together with weather, plant physiology, and soil
    properties.

    Among the various irrigation scheduling approaches developed and suggested, three

    types are most important: weather-based, soil moisture-based, and plant water
    status-

    based [28,99].

    3.1. Weather-Based Irrigation Scheduling

    In weather-based irrigation planning, reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is calculated

    by measuring the weather elements that reﬂect the amount of water lost via plants
    and

    soil [28]. Solar radiation, humidity, air temperature and wind speed inﬂuence
    the quantity

    of water lost through evapotranspiration. In the absence of soil and plant measurements,

    weather attributes are used to determine irrigation schedules based on evapotranspira-

    tion [100]. Reference evapotranspiration can be calculated following the FAO Penman–

    Monteith equation by measuring the solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature
    and

    humidity [100,101]. Daily crop water use can be calculated by:

    ETc = Kc × ET0

    where ETc = crop evapotranspiration (mm day−1), Kc = crop coefﬁcient, and ET0
    = reference

    evapotranspiration (mm day−1).

    The method is strongly dependent on (1) the accurate calculation of ET0, (2) better
    Kc

    curve development over the entire crop-growing season, (3) determination of soil
    water-

    holding capacity by analyzing soil properties, and (4) quantifying site-specific
    rainfall [102].

    Mostly, real-time weather monitoring systems are equipped with an automatic weather
    station

    containing sensors for temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, atmospheric
    pressure,

    and solar radiation [103]. These data loggers are designed to obtain data automatically
    at

    periodic intervals, and these data are transferred to an online data access portal.
    Data loggers

    communicate with remote servers using a wireless sensor network (WSN) or Internet
    of

    Things (IoT) framework [18]. WSN is one of the most popular technological methods
    that is

    used to precisely monitor the weather and environmental parameters [104–108].
    These data

    finally reach smart irrigation controllers, which in combination with site-specific
    variables

    (e.g., soil type), set up the irrigation schedule. The selection and performance
    of a weather

    monitoring system depends upon different accuracy, installation, robustness, data
    acquisition,

    maintenance, and power requirements. An IoT-based weather monitoring system demon-

    strated by Wasson et al. [109] monitors and analyzes the crop environment in terms
    of wind

    speed, temperature, solar radiation, soil moisture, and humidity using various
    weather-based

    sensors connected through a wireless network for data transfer and web-based services.
    Like-

    wise, Khoa et al. [110] implemented an IoT platform for smart irrigation management.
    They

    suggested an innovative topology of sensor nodes with low cost. The authors were
    satisfied

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    9 of 25

    with the performance of the LoRa LPWAN (long-range low-power wide area network)
    tech-

    nology transmission module system. A multiagent-based monitoring approach consisting

    of an open-source platform (PANGEA) was used to collect data on weather elements
    and

    soil moisture via different sensors. This platform is equipped with several master
    and slave

    nodes connected through sensors for data transfer [111]. Many researchers [112–114]
    have

    also employed WSN and IoT based platforms for weather-based monitoring and reported

    satisfactory performance of the systems. Although weather-based irrigation scheduling
    is

    widely practiced, the heterogeneity of soil properties used to estimate soil water
    volume

    affects the amount of available soil water. In addition to that, spatiotemporal,
    variability in

    large-scale evapotranspiration is another challenge confronted by this approach.

    3.2. Plant-Based Irrigation Scheduling

    Plant-based irrigation scheduling mainly relies on several indices indicating
    plant

    water status [115]. The relationship between soil moisture deﬁcit and crop water
    stress

    helps to determine irrigation scheduling. Plant-based irrigation scheduling is
    sensitive to

    measurements conducted at a speciﬁc crop stage to determine water deﬁcit in plants
    [18].

    Since varying plant species, plant tissues, and crop growth stages have variable
    sensi-

    tivity to moisture deﬁcit, several plant-based stress measurements have been suggested

    for irrigation scheduling [99]. There are two principal categories based on plant
    vari-

    able measurements used for irrigation scheduling: ﬁrstly, plant water status-based
    direct

    measurements including leaf, stem, and xylem water potential status and indirect
    mea-

    surements pertinent to leaf thickness, turgor pressure, and trunk diameter [116,117];
    and

    secondly, plant physiology-based estimates including sap ﬂow, stomatal conductance,

    xylem cavitation, and thermal sensing [118]. A leaf turgor pressure sensor estimates
    the

    relative change in leaf turgor pressure to determine leaf water stress [119].
    In addition to

    transpiration water loss, root water uptake and cellular osmotic pressure determine
    the

    magnitude of turgor pressure. For example, a ZIM probe (leaf turgor pressure sensor)
    is

    a noninvasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe that can detect leaf turgor pressure.
    ZIM

    probes are capable of measuring even minute shifts of turgor pressure within leaves
    in real

    time [119,120].

    Due to advanced electronic technologies, researchers have developed small leaf
    sensors

    and tested them against cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.)

    plants. Leaf thickness-based irrigation timing improved WUE by 25–45% compared
    to preset

    irrigation plans [121]. In another study, Afzal et al. [122] reported that leaf
    thickness and leaf

    electrical capacitance (CAP) could be employed for leaf water status monitoring.
    Based on

    energy balance and heat pulse, thermal sensors have been developed to determine
    sap flow

    from plant stems, assisting irrigation scheduling. Sap-flow methods are able to
    provide in

    situ measurements of plant water use and transpiration dynamics. The Dynagage
    sap-flow

    sensors are the latest ones used to estimate sap ﬂow and thus the water consumption
    by

    plant. The amount of heat utilized by the sap is measured by the energy balance
    sensors

    and gives the real-time sap ﬂow in grams or kilograms per hour. These sensors
    require

    no calibration and offer an efﬁcient and affordable method to determine the water
    use of

    plants [28]. During transpiration, the water in the xylem subjected to tension
    is directly

    proportional to the deﬁcit in water to the point where the water columns can rupture
    or

    cavitate [123]. This cavitation leads to the eruptive formation of a bubble that
    contains

    water vapor [124]. Audio or ultrasonic frequency signals can detect these cavitation
    events,

    and the associated embolisms can hinder water ﬂow [116]. Detection of such ultrasonic

    acoustic emissions (AEs) indicates plant stress and cavitation events. Thus, the
    AE rate can

    be used as a sensor to detect plant stress.

    Stem Diameter Fluctuations

    Stem and fruit diameter experience diurnal ﬂuctuations due to changing water con-

    tent [125]. Various water stress indicators can be determined by analyzing the
    daily patterns

    of stem diameter variation (SDV) [126]. The maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and
    stem

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    10 of 25

    growth rate (SGR) are commonly used indicators for scheduling irrigation [115].
    Currently,

    different optical sensors are used to detect plant water status, nutrient level
    and health

    condition. Two types of optical sensors (contact and noncontact) are primarily
    used [18].

    Contact sensors are physically connected to plants, whereas noncontact sensors
    are vehicle-

    mounted, ﬁxed, handled, or remotely controlled (aerial vehicles or satellite data)
    [28]. In

    many studies, monitoring through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high-resolution

    cameras helped to generate irrigation maps over large cropped areas [127,128].
    In another

    study, Lozoya et al. [129] used a sensor network to control green pepper growth
    under four

    different irrigation designs.

    Bauer and Aschenbruck [130] employed IoT and sensor network integration to moni-

    tor leaf area for optimizing irrigation. Several factors other than water content
    can affect the

    SDV-derived index, such as plant age, crop load, and ﬁeld management practices.
    Further-

    more, SDV estimates are usually affected by small raindrops and animals [131].
    Canopy

    temperature measurement is another key method commonly employed for irrigation

    scheduling. Major canopy temperature-based methods include the crop water stress
    index

    (CWSI), temperature–time threshold (TTT), and temperature stress day (TSD) [132–134].

    Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras are used to detect temperature. However,
    diur-

    nal dynamics of temperature remain a major challenge for all the canopy temperature-based

    methods [99]. A major drawback of using plant-based sensors for irrigation management

    is that they lack direct estimates of irrigation water amount to be applied. Soil
    textural vari-

    ability is another challenge affecting the accurate estimation of irrigation amounts
    needed.

    3.3. Irrigation Scheduling Based on Soil Moisture

    Soil moisture monitoring is one of the fundamental approaches used for irrigation

    scheduling, and it is conducted by determining the soil water content or the soil
    water po-

    tential [135]. Monitoring soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution
    is critical for

    optimal irrigation scheduling [28]. Different types of sensors, such as time-domain
    transmis-

    sion, neutron probes, granular matrix, and capacitance, are commonly implemented
    for soil

    moisture determination [136]. Gravimetric sampling to estimate soil moisture ﬂuxes
    and a

    tensiometer is also used to measure soil matric potential, reﬂecting the amount
    of soil water

    available for plant use [99]. With the advancement of technology, satellite and
    groundwater

    sensors are becoming popular as irrigation tools. Soil moisture sensors can be
    installed at

    multiple depths in the ﬁeld and capture soil moisture dynamics. They enhance accuracy

    and improve understanding of changes appearing in soil water content pertinent
    to crop

    water use and irrigation [137]. Soil sensors also provide information about soil
    chemical,

    physical and mechanical properties obtained in the form of optical, electrical,
    mechanical,

    electromagnetic, acoustic, radiometric, and pneumatic measurements [138]. Measurement

    of these attributes assists in the estimation of maximum allowable depletion [139].
    Soil

    moisture sensors estimate the volumetric moisture content (VMC) by detecting changes
    in

    soil electrical and thermal properties [140].

    Frequency-domain reﬂectometry sensors (FDR) can estimate ﬁeld soil moisture con-

    tent [129]. The sensors are put near the crop roots and show a moisture content
    range of

    0–50% with 0.1% resolution, thus optimizing water use for vegetables. Shigeta
    et al. [141]

    found that real-time soil moisture sensing can be used in practical measurements
    of soil

    moisture ﬂuxes by correlating the VWC of the soil with the capacitance of sensors
    inserted

    in the soil. In TDR sensors, two parallel rods are inserted at the desired depth
    to measure

    the soil moisture content. The rate of the electromagnetic pulse, which radiates
    from the

    sensor into the soil and returns to the soil surface, is directly proportional
    to soil water

    content. However, this is an expensive method for farmers. Other studies [142–144]
    in-

    terconnected IoT-based ﬁeld monitoring with cloud-based monitoring and data analysis

    using an Ardunio controller. They found that the collected data were used to make
    predic-

    tions that helped reduce water consumption and improve crop yields. In another
    study,

    six capacitance-based sensors were used at three locations with a data logger
    [145]. This

    method improved the WUE compared to traditional approaches. Soil moisture-based
    irri-

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    11 of 25

    gation scheduling has the disadvantage that plant water uptake and stress are
    affected by

    soil moisture content and also inﬂuenced by environmental conditions, pests and
    diseases,

    root zone salinity, and nutrient availability. Variation in soil properties also
    affects irrigation

    scheduling, which necessitates soil testing at multiple points for accurate estimation
    of soil

    moisture content.

    4. Innovative Smart Irrigation Approaches

    A smart irrigation system consists of ﬁrmware, software, and hardware interconnected

    via various computational techniques, including artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and
    deep learn-

    ing (DL) etc., which ensures the right amount of water at the appropriate time
    in crops to

    improve WUE, increase yield, reduce fertilizer use, reduce labor cost, and save
    energy [146].

    Various control methods are employed to improve irrigation system efﬁciency by
    mon-

    itoring variables such as canopy and air temperature, evapotranspiration, rainfall,
    and

    solar radiation. By integrating information from multiple sources, smart irrigation
    systems

    can signiﬁcantly improve crop production and resource management [147]. The follow-

    ing section presents various recent techniques associated with smart irrigation
    systems

    in agriculture.

    4.1. State-of-the-Art Smart Irrigation Technologies

    4.1.1. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning

    AI is a machine’s ability to learn and implement tasks similar to those of a human

    brain, and it is powered by computers [148]. When applied to a certain problem
    domain,

    AI algorithms can mimic human decision-making. Irrigation systems have been integrated

    with AI for adaptive decision-making through fuzzy logic, expert systems, and
    ANNs [149].

    An artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is an algorithm for processing information that
    is

    inspired by the working of the human brain [150]. Like human brain neurons, an
    ANN

    also contains a neural network, but synapses are substituted with biased connections
    and

    weights [151]. This facilitates the mapping of input and output relationships
    [152]. ANN-

    based control systems can learn and adapt to the variable dynamics, making them
    ideal

    for irrigation systems. Additionally, ANNs have been used as smart strategies
    in dealing

    with the issue of formulating mathematical models based on ﬁrst principles. Recently,

    many researchers have employed ANN methods for irrigation scheduling. Using the

    AQUACROP model integrated with a dynamic neural network, Adeyemi et al. (2018)
    [149]

    simulated soil moisture for a potato crop. Karasekreter et al. [153] demonstrated
    energy and

    water savings up to 23.9% and 20.5%, respectively, by implementing an ANN integrated

    with soil physical properties and moisture content in a strawberry orchard. Umair
    and

    Muhammad [154] designed an ANN-based controller model in MATLAB using climate

    variables as input.

    A fuzzy logic system is an extension of Boolean logic that expresses logical values
    in

    the form of true or false and demonstrates the nonlinearity and uncertainty in
    real-world

    problems [155]. The fuzzy system uses different sets of input data to categorize
    data in

    membership classes, and then applies a decision rule to every set to produce human-like

    decision outputs [103]. Many researchers have recommended the use of fuzzy logic
    in

    irrigation control systems. Mendes et al. [156] designed a fuzzy inference system
    that can

    control the speed of the central pivot according to the spatial ﬁeld variability.
    A fuzzy

    irrigation system developed by Mousa et al. [157] was used to compute evapotranspiration

    (ETo) via a fuzzy inference system using weather variables as input. They found
    that the

    fuzzy model was accurate and quick in obtaining the required evapotranspiration
    and

    net irrigation to recover the water loss. An expert system is another type of
    intelligent

    system used for irrigation control. Basically, an expert system is a computer
    program that

    simulates the verdict and behavior of an individual or organization with expertise
    in a

    certain area through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies [158].

    Expert systems can be used for problem-solving activities such as monitoring,
    control,

    planning, forecasting, prescribing, fusion, and decision-making [159]. An expert-controlled

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    12 of 25

    irrigation system enables farmers to quantify the water amount needed by crops
    at the ap-

    propriate time by considering the weather and soil conditions. Many researchers
    [160,161]

    have implemented expert systems for irrigation management. The expert system uses

    various knowledge-based inputs for accurate decision-making about irrigation schedul-

    ing. However, errors in knowledge-based input can seriously affect the performance
    and

    reliability of expert systems [162].

    A hybrid intelligence system is another type of intelligent control system in
    which at

    least two artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms such as fuzzy logic and neural network
    are com-

    bined, known as “neuro-fuzzy” [149]. Other examples of such hybrid intelligence
    systems

    include fuzzy PID and GAPSO. Tsang et al. [152] employed seven different machine-

    learning algorithms to assess soil moisture conditions using aerial images of
    agricultural

    ﬁelds to control irrigation. The results demonstrated a 52% reduction in water
    consumption

    by reducing timing, irrigation level, and location errors. Similarly, a combination
    of ANN,

    genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bayesian framework was implemented to forecast
    daily

    irrigation demand under limited data conditions [163]. The results exhibited an
    improve-

    ment in forecast precision by 3% and 11%. Many other studies also demonstrated
    the use

    of intelligent hybrid systems and reported precise forecasting and improved control
    of

    irrigation systems [164,165].

    The deep learning method is now applied to deal with millions of weights among
    neu-

    rons for a better understanding of behaviors owing to recent developments in computing

    technology in parallel processing, software and hardware. Deep learning has developed
    a

    revolutionary epoch, since it can solve the problems confronted by artiﬁcial intelligence

    for a long period [166]. Deep learning has been applied in the agriculture and
    hydrology

    ﬁelds due to difﬁculty in software data availability, budget, and complexity,
    such as crop

    evapotranspiration modeling and approximation [167]. Wang and Ma [168] reported
    that

    the traditional machine learning and deep learning models work similarly as a
    data-driven

    artiﬁcial intelligence technique and could be applied to model the convoluted
    correla-

    tion between input and output (Table 1). Nonetheless, deep learning has an advantage

    over traditional machine learning techniques because of its great hierarchical
    structure

    model [169].

    4.1.2. Model Predictive Irrigation Systems

    Development in smart agriculture through internet usage and increasing computa-

    tional power facilitated large data collection from agricultural systems [180].
    The model

    predictive system has been employed in irrigation scheduling, irrigation canal
    control, soil

    moisture, and stem water potential regulation [55]. Model predictive control (MPC)
    has

    manifested applicability to gate operation and control the canal ﬂow. The management

    goal of model predictive control for canals is to maintain the level of water
    as close to

    the set-points as possible [181]. Thus, an appropriate model regulating the dynamics
    of

    canal-water levels is required. A model predictive control system has been employed
    to

    model water movement in the canals, keeping a speciﬁc level of water at different
    locations

    and the ﬂow of water that affects these water levels [182–184]. The controlling
    instruments

    maintain the ﬂow of water, by which the regulator can attain the management goals
    [180].

    Nonetheless, attaining this goal is not straightforward, as variations in inﬂows
    and outﬂows

    interrupt the whole water system. To estimate future water ﬂows and levels in
    response to

    control actions and disturbances, the water system (controller, canal reaches,
    disturbances

    and structures) needs to be modeled. Several authors have applied MPC in driving
    irri-

    gation ﬂows of canals. For instance, Puig et al. [185] applied MPC to create ﬂow
    control

    approaches from the source of water to the user and Guadiana River’s irrigation
    territory.

    The results exhibited the usefulness of the MPC application. Zhang et al. [186]
    developed a

    non-cooperative distributed MPC algorithm based on Nash optimality for the regulation

    of water levels in canals. The simulation of system results indicated the efﬁcacy
    of the

    advocated algorithm. To efﬁciently deliver the ﬂow of a canal without oscillations,
    MPC

    was combined with online water storage to allow for a delay and evade wave distraction.

    The results indicated the signiﬁcant development of canal setups using automation
    [180].

    4.1.3. Variable-Rate Irrigation (VRI)

    VRI is a method of applying irrigation at variable rates in different irrigation
    manage-

    ment zones over the entire ﬁeld in an optimized way [187]. Normally, the application
    of

    irrigation water is uniform in the entire ﬁeld. However, owing to soil spatial
    variability in

    soil topography, hydraulic properties and vegetation condition, the soil moisture
    content

    remains nonuniform [188]. When such soil spatial variability becomes signiﬁcant,
    the ﬁeld

    is split into different management zones consisting of those ﬁeld areas with the
    same soil

    properties and crop conditions [150]. Then, irrigation is applied at differential
    rates in

    different management zones [189]. Such variable irrigation management may enhance
    the

    economic value of irrigation by improving WUE, increasing productivity and reduction
    in

    nutrient leaching [190]. This enables an accurate and timely water application
    based on

    soil spatiotemporal properties and plant demand [191].

    In other words, VRI technology ensures the application of the right amount of
    water

    at the right time in the right ﬁeld zone, resulting in signiﬁcant water savings.
    The main

    components of VRI technology include sensors, prescription maps, spatial information,

    and a unit system to apply VRI prescription (lateral irrigation) in the crop ﬁeld
    [192].

    Optimization of VRI prescriptions is usually determined by using remote sensing,
    yield

    maps, topography, soil apparent electrical conductivity and soil maps [193,194].
    There are

    different types of irrigation systems used for VRI applications. The variable-rate
    lateral

    irrigation system contains a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or global
    positioning

    system (GPS) receiver, custom software-operated relays, and valves, thus supplying
    water

    at variable rates using the nozzle-pulsing method with a speed controller [26].
    This system

    has high accuracy in controlling the irrigation rate and forward speed [195].
    Likewise,

    the center pivot VRI system consists of a VRI and pivot control panels, control
    nodes,

    solenoid valves, a GNSS, a remote sensing control system, and a variable-frequency
    drive

    (VFD) [191].

    The speed and operation of the pivot are regulated by pivot control. The VRI controller

    panel governs the irrigation application based on pivot location and the prescription
    map.

    The ﬂow of sprinkler heads is controlled by solenoid valves [26]. The pivot positioning

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    14 of 25

    is regulated by the GNSS system, and the control nodes attached to the pivot govern
    the

    valve opening and closing. VFD regulates the pressure by altering the irrigation
    rate at

    different points in the ﬁeld [196]. The rotation speed of the pump impeller is
    also controlled

    by the VFD in response to the input communicated by the pressure switch mounted
    on

    the pump. It helps to maintain the pressure within the predeﬁned threshold limits
    [197].

    The use of VRI technology offers several advantages over conventional irrigation
    methods.

    VRI can substantially improve overall yields by avoiding under-irrigation and/or
    over-

    irrigation. The growers usually set up soil moisture sensors in those ﬁeld areas
    with low

    soil water-holding capacity (WHC) to prevent under-irrigation in the ﬁeld [198].
    This

    practice may increase irrigation frequency, leading to over- irrigation with high
    soil WHC.

    Over-irrigation may result in yield loss due to nutrient leaching and depletion
    of oxygen in

    the root zone [39]. The prevention of under-irrigation in those ﬁeld areas with
    higher yield

    potential could help optimize water input.

    Another advantage of using VRI is that irrigation can be withheld over those ﬁeld

    areas that are not arable [199]. VRI also supports fertilizer application at variable
    rates that

    would beneﬁt in matching the variability in crop nutrient requirements [200].
    A two-year

    study led by Sui and Yan [192] demonstrated that crop water productivity for corn
    and

    soybean was much better under VRI than uniform rate irrigation (URI) in Mississippi.
    In

    another investigation, application of VRI with delineated management zones based
    on the

    difference in WHC showed better crop water productivity for maize and winter wheat,

    which was higher than the overall average of the ﬁeld [201]. Besides its several
    advantages,

    VRI also has some disadvantages, including higher cost, complexity in developing
    soil

    maps, and maintenance of the system [202]. Overall, VRI technology is a good option
    to

    precisely utilize precious water resources, but considerable efforts are needed
    to make this

    technology affordable and more user-friendly.

    4.1.4. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for Irrigation Management

    UAVs, also called drones [203], are frequently linked with military operations,
    as they

    are used as weapons for targeting aircraft and involved in intelligence services.
    Recently,

    drones have been used in a wide range of applications, including delivery services,
    weather

    monitoring, trafﬁc monitoring, surveillance, and rescue [204]. Several studies
    emphasized

    UAV utilization for forecasting and monitoring in agriculture to maintain crop
    health [205].

    Drones are also useful for irrigation monitoring, as they use infrared or thermal
    imaging

    cameras in the IOT network [206]. Manual spraying of pesticides induces lethal
    diseases to

    workers globally, as described by the World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture

    Organization [207]. Thus, UAVs could be a potential alternative to manual pesticide

    spraying, reducing the potential ecological/environmental risks and health problems
    [205].

    Recently, UAVs with IoT-based sensor networks have been used for smart irriga-

    tion purposes, thus signiﬁcantly improving crop productivity [208]. Chebrolu et
    al. [209]

    suggested a technique of UAV images to rebuild a three-dimensional crop model
    that

    mediates crop growth monitoring based on a plant level. Likewise, the plant height
    of

    sorghum and maize plants was measured based on UAV images and a three-dimensional

    model [210]. Roth et al. [211] reported that the RMSE (root-mean-square error)
    was

    0.33 m for a single sorghum’s height. The soybean leaf area index was extracted
    using 3D

    and UAV plant models. In another study, carried out by Deng et al. [212], different
    cameras

    were ﬁxed on UAVs for smart farming. The results indicated that the UAV-based
    multiband

    images are useful and showed substantial ability for precise irrigation and agriculture

    management. RGB (red, green and blue) cameras can be used with a drone to determine

    crop biomass using visible reﬂectance for assessing vegetation indices [213].
    According to

    Rokhmana [214], using UAVs for remote sensing can support precision farming. They
    can

    be used to obtain periodic information from the ﬁeld, i.e., stock evaluation,
    plant health

    and vegetation monitoring.

    Several researchers examined the chances of applying IoT systems to govern crop

    health and irrigation monitoring. Automated water irrigation was innovated and
    employed

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    15 of 25

    by mobile applications [215]. The designed smartphone application can process
    and de-

    velop the soil images near the root surface of plants to ascertain sensor-less
    water quality. A

    smart drip irrigation method was established using an ARM9 processor, involving
    environ-

    mental conditions including CO2 amount, low moisture, and high temperature [216].
    Zaier

    et al. [217] suggested an irrigation system controlled wirelessly to promote groundwater

    usage in large-scale ﬁelds of Oman. Oksanen et al. [218] stated that big data
    and IoT

    could be used to establish a real-time crop growth monitoring system, facilitating
    precise

    irrigation estimates. Based on the collection of plant data, they suggested establishing
    a

    central unit to develop a crop growth model, Oksanen et al. [218] proposed a method
    to

    forecast and diagnose wheat diseases, weeds, and pests using a computerized IoT-based

    method. A fungicide and insecticide management system based on predictive models
    for

    pests and crop diseases has also been developed using the IoT [219]. A new irrigation

    method based on the IoT was proposed by [220] where humidity sensors were applied,

    and high humidity values of 90–95% were recorded (Table 2).

    4.2. Forecasting Smart Irrigation Technology with DSSIS

    A decision support system (DSS) is an interactive software-based system used to

    identify, analyze, and improve decisions based on raw data, documents, and personal

    knowledge [99]. Various decision support systems (DSSs) have been designed for
    managing

    irrigation water to improve WUE [230,231]. A smart and efﬁcient DSS has to consider

    several factors, such as soil water status, crop type, irrigation method, weather
    information,

    and application, to develop irrigation scheduling [19]. To facilitate precise
    irrigation

    scheduling by minimizing errors in ﬁeld soil moisture estimates, DSSs provide
    irrigation

    schedules not only for the current day but also to forecast irrigation events
    for future days.

    Based on the idea of forecasting irrigation, recently a prototype of an irrigation
    schedul-

    ing DSS called decision support system for irrigation scheduling (DSSIS) has been
    devel-

    oped for arid regions [232]. This DSSIS has the ability to predict irrigation
    events for the

    current day as well as forecast irrigation for the future by using the weather
    information

    of the next 4 days. The DSSIS prototype consists of irrigation pipelines, software
    and

    hardware to control irrigation and peripheral equipment The irrigation pipelines
    consist

    of a drip irrigation system, valves and polyvinyl chloride pipes. The software
    controlling

    the irrigation system includes RZWQM2 (Root Zone Water Quality Model) integrated

    with an irrigation scheduling software (RZ Irrsch and an online weather data acquisition

    system [233]. The irrigation-controlling hardware contains automatic control equipment.

    A peripheral equipment consists of a water reservoir, circulating pumps, and strainers.

    In DSSIS, the RZWQM2 model works as an engine and facilitates decision-making
    about

    irrigation scheduling. The RZWQM2 is ﬁrst calibrated and validated according to
    site-

    speciﬁc experimental data (crop, weather, and soil data). The IrrSch software
    generates

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    16 of 25

    daily weather data from the nearby weather stations and also forecasts upcoming
    4-day

    weather using a weather application program interface (API) then transfer this
    information

    to RZWQM2 [99].

    Based on the information given by IrrSch, RZWQM2 predicts crop evapotranspiration,

    soil water stress factor (SWFAC), and soil moisture content for the current and
    next 4 days.

    When the current day’s water stress level falls below the preset threshold, an
    irrigation

    event is initiated. The amount of water to be supplied is computed by RZWQM2 using

    ﬁeld capacity and the predicted soil water content and rooting depth. This system
    (DSSIS)

    has been tested for cotton irrigation scheduling under full, deﬁcit, experience,
    and sensor-

    based irrigation treatments in an arid region. Under deﬁcit irrigation, DSSIS
    saved 50% of

    irrigation water with a 4% increase in yield and up to 80% increase in water productivity

    over experience-based irrigation [232]. In another study, Chen et al. [234] evaluated
    the

    effect of irrigation scheduling by DSSIS on water productivity, seed cotton yield,
    and

    economic proﬁtability under an arid desert climate. Under DSSIS, water productivity,
    seed

    cotton yield, and economic beneﬁt were higher than soil moisture sensor-based
    irrigation

    scheduling. Full irrigation DSS also maintained crop yield under deﬁcit irrigation
    treatment.

    In a three-year ﬁeld study, Chen et al. [233] evaluated irrigation water use efﬁciency
    (IWUE)

    in cotton using the RZWQM2 model with DSSIS in an arid oasis. After validation,
    the

    RZWQM2 model was run with seven irrigation scenarios (from 850 to 350 mm water),

    and the long-term weather data (1990–2019) were used to estimate the best IWUE.
    The

    results manifested that the irrigation with 660 mm water produced the highest
    seed cotton

    yield (4.09 Mg ha−1), whereas irrigation with 550 mm water exhibited the highest
    IWUE

    (6.53 kg ha−1mm−1). These ﬁndings provided important guidelines for farmers to
    use

    deﬁcit irrigation strategies. This will also help the farmers to develop and improve
    irrigation

    scheduling strategies with respect to their speciﬁc crop production settings.

    This irrigation forecasting DSSIS has been tested on a small scale in an arid
    oasis and

    provided satisfactory results regarding water productivity. It could be promoted
    over a

    large scale. To further improve the site-speciﬁc irrigation management, the soil
    textural

    variability could be analyzed and a local-level soil database could be developed
    through

    extensive soil sampling and analysis. This soil database could be integrated with
    DSSIS for

    scheduling irrigation for a speciﬁc ﬁeld. This concept of irrigation is termed
    soil test-based

    irrigation prescription (STIP). Availability of site-speciﬁc soil information
    may result in

    potential gains in improved WUE and higher proﬁtability in arid regions where
    existing

    irrigation strategies are poorly connected with local agronomic and biophysical
    settings.

    Hence, development of the STIP concept could be a way forward to improve WUE and

    further strengthen efforts to conserve and efﬁciently utilize the limited water
    resources in

    arid and hyperarid regions.

    5. Future Prospects

    This paper presented an overview of advanced and smart irrigation practices for

    improving WUE in water-limited regions, but still there are some challenges that
    are

    important to consider for designing smart, sustainable and user-friendly irrigation
    systems.

    I.

    Variability in soil texture is a vital source of uncertainty because it inﬂuences
    the

    current and potential soil water storage estimates both vertically and latterly
    in a

    ﬁeld. Therefore, site-speciﬁc soil analysis is one way to rectify this problem
    and obtain

    the exact soil parameter information needed for accurate irrigation scheduling.
    Site-

    speciﬁc soil test-based information integrated with smart irrigation systems can
    help

    to improve WUE in arid and semiarid regions. This method is called soil test-based

    irrigation prescription (STIP). The proper execution of STIP needs speciﬁc ﬁeld
    soil

    sampling, analysis of soil properties and development of a soil database. This
    soil

    information with crop and weather data can be integrated with a model or decision

    support system to forecast an irrigation event.

    II.

    Most of the experiments related to smart irrigation systems were conducted on
    a

    small scale in research ﬁelds or under controlled environmental conditions, which

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2113

    17 of 25

    cannot represent commercial farming practices. Therefore, more on-farm studies
    in

    large ﬁelds are needed for a clear understanding about the implementation of smart

    irrigation technology.

    III.

    Most of the commercial smart irrigation systems offered by different irrigation
    com-

    panies help to improve water use efﬁciency, but the high cost of these state-of-the-art

    devices is a serious challenge for farmers. Moreover, these commercial smart irrigation

    systems are custom-built, meaning difﬁculty in control and adaptability. Therefore,

    affordable and user-friendly equipment should be manufactured at a local level.

    IV.

    Most of the farmers in dryland regions are not well educated and should be trained

    through practical demonstration of smart irrigation systems by expert extension
    work-

    ers. Furthermore, governments should provide subsidies to farmers for dissemination

    of such technologies on a large scale.

    6. Conclusions

    This article provided an overview of the major constraints to agricultural productivity,

    traditional irrigation scheduling methods, and efforts and advancements that have
    been

    achieved to enhance WUE, conserve water, and most importantly guarantee food security

    through the adoption of different smart irrigation approaches in dryland regions.
    Dryland

    agriculture is largely affected by low WUE because farmers are relying upon traditional

    irrigation scheduling methods, resulting in over- and/or under-irrigation of ﬁelds
    and

    yield reduction. In this situation, adoption of smart irrigation approaches or
    technologies

    including artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning (ANN, fuzzy logic, expert system,
    hybrid

    intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, VRI
    technology,

    and UAVs could ensure high water use efﬁciency and productivity in water-scarce
    regions.

    These technologies consider several factors, including soil and climate variation,
    soil

    structure and hydraulic properties, plant responses to water deﬁcits, and changes
    in

    weather factors to apply the right amount of water at the right time and place.
    However,

    all these methods face some challenges regarding accurate execution and performance

    under ﬁeld conditions, which could be rectiﬁed by incorporating indigenous knowledge

    and through practical demonstrations to the farmers. Smart irrigation technologies
    are

    revolutionizing global agriculture. Such technologies are highly desirable to
    achieve the

    SDGs and improve the living standards of poor farmers in drylands.

    Italy SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [15] and the billions
    of sensors that will be deployed in the next decade [5], as well as novel associated
    technological breakthroughs, have been enabling the emergence of a new breed of
    smart applications and services for the benefic or our society in different domains
    or verticals, such as smart farming, smart cities, smart healthcare and smart
    industries. Building interoperable IoT services and applications requires a set
    of middleware components and system development, deployment and operation tools
    and platforms, In order to avoid developing extremely focused and vertical IoT
    applications not able to interact with other applications, common and generic
    middleware services used by different application domains become necessary. The
    widespread availability of IoT-based applications requires adequate platforms
    for both development and operation phases. The former for releasing developers
    from the need of mastering different technologies outside their core business
    and that do not add value to the process [7]. The latter for freeing organizations
    from the need of deploying and testing customized platforms for supporting the
    operation of IoT-based applications. There are some IoT platforms available today,
    both open source and proprietary [4]. There is a tradeoff in the deployment of
    such platforms, which traditionally are hosted in cloud datacenters, but are slowly
    considered to be partially moved to edge infrastructure closer to the users, which
    is known as fog computing [2]. Although many IoT platforms exist today, the arena
    is not clear regarding the suitability of them for the different deployment scenarios
    for different smart applications. IoT tools and platforms must provide an end-to-end
    treatment for the data path, since data is generated by sensors, transmitted to
    the storage place, processed by smart algorithms, decisions are made, which fire
    actions that are finally forwarded to actuators as commands aimed at changing
    some configuration. Also, scalability is a major concern for IoT platforms. It
    has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect system
    scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in an environment
    composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting data [16].
    Currently, there is no scalable de facto open IoT platform but the European Commission
    is pushing FIWARE to fill this gap. The SWAMP project develops and assesses an
    IoT-based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture
    with a hands-on approach that focuses on pilots in Italy, Spain and Brazil [9].
    The same underlying platform can be customized to different pilots considering
    different countries, climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP platform may be implemented
    in a range of deployment configurations involving both cloud and fog environments.
    In this paper, we analyze the performance of FIWARE under different platform configurations
    comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios for precision irrigation using one
    of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation scenario. Experiments consisted simulated
    sensors sending messages to FIWARE, deployed both in a fog/cloud and a cloud-only
    configuration mode. We performed experiments with a large number of probes simultaneously
    sending messages to the platform, in order to verify and understand it scalability.
    Security and privacy aspects are key components for making it possible to emergence
    of a true market for such IoT platforms for precision irrigation, such as SWAMP
    [8]. However, these aspects have not been evaluated here since they are outside
    the scope of this paper that focuses on performance and scalability of the FIWARE
    Platform when configured for the needs of SWAMP. Our results reveal interesting
    and non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing does not always improve
    the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition of a fog processing
    nodes even proved to worsen the performance. An important and unexpected factor
    in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially, we believed that
    the network would equally impact both configurations (fog/cloud and cloud-only).
    However, the impact was much higher in the fog/cloud configuration. In the remainder
    of the paper, section II presents background and related work. Section III introduces
    SWAMP and the two scenarios for the MATOPIBA pilot. Section IV provides a detailed
    view of research design and methods. The key results are presented in section
    V, followed by discussion of lessons learned in section VI. Finally, section VII
    draws some conclusions and propose relevant future work. SECTION II. Background
    and Related Work This section introduces related background and related work.
    A. IoT and Fog Computing Fog computing is a fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing
    with challenges related to the huge amount of data that inevitably will be generated
    with the increasing utilization of IoT-based systems [2]. It solves serious problems
    such as decreasing latency from real time applications, decreasing data traffic
    between the network edge and core, and softening the processing burden of the
    cloud by performing load balancing. The metaphor comes from the fact that fog
    is a cloud but closer to the ground and to the people [13]. The fog is based on
    a highly virtualized platform that provides computing, storage and communication
    services between users and the datacenter where the cloud is hosted [1], by bringing
    services from the cloud closer to the users. Since its inception the fog has been
    envisioned for operating together with the cloud for making it possible to implement
    IoT-based smart applications. In other words, fog and IoT are related yet independent
    concepts, as the fog can deal with a broader variety of applications and IoT does
    need the fog to come true. A new technological trend that has been used for implementing
    the fog is container-based virtualization that provides a lightweight alternative
    to the traditional hypervisors [12]. Containers do not emulate the underlying
    hardware. Rather, the virtualized OS communicates directly with the host OS, which
    makes the appropriate calls to the real hardware. Lightweight virtualization minimizes
    the use of computational resources of the host machine, since there is no need
    to duplicate the operating system. B. The FIWARE Platform The FIWARE platform
    (fiware.org) has been attraction general attention for being a worldwide open
    source solution fostered and funded by the European Commission under Horizon 2020
    program. It is comprised of a series of software components called Generic Enablers
    (GE) that perform functions needed in a different variety of IoT-based applications
    for smart societies, focusing in cities, farming, industry, healthcare and sustainability.
    GEs can be used to build different applications that exchange information through
    a REST API following the OMA NGSI standard (openmobilealliance.org/release/NGSI),
    based on JSON. The central aspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information
    model is the concept of entities and their attributes. Among the many GEs available
    by the FIWARE, some are considered the key enablers for smart applications. Here
    we only introduce the ones cited and used in our paper. Orion Context Broker:
    Orion is a publish/subscribe context broker, which makes it the main FIWARE GE
    and the heart of the platform. Orion provides an interface where clients can register
    entities and their attributes as well as producers/consumers of those entities.
    Orion only stores the latest version of entity attributes and it needs to work
    together with other GEs or applications in order to maintain historical data.
    Orion is available in fiware-orion.readthedocs.io. IDAS and IoT Agents: IDAS is
    an implementation of the Device Backend Management GE that comprises many IoT
    Agents that map data coming from sensors and going to actuators to the FIWARE
    NGSI information model to be stored in Orion and further processed by other GEs
    or external applications. Since low power sensors do not possess computing, storage
    and transmission capabilities for speaking NGSI, they use different IoT protocols
    such as MQTT, CoAP, Ultralight or LoRaWAN transport, which are converted into/from
    NGSI by IoT Agents. IDAS is available in catalogueserver.fiware.org/enablers/backend-device-managementidas.
    STH Comet: Short Time Historic, also known as Comet, works with Orion storing
    entity data as a time series that can be further used by applications or other
    GEs. STH Comet is available in fiware-sth-comet.readthedocs.io. The use of FIWARE
    by any organization or developer involves the installation of its GEs in an appropriate
    infrastructure where it can run, which might be standalone machines, public clouds
    or preferentially a private cloud using the OpenStack cloud manager. FIWARE has
    been used as a computing platform for many IoT-based applications, such as farming
    and environment [14]. Also, many large scale projects use FIWARE for IoT in agriculture,
    such as IoF2020 (iof2020.eu), as well as startups such as Breeze (breeze-technologies.de),
    Hop Ubiquitous (hopu.eu) and Agricolus (agricolus.com). C. Related Work Scalability
    is a major concern for IoT platforms. Numbers vary but in general it is forecasted
    that in the beginning of the 2020’s there will be about 30 billion connected devices
    [5]. It has been shown that different architectural choices of IoT platforms affect
    system scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in
    an environment composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting
    data [16]. The performance of FIWARE has been calling the attention its user community.
    A comprehensive study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates
    the performance of various IoT platforms is presented by da Cruz et al. (2018)
    [4]. From 11 platforms analyzed by the qualitative approach, 5 were selected for
    the quantitative performance analysis, including FIWARE. However, since they adopted
    a generic approach, they did not go into the specifics of FIWARE-only a single
    Orion + STH platform configuration was considered – and they did not evaluate
    different infrastructures (as fog computing). Martínez et al. (2016) [11] gives
    a detailed description of the architecture of a testbed of the FIWARE platform
    configured for the precision agriculture domain, which differs from our approach,
    because their test application connects directly to FIWARE using NGSI JSON interface,
    while we included an IoT Agent for MQTT using a scalable IoT sensor simulator
    for generating synthetic data. Lastly, Cardoso et al. (2017) [3] compared the
    performance of FIWARE and their own implementation of ETSI M2M, under different
    running conditions, which makes it difficult to understand the tradeoffs of each
    platform. In this paper, we differ from previous work by evaluating five configurations
    of FIWARE and focusing on the scenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture from
    the SWAMP project [9]. SECTION III. Smart Water Management Platform The primary
    objective of the SWAMP project is to develop IoT based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in precision irrigation domain and to pilot them in
    four places, two pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil [9],
    more information can be found in swampproject.org. Also, it is aimed at improving
    precision irrigation by increasing the awareness of the condition of the crop,
    by monitoring the field based on crop status and environment, and to adjust the
    irrigation prescription map accordingly. A. SWAMP Pilots The four SWAMP pilots
    are based on the similar technical solutions and deal with different crops and
    have different primary goals. CBEC Pilot (Bologna/Italy): the main objective of
    the Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia Centrale (CBEC) pilot is optimizing water distribution
    to the farms. Intercrop Pilot (Cartagena/Spain): Intercrop Iberica addresses several
    challenges since production is in a dry area and its primary goal is making a
    rational use of water. Guaspari Pilot (Espírito Santo do Pinhal / Brazil): The
    Guaspari Winery transfers the wine grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August)
    using irrigation techniques. The main goal for Guaspari is improving wine quality.
    MATOPIBA Pilot (Barreiras/Brazil): The Rio das Pedras Farm is located in the MATOPIBA
    region, and irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. The main pilot goal
    is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable Rate
    Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production and save energy used
    in irrigation. The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation
    system concept for agriculture. The fundamental idea is to enable optimizations
    of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption based on a holistic analysis
    that collects information from all aspects of the system including even the natural
    water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related to growing particular plants.
    It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees the availability of water
    in situations where water supply is limited and also prevents over- and under-irrigation.
    A fundamental idea in SWAMP is to facilitate the replication of water management
    systems built on top of its platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment.
    Different layers of the architecture have components that are more generic and
    thus less difficult to be ported to other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific
    and thus require new development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. B.
    SWAMP MATOPIBA Scenario In this paper we will evaluate the performance of FIWARE
    when configured for the SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario depicted in Fig. 1 , which represents
    the center-pivot with variable-rate irrigation pilot. The scenario captures both
    the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents a future vision and not
    the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular agricultural plot of
    100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot is further divided
    into different management zones, identified before the crop season and based on
    differences in the soil properties. Two general types of sensors collect data
    for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within the soil at the root system
    depth that continuously measure metrics such as temperature and moisture, and;
    b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral cameras
    or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to the farm’s
    office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control the variable
    rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped with processing
    and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is predicted for
    the sensing devices. We developed multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which
    include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity sensors at three depths
    from the soil surface. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted from a
    few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. The key difference between
    Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) is that the former includes a distributed fog/cloud configuration
    of the platform whereas the latter is solely based on the cloud for hosting all
    software components. Depending on different variables - such as farmers interest,
    availability of infrastructure, intended responsiveness to delay, robustness to
    disconnections, and cost/effectiveness – one or the other scenario may be more
    or less appropriate. For the MATOPIBA pilot, the preferred solution is the fog-based
    one, for providing autonomous processing capacity to the farm as it is located
    in a region where Internet connections may suffer periods of instability. Anyway,
    we evaluate both approaches because the cloud-based one might be used as well.
    In Fig. 1(a) both the center pivot and drones are deemed Field Fog Nodes (FFN)
    for the SWAMP architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor
    aggregation point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the
    SWAMP system. FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the
    SWAMP platform, which usually is an on-premises Typically, when sensors are powered
    with LoRaWAN, the FFN will host the LoRaWAN Gateway and possibly the LoRaWAN Server
    and other supplementary features. The Fog Hub is located in the farm’s office.
    SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with the platform running in the cloud,
    whenever this is the preferred deployment choice. The FFNs send data directly
    to the SWAMP platform located in the Fog Hub at the farm’s offices via different
    wireless technologies, which in Fig. 1(a) is WiFi. For this scenario, the functions
    performed by the SWAMP architecture are divided up into local fog and remote cloud
    components. Heavy processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart
    algorithms (i.e., machine learning), is performed in the cloud. External information
    is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological data and historical
    data. On the other hand, Fig. 1(b) depicts a scenario where no fog is available
    and data generated by sensors are sent directly to the cloud via a typical cellular
    technology that might be 3G/4G or even NB-IoT. Fig. 1. SWAMP MATOPIBA scenario;
    a) Fog-cloud; b) Cloud-only Show All SECTION IV. Research Design and Methods A.
    Evaluation Scenario and Environment One of the main goals of this paper is to
    compare fog/cloud and cloud-only based approaches for smart water management.
    Therefore, based on the SWAMP MATOPIBA pilot specification ( Section 3), we designed
    a FIWARE-based IoT platform that involves obtaining sensor data values up to the
    point of they are transparently consumed by an application that can be deployed
    in the cloud and/or in the fog. The software modules depicted in Fig.3 and Fig.4
    are implemented by lightweight virtualization of Docker containers, including
    the FIWARE modules, whose container images can easily be obtained in that format.
    The other modules of this scenario are: SenSE: the Sensor Simulating Environment
    (SenSE, is an open-source large-scale IoT sensor data generator able to abstract
    real devices and to model different complex scenarios, such as smart farms [16].
    The tool is a traffic workload generator that emulates a huge number of heterogeneous
    sensors representing tens of thousands of IoT sensors sending data simultaneously
    via a typical IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT). Although the sensors are synthetic, the
    traffic is real. In our scenarios, SenSE generates probe data and represents the
    fog field node that forward sensor data to the platform. The source code can be
    download from github.com/ivanzy/SenSE-Sensor-Simulation-Environment. Mosquitto:
    Eclipse Mosquitto is an open source MQTT message broker. Available in mosquitto.org.
    MongoDB: a document-oriented NoSQL database. Available in mongodb.com. Consumer:
    Consumer is a special purpose Express.js web application that subscribes in Orion
    and receives sensor data from the probes. When Orion sends a message to the consumer’s
    API, a timestamp is recorded and is subtracted from the timestamp of the message,
    in such a way we obtain the elapsed time between the generation of the message
    until it reaches the Consumer. The sequence of processing steps and data flow
    starting from the sensor data generation and ending at the consumer is shown in
    Fig. 2. This data flow is deployed in both fog and cloud-only scenarios, depicted
    in Fig. 1. SenSE generates sensor (probe) data and sends it to Mosquitto MQTT
    broker; IoT Agent receives the probe messages from the MQTT broker, stores it
    in MongoDB, translates them to the NGSI format, and finally sends it to Orion
    through HTTP protocol; Orion Context Broker receives NGSI data from the IoT Agent,
    updates entity values, stores them in MongoDB, and sends them to the subscribed
    applications through HTTP protocol and structured as NGSI; Data is delivered to
    the consumer, which stores it and calculates the elapsed since the message was
    generated in the probe (by SenSE), the consumer is subscribed to be notified from
    all probe sensors updates. Fig. 2. Processing steps and data flow Show All In
    the cloud-only experiments ( Fig.3) the sensor data is directed sent to the cloud,
    where all modules are in the same physical machine. Since both Orion and IoT Agent
    are in the same VM, both use the same MongoDB instance. In the fog experiments,
    the first two steps of processing occur in the fog node, which means that the
    MQTT broker and the IoT Agent run in the edge device, and the Orion and Consumer
    are executed in a VM in the cloud. This configuration needs a MongoDB instance
    in each machine, where the fog hosts the IoT Agent and cloud hosts Orion and the
    Consumer. In order to fully understand the evaluation scenario, one needs to comprehend
    the data model of the probe messages. We adopted the Ultralight 2.0 (UL) protocol
    – a lightweight text based protocol aimed to constrained devices and communications
    where the bandwidth and device memory may be limited resources [6]. Each probe
    consists of a set of seven sensors of three different types: Three soil temperature
    sensors in different depths; Three soil moisture sensors in different depths;
    One soil electrical conductivity sensor. Each probe sends a message every 10 minutes
    using the UL protocol over MQTT. The structure of each message is: t1|v|t2|v|t3|v|m1|v|m2|v|m3|v|c|v|ts|v
    View Source where: t1, t2, t3: temperature sensors in different depths; m1, m2,
    m3: moisture sensors in different depths; c: electrical conductivity of the soil;
    ts: timestamp of message generation; v: value of the metric. Fig.3 and Fig.4 show
    the two evaluation scenarios, cloud-only and fog/cloud, respectively. We performed
    the experiments in a lab testbed – all the VMs in the same LAN - and using a network
    emulator (WANem – available to download at wanem.sourceforge.net) to consider
    the impact of network parameters between the place where the data is generated
    (in the farm, where the sensors and fog nodes are located) and the place it is
    processed (the cloud, usually located in some datacenters placed in big cities).
    Although the case where the machines representing the fog and the cloud are in
    the same LAN does not adequately portray the reality, it is important to further
    understand the behavior of the IoT platform and what are the impacts of a constrained
    network. Fig. 3. Cloud/Only FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All Fig. 4. Fog/Cloud FIWARE-SWAMP Evaluation Scenarios – with and without
    WAN Show All The experiments were performed in a private cloud environment implemented
    with OpenStack in a lab testbed. As the experiments were in our own private cloud,
    we could assure that they did not suffer from outside interference from other
    virtual machines running in the same physical servers. Both fog and cloud were
    implemented using virtual machines (VM) in OpenStack, though with very different
    configurations. We used the standard Amazon AWS VM configurations: cloud VM equivalent
    to a t2.medium instance (2vCPU - 4GB of RAM) and the fog VMs (both fog field node
    and fog hub) equivalent to a t2.small instance (1vCPU – 2 GB RAM). Our cloud was
    composed by 6 machines with the following configuration: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
    E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40GHz - 8 cores and GB of RAM. Two different physical machines
    were used. B. Metrics There are two different metric used in our experiments:
    Average elapsed time: the average time elapsed since a sensor data point is generated
    in the probe until it reaches the consumer application. Basically, we are interested
    in the time elapsed since the data is collected until it is ready to be used by
    another application – such as a dashboard or an analytics module; System metrics:
    CPU and memory usage per Docker container, which allows us to observed each application,
    obtained by docker stats command every 5 seconds. C. Experiments Experiments consisted
    of SenSE simulating probes and sending messages to the IoT platform, running in
    the cloud-only configuration or in the fog/cloud configuration. We performed experiments
    with a large number of probes simultaneously sending messages to the platform,
    in order to verify and understand it scalability. Table I shows the factors and
    levels used in the performance analysis. Our experiments varied all factors with
    all levels, consisting of 16 different possibilities. Each experiment took 2 minutes
    and was replicated 30 times, totalizing 16 hours of running experiments. The asymptotic
    confidence intervals were calculated with a confidence level of 99%. Table I Factors
    and Levels To configure the emulated WAN, we tried to replicate a connection from
    a farm to a cloud. Therefore, we made a simple experiment in order to obtain the
    parameters used in the network emulator by pinging a public cloud using a 4G connection,
    and next we estimated the parameters as a 10 Mbps connection with 45ms of delay
    time and 5ms of jitter. SECTION V. Results The results for the elapsed time in
    all configurations are depicted in Fig.5, wherein one can observe the effect of
    increasing the workload in the fog/cloud and cloud-only scenarios. The platform
    remained stable during almost all experiments, except for the ones performed with
    a workload of 15,000 probes - that we consider being a very high workload. The
    high confidence interval in those experiments reveals this instability. Regarding
    the comparison between the experiments with the presence of the fog and the ones
    with only the cloud, it is essential to analyze networking issues. First we analyze
    those configurations without the network effects (no WANEm emulator), and next
    the impact of the WAN in the experiments. It is important to reinforce that experiments
    without considering the impact of the network are only for a baseline comparison
    and do not reflect real scenarios. In the experiments using a local network, the
    two approaches had equivalent results, since neither the fog nor the cloud were
    overloaded. The difference between the two approaches –fog and cloud - is that
    in the fog case some software modules (Docker containers) were moved to another
    machine (representing the fog), there was no improvement in the overall performance
    of the system when the cloud was not overloaded. Therefore, our experiments revealed
    that performing load balancing between two different machines does not improve
    the performance of the system. In the case where the cloud is overloaded (15,000
    probes), distributing the processing to another machine (the fog) should have
    improved the overall performance of the system. However, the results show that
    there is an overlap between the confidence interval of the experiments with fog
    and cloud with 15000 probes, with the fog experiments having a slightly better
    performance. This occurs due to the limited computational resources of the machine
    that represents the edge device, so that when the workload increases the fog node
    becomes the bottleneck. Experiments with the network emulator (WANem) had results
    that did not confirm our intuition. In the scenarios with a low workload (1,000
    and 5,000 probes), the cloud approach has a significant better performance than
    the fog. This occurs because in the cloud experiments the network traffic was
    composed of small MQTT packets, which did not impose a major constrain to the
    network. However, in the fog experiments the MQTT traffic is only send to the
    fog, which sends a very verbose NGSI/HTTP traffic via the network to the cloud.
    This traffic suffers much more with the network constrains (latency and limited
    bandwidth). Anyway, there is a clear trade-off between the cloud and fog approaches
    when processing becomes the bottleneck, instead of the network. The almost perfect
    balance occurs with experiments with 10,000 probes, in which both approaches achieved
    the same performance. For higher workloads, the fog has a slightly better performance
    than the cloud. The system metrics – RAM and CPU usage - for the cloud-only experiments
    are depicted in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, for the fog/cloud experiments are showed in
    Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Since the workload in the system is very similar with and without
    the network, we opted to portrait only the results performed considering the network,
    since they illustrate the whole set of experiments. The experiments using the
    fog approach, there were two MongoDB instances - in the fog to help the IoT Agent
    and in the cloud connected to Orion - are identified as Mongo-fog and Mongo-cloud
    respectively. Analyzing Fig. 6 and Fig. 8, it becomes clear that the container
    that demands more processing and it is the potential bottleneck of the system
    is MongoDB. Also, when comparing the cloud-only and fog/cloud results for the
    CPU usage, it is possible to infer that Orion imposes a higher workload in, since
    when the IoT Agent is on the fog node, MongoDB in the cloud has only an approximately
    20% decrease of CPU usage. Unlike the CPU usage, the memory usage has a stable
    behavior, even with the increase of the workload, as shown by Fig.7 for the cloud
    experiments, and in Fig. 9 for the fog experiments. However, there is also a decrease
    of approximately 20% of memory usage when the IoT-Agent is moved to the fog, with
    its own instance of MongoDB. Fig. 5. Response time for the cloud and fog configurations

    SECTION VI. Discussion The experiments were successful in replicating a large-scale
    smart farm environment considering the number of sensors. Also, they showed that
    fog computing does not always improve the overall system performance. However,
    there are complex issues to evaluated in opting for a cloud or a fog approach
    beyond simply adding a machine in the edge of the network. There is a non-trivial
    trade-off between the given application, the available infrastructure and the
    system workload. In the SWAMP scenarios, we expect a smaller number of sensors,
    due to costs and farm sizes, and therefore the experiments that better represent
    real case scenarios are the ones with 1,000 and 5,000 probes. In those cases,
    the addition of a fog processing node proved to be a downgrade regarding performance.
    Nevertheless, the fog has others benefits that compensate the lack of performance.
    In farms in the inward countryside of Brazil, when there is Internet connectivity,
    it is frequently unstable and limited, suffering from frequent disconnections.
    In this case, the fog node is responsible to store sensor data and keep a subset
    of services online when there is no connection to the Internet. An important and
    unexpected factor in the experiments was the impact of the network. Initially,
    we believed that the network would equally impact both configurations fog and
    cloud). However, the impact was much higher in the fog configuration. This happens
    because the traffic of JSON/HTTP packets suffer more from network constrains than
    the lightweight UL 2.0 MQTT traffic. Therefore, when deploying a solution in a
    real environment, there is the need to analyze if the gain in processing part
    of the data in another device (the fog) will overcome the limitations imposed
    by the network. Another solution is to use a lightweight protocol when sending
    the data to the cloud form the fog. This set of experiments created higher awareness
    about the scalability tradeoffs of the FIWARE IoT platform. A major concern is
    regarding the default database used by Orion and the IoT Agent (i.e. MongoDB)
    that was the major bottleneck of the experiments. It is a known fact that MongoDB
    does scale as well as other NoSQL databases, such as Cassandra [10]. In the FIWARE
    documentation, there is no guide or configuration regarding using a different
    database for both software and it seems that they were hardcoded for working with
    MongoDB. FIWARE could potentially increase its scalability if it allows the of
    more efficient databases other than MongoDB. Another solution is to place MongoDB
    in a dedicated machine. Although FIWARE has a scalability ceiling due to MongoDB,
    it is suitable for most of the IoT scenarios in smart farms, being capable to
    handle 10,000 probes without major performance issues. It is proven to be a reliable
    tool with several advantages. It provides a standard communication format between
    all services in a given system through the NGSI information model. FIWARE also
    provides a transparent way to applications – such as dashboards and analytics
    – to consume sensor data. The IoT Agent can handle data from different sensors
    and translate them to a standard NGSI and automatically send this data to Orion,
    whose API is very flexible and able to add new sensors on-the-fly. Orion also
    proved to be a reliable and useful tool to manage context information, as it stores
    the last data point of each attribute and provides a simple API to consult it.
    Also, by using the subscribe operation in Orion, applications do not need to perform
    polling in the interesting devices. Rather, when data is changed, Orion notifies
    the subscribed application. SECTION VII. Conclusion We analyzed the performance
    of FIWARE under different platform configurations comparing fog/cloud and cloud-only
    scenarios for precision irrigation using one of the SWAMP pilots as the evaluation
    scenario. Our results reveal non-intuitive outcomes, such as, that fog computing
    does not always improve the overall system performance. In some cases, the addition
    of a fog processing nodes even proved to worsen the performance. Also, the network
    between the farm and the cloud datacenter causes some unexpected differences between
    different scenarios. The results presented in this paper reveal the tip of the
    iceberg. In order to fully understand the tradeoffs involved in using IoT platforms
    and particularly FIWARE, we need to broaden our scope and perform experiments
    in different configurations, pilots and in scenarios beyond smart farming. Authors

    \ A Case Study in Calabria”\npublished in the Proceedings of the Italian Conference\
    \ on Geomatics and Geospatial Technologies, Genoa,\nItaly, 1–23 July 2021.\nAbstract:\
    \ Geomatics is important for agriculture 4.0; in fact, it uses different types\
    \ of data (remote\nsensing from satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles-UAVs, GNSS,\
    \ photogrammetry, laser scanners\nand other types of data) and therefore it uses\
    \ data fusion techniques depending on the different\napplications to be carried\
    \ out. This work aims to present on a study area concerning the integration\n\
    of data acquired (using data fusion techniques) from remote sensing techniques,\
    \ UAVs, autonomous\ndriving machines and data fusion, all reprocessed and visualised\
    \ in terms of results obtained through\nGIS (Geographic Information System). In\
    \ this work we emphasize the importance of the integration\nof different methodologies\
    \ and data fusion techniques, managing data of a different nature acquired\nwith\
    \ different methodologies to optimise vineyard cultivation and production. In\
    \ particular, in\nthis note we applied (focusing on a vineyard) geomatics-type\
    \ methodologies developed in other\nworks and integrated here to be used and optimised\
    \ in order to make a contribution to agriculture\n4.0. More speciﬁcally, we used\
    \ the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) applied to\nmultispectral\
    \ satellite images and drone images (suitably combined) to identify the vigour\
    \ of the\nplants. We then used an autonomous guided vehicle (equipped with sensors\
    \ and monitoring systems)\nwhich, by estimating the optimal path, allows us to\
    \ optimise fertilisation, irrigation, etc., by data\nfusion techniques using various\
    \ types of sensors. Everything is visualised on a GIS to improve the\nmanagement\
    \ of the ﬁeld according to its potential, also using historical data on the environmental,\n\
    climatic and socioeconomic characteristics of the area. For this purpose, experiments\
    \ of different\ntypes of Geomatics carried out individually on other application\
    \ cases have been integrated into\nthis work and are coordinated and integrated\
    \ here in order to provide research/application cues for\nAgriculture 4.0.\nKeywords:\

    \ networks\n1. Introduction\nAs the concept of digital transformation is making\
    \ its way into all ﬁelds of daily life,\nrevolutionizing the way we produce and\
    \ interact, the applications of digital technologies\ntend to “specialize” in\
    \ individual application sectors. Agriculture is often considered a\n“traditionalist”\
    \ sector uninclined to changes; however, in recent years, it has beneﬁted\ngreatly\
    \ from the technological evolution underway.\nThe term “industry 4.0” has been\
    \ coined to indicate digital transformation in produc-\ntion environments; in\
    \ the same vein, the entry of the technologies of the fourth industrial\nrevolution\
    \ into the agrifood sector can be called “agriculture 4.0”. Agriculture 4.0 is\
    \ the\nresult of the application of a series of innovative technologies in the\
    \ agrifood ﬁeld and\nSensors 2022, 22, 7910. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22207910\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 7910\n2 of 23\nit can\
    \ be considered as an upgrade of precision agriculture. This was possible thanks\
    \ to\nthe automation of the collection and the integration and analysis of data\
    \ collected directly\nfrom the ﬁelds through various types of sensors. In this\
    \ context, digital technologies 4.0\nare useful to support-thanks to data analysis-the\
    \ farmer in his daily activity and in plan-\nning strategies for his business,\
    \ including relationships with all links in the supply chain,\ngenerating a virtuous\
    \ circle able to create value for the individual company and in cascade\nfor its\
    \ partners. Thanks to these new solutions and the application of digital technologies,\n\
    from the IoT to artiﬁcial intelligence, from the analysis of large amounts of\
    \ data to self-\ndriving tractors to the use of drones, farms can increase proﬁtability\
    \ and the economic,\nenvironmental and social sustainability of its business.\
    \ The beginning of the application of\ntechnologies for precision agriculture\
    \ in Italy dates to the 1990s; basically, it involves using\ndigital solutions\
    \ for speciﬁc interventions, which take into account in particular the needs\n\
    of the soil and plants. The aims of these interventions are to improve the production\
    \ yield\nof the plantations as much as possible and contain costs and environmental\
    \ impact. This\ncategory includes, for example, all interventions to make irrigation\
    \ more efﬁcient without\nwasting water resources or causing the plants to suffer,\
    \ planting technologies adapted to\nthe biochemical and physical characteristics\
    \ of the soil on which the intervention is carried\nout, the administration of\
    \ pesticides commensurate to the speciﬁc needs of each area and\nplant, or of\
    \ fertilizers only in the necessary quantity and at the most useful times.\nFor\
    \ this reason, precision agriculture, in addition to being the predecessor of\
    \ agricul-\nture 4.0, is also one of the cornerstones of the latter, because it\
    \ lays the foundations for\nadapting production processes to individual needs\
    \ thanks to targeted and timely interven-\ntions. All these interventions can\
    \ adapt to the needs of the moment (through GIS, different\ntypes of sensor data,\
    \ and the use of data fusion techniques, production peculiarities can\nalso be\
    \ estimated). The basis for making these technologies more effective is the real-time\n\
    use of data coming from the ﬁelds. Thanks to sensors able transmit information,\
    \ installed\non ﬁelds or agricultural machinery, it will be possible to make timely\
    \ and effective deci-\nsions, which can also be entrusted to automated systems.\
    \ In general, the main advantages\nof agriculture 4.0 are those, as we said, of\
    \ a rationalization of resources, with a positive\neconomic impact for the companies\
    \ in the supply chain. A path of products-from ﬁeld to\ntable-aimed at maximizing\
    \ sustainability also has a positive impact on health, since it will\nbe possible\
    \ to bring better controlled and fresher products to ﬁnal consumers than with\n\
    traditional techniques. To quantify these advantages, there is talk of a saving\
    \ of around 30%\nfor production inputs and a 20% increase in productivity, with\
    \ limited use of chemicals.\nThen focusing on the use of data, it must be added\
    \ that being able to count on the real-time\nanalysis of the information coming\
    \ from the ﬁelds is extremely useful to manage any\nactivity related to agriculture\
    \ in a faster and, therefore, more efﬁcient way. In fact, thanks to\nthe data\
    \ analysis, it will be possible to make the use of agricultural machinery as efﬁcient\n\
    as possible, or to use only the amount of water needed, without waste. Thanks\
    \ to the same\nset of information, it will also be possible to prevent plant diseases\
    \ or counteract pests,\nlimiting damage when problems arise thanks to constant\
    \ and simultaneous monitoring of\ncrops. Moreover, it should be emphasized that\
    \ these are advantages that can be obtained\nregardless of the type of crop.\n\
    This study starts from work previously carried out on a speciﬁc agricultural area,\
    \ with\nthe aim of reanalysis with different tools and techniques in order to\
    \ ﬁnd a more efﬁcient\nmonitoring solution.\nIt is possible to use Geomatics techniques,\
    \ and thus to use satellite images, multi-\nspectral drone images (and there are\
    \ already numerous analyses on the integration of\nsatellite images and drone\
    \ images to improve image quality and productivity), other sen-\nsors (humidity,\
    \ pressure, wind, temperature), merge these data with data fusion techniques,\n\
    manage the use of automated vehicles, and collect everything using GIS to optimise\
    \ the\nagricultural production process (fertilisation, irrigation, etc....) according\
    \ to the needs of\nthe population.\nSensors 2022, 22, 7910\n3 of 23\nThe practice\
    \ of Precision Agriculture (PA) and, recently, Agriculture 4.0, has garnered\n\
    a lot of attention in recent years. Through the integration of information technology\
    \ and\nagronomic practices, it has become possible to automate the management\
    \ of parcels of\nland [1].\nThe literature cited below highlights the research\
    \ questions and useful information\nand underlines the shortcomings of previous\
    \ studies.\nPrecision agriculture is a management strategy [2] that utilizes information\
    \ technology\nto collect data from multiple sources in order to use them in decisions\
    \ regarding ﬁeld\nproduction activities [3]. The goal of this strategy is to integrate\
    \ the ideas of business\nmanagement and process automation. Agriculture 4.0 additionally\
    \ brings together var-\nious innovative methodologies applied from time to time\
    \ in other sectors, such as the\nidentiﬁcation of optimal routes for self-driving\
    \ tractors.\nCrop monitoring, which is based on observations carried out directly\
    \ on crops in place\nin order to obtain data on phenological stages, nutritional\
    \ status [4–6], phytosanitary status,\nproduction expectations [7] and production\
    \ maps [8], is of particular interest in order to\naccomplish this. The monitoring\
    \ of crops relies on observations made directly on the crops\nin their natural\
    \ environment. Since massive amounts of data need to be gathered and\nprocessed,\
    \ process automation is necessary [9].\nThe monitoring of crops makes use of remote\
    \ sensing data and is predicated on the link\nthat exists between several parameters\
    \ relating to the leaf curtain [10]. These parameters\ncan express the vegetative–productive\
    \ responses of plants and evaluate the variability as\na function of the different\
    \ behaviours of surfaces and bodies [11] to the phenomenon of\nabsorption or reﬂection\
    \ of light in the visible and infrared regions [12].\nLarge agricultural regions\
    \ have been monitored using satellite remote sensing ever\nsince the 1970s for\
    \ the purpose of stock forecasting [13], which has resulted in the provision\n\
    of useful data for the industry of agriculture itself. The unique optical behaviour\
    \ of plants\nin the infrared radiation band makes remote sensing techniques particularly\
    \ useful for\nevaluating vegetative health [14], as these techniques are useful\
    \ in practice [15]. The time-\nconsuming and ﬁnancially burdensome ﬂights of airplanes\
    \ ﬁtted with specialized cameras\nwere quickly replaced by satellites that, while\
    \ continuously orbiting the Earth, acquire data\non the electromagnetic emission\
    \ of objects on the Earth’s surface, and consequently also of\nthe crops, with\
    \ their multispectral sensors, if passive, or radar, if active. This has resulted\n\
    in a signiﬁcant reduction in the cost of collecting this information. However,\
    \ passive\nsensors have limitations; acquisition is necessarily diurnal and hindered\
    \ by any cloud cover.\nFurthermore, the level of detail that is obtainable precludes\
    \ performing particular kinds of\nanalyses on smaller parcels of land.\nOn the\
    \ other hand, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to be very\n\
    helpful because they can collect more speciﬁc georeferenced information using\
    \ a variety of\nsensors [16–19].\nIn viticulture in particular, optimising vineyard\
    \ cultivation and yield procedures\nthrough the use of automatic cultivation machines\
    \ and data fusion, which faces challenges\nduring production cycles by deﬁning\
    \ an adequate crop management, the Agriculture 4.0\napproach has as its ultimate\
    \ goal the improvement of vineyard yield and grape quality while\nsimultaneously\
    \ reducing all wastes, costs, and the negative impact on the environment [20].\n\
    The information collected by optical sensors in multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ imag-\ning systems is utilized in the calculation of a diverse range of indices\
    \ related to crop\nproduction (such as the Leaf Area Index (LAI) [15,21]). The\
    \ normalized difference vegeta-\ntion index (NDVI) is one of the indices that\
    \ is utilised the most frequently because of its\nrelationship to crop vigour\
    \ and, as a result of this relationship, to the estimated quantity\nand quality\
    \ of ﬁeld production.\nThe MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) of Sentinel 2 covers\
    \ large areas, and many satellite\nprograms (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2)\
    \ now freely supply datasets, which\npromotes the exploitation of satellite imagery\
    \ for many applications, including agricultural\napplications, as multi-sensor\
    \ and multiresolution data fusion [22–26]. The Sentinel-2\nSensors 2022, 22, 7910\n\
    4 of 23\nsatellite, which was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), has\
    \ a resolution of\none decametre, a revisitation time of six days, and an efﬁcient\
    \ resolution for analysing crop\nvariability and conditions. If, on the other\
    \ hand, we consider crops to be more like orchards\nand vineyards (with breaks\
    \ in their layouts), then remote sensing becomes more challenging.\nActually,\
    \ the occurrence of paths between yields and weedy vegetation within the cultivated\n\
    land can have a noticeable impact on the overall calculation of spectral indices,\
    \ which in\nturn leads to a less precise evaluation of the crop’s status. New\
    \ methods and algorithms\nwere developed that use multispectral information from\
    \ UAVs for circumventing this\ncriticality [27]. These advancements have been\
    \ made in order to resolve this critical issue.\nLow-altitude platforms, as Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with airborne sensors,\ncan differentiate pure canopy\
    \ pixels from other objects by acquiring images with a high\nresolution and having\
    \ ﬂexible ﬂight planning [28]. This allows for the classiﬁcation of\ndetails within\
    \ canopies.\nIn particular, it is possible to successfully combine an unmanned\
    \ rotary-wing platform\nwith a multispectral sensor in order to detect and monitor\
    \ water-stressed areas of orchards,\nvineyards, and olive groves. This is possible\
    \ thanks to the fact that the two technologies\ncan be successfully combined.\n\
    In PA, the NDVI index is a parameter that is used because it is directly related\
    \ to the\nhealth of the vegetation. This allows problems such as a lack of nutrients,\
    \ the presence\nof parasitic infections, or conditions of water stress to be discovered.\
    \ The NDVI index is\ncalculated by processing images that were taken in the infrared.\
    \ The early detection of\nsuch situations enables intervention that is both targeted\
    \ and effective, which results in cost\nsavings and increased crop yield. Infrared\
    \ detection is frequently capable of identifying\nissues well in advance of their\
    \ becoming obvious to the human eye [29,30].\nIn this article we present, among\
    \ other things, a comprehensive vineyard survey\nthat also compares MultiSpectral\
    \ Instrument (MSI) data from a satellite with decametre\nresolution and from a\
    \ low-altitude UAV platform. This allowed us to better understand the\ndifferences\
    \ between the two types of instruments. The performance of Sentinel-2′s MSI,\n\
    WorldVew and the aerial UAV sensors, both with very high resolution, when considering\n\
    the relationship between crop vigour and NDVI was determined. In order to investigate\n\
    the role played by the various vineyard components, satellite data were compared\
    \ with\nUAV images using the following three NDVI indices [31,32]: (i) the entire\
    \ agricultural area;\n(ii) only the vine canopies; and (iii) only the inter-row\
    \ soil. These indices were calculated\nby comparing the UAV data with satellite\
    \ images.\nThe multispectral sensors used on UAVs are capable of recording at\
    \ least three chan-\nnels, as a regular camera would, but one of those channels\
    \ is replaced by infrared. Although\nmultispectral sensors can acquire information\
    \ in more than four bands and multispectral\ncameras are capable of recording\
    \ more than the three channels deﬁned here, for the pur-\nposes of this application,\
    \ each image will consist of two visible colours in addition to\ninfrared [33–36].\
    \ Because of this, the NDVI index can be calculated from a single image\nusing\
    \ a modiﬁed version of the conventional formula. The processing is handled in\
    \ an\nautomated practice by the GIS which we used (QGis). The maps that are obtained\
    \ after\nthe processing are false-colour maps known as “Vigour Maps” [37,38].\
    \ On these maps, red\nrepresents regions that have the highest possible vitality\
    \ [39].\nRecent literature also exists on data fusion techniques for agriculture:\
    \ on input devices\nsynchronised with microcontrollers and sending data from sensors\
    \ via IoT (Internet of\nThings) devices to the cloud [40] and the challenges and\
    \ complexity of Agriculture 4.0 [41].\nIt is obvious that the methodology that\
    \ has been proposed can include other kinds of\ncrops that are grown in rows,\
    \ with crop canopies that do not extend over the entire area of\ncultivation,\
    \ or where there is a signiﬁcant presence of bare soil or grass [42–44].\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 7910\n5 of 23\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Remote Sensing\nRemote\
    \ sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon\nwithout\
    \ coming into physical contact with the object. In this case we will refer to\
    \ Remote\nSensing from Earth Observation by satellite and, although it is used\
    \ in numerous ﬁelds, in\nour case it is used for monitoring purposes in agriculture,\
    \ particularly vineyard cultivation.\nIt is crucial for winemakers to gain an\
    \ accurate understanding of the spatial variability\nboth between and within crops\
    \ to be able to make accurate predictions regarding yield and\nquality. The Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most widely\nused indices because\
    \ it is related to crop vigour and, as a result, to estimated quantity and\nquality\
    \ of ﬁeld production.\nPlants absorb solar radiation in the spectral region via\
    \ photosynthetically active radia-\ntion (PAR), which they then use as an energy\
    \ source in the photosynthesis process. Strong\nabsorption at these wavelengths\
    \ will only overheat the plant and potentially damage its\ntissue. As a result,\
    \ plants appear relatively dark in the PAR spectrum and relatively bright\nin\
    \ the near infrared spectrum. Clouds and snow, on the other hand, tend to be bright\
    \ in the\nred band (as well as other visible wavelengths) and dark in the near\
    \ infrared. Chlorophyll,\na pigment found in leaves, strongly absorbs visible\
    \ light for use in photosynthesis. In\ncontrast, the cellular structure of leaves\
    \ strongly reﬂects near-infrared light. The more\nleaves a plant has, the more\
    \ wavelengths are affected, and thus the greater the amount\nof light involved.\
    \ Because earth observation instruments collect data in the visible and\nnear-infrared\
    \ ranges, it was natural to use the large differences in reﬂectance of plants\
    \ to\ndetermine their spatial distribution in satellite images.\nThe following\
    \ formula is used to calculate the NDVI:\nNDVI = (NIR − Red)\n(NIR + Red)\n(1)\n\
    Red and NIR are abbreviations for spectral reﬂectance measurements obtained in\
    \ the\nvisible (red) and near-infrared regions, respectively.\n2.2. UAVs/Sensors\n\
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a type of robotic aircraft that are controlled\n\
    by radio and have their own built-in control systems. They were initially developed\
    \ in\nthe 1920s for use in the military as a replacement for human pilots serving\
    \ on hazardous\nmissions. In the past, the disadvantages of high cost, large sensors,\
    \ poor endurance,\nand primitive ﬂight control systems caused civilian UAV use\
    \ to develop slowly. At the\nbeginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, only a few\
    \ low-quality products were available for\nuse in scientiﬁc research. These disadvantages\
    \ still exist today. The market for low-cost\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\
    \ has expanded at a rapid rate thanks to the development of\nnew technologies\
    \ and the appearance of UAV manufacturers such as DJI (Shenzhen, China).\nThe\
    \ successful transition of UAVs from military to civilian uses has been facilitated\
    \ by\nthe development of several different technologies. There is now an abundance\
    \ of UAVs\navailable to meet the demand in various ﬁelds of use, including scientiﬁc\
    \ research.\nThe development of remote sensing technology has made it possible\
    \ to devise a\nworkable strategy for the collection of speciﬁc data used for mapping\
    \ land-cover changes,\nmonitoring drought conditions, and analysing complex characteristics\
    \ across space and\ntime. This technology uses a variety of sensors onboard satellites,\
    \ airborne or unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs), and it offers a variety of classiﬁcation\
    \ methods for vegetation at both\nlarge and small scales. A practical approach\
    \ to designing strategies for the management\nof forest disasters can be found\
    \ by employing the techniques of remote sensing. This can\ninclude evaluating\
    \ landslide-prone areas through airborne, UAV, and ground-based remote\nsensing,\
    \ as well as evaluating changes in vegetation cover after a wildﬁre for post-ﬁre\n\
    management by using satellite-based remote sensing and UAV.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 7910\n6 of 23\nThere is technology available today that can automatically steer\
    \ agricultural vehicles\nsuch as tractors [45–47] and harvesters along predeﬁned\
    \ paths using precise global navi-\ngation satellite systems (GNSS). Examples\
    \ of these types of vehicles include tractors and\ncombine harvesters. However,\
    \ a human operator is still required in order to monitor the\nsurrounding environment\
    \ and take corrective action if any potential hazards come into\nview in front\
    \ of the vehicle in order to guarantee its safe operation.\nIt is necessary for\
    \ there to be no need for a human operator whatsoever for the\nautonomous farming\
    \ vehicles to be able to operate in a manner that is both productive and\nrisk-free\
    \ without any assistance from a person. A safety system must be able to perform\n\
    accurate obstacle detection and avoidance in real time while maintaining a high\
    \ degree of\nreliability. Furthermore, in order to handle a wide variety of shifts\
    \ in the illumination and\nweather conditions, multiple sensing modalities need\
    \ to complement each other.\nFor a technological development of this magnitude,\
    \ extensive research and experi-\nments are required to investigate various sensor,\
    \ detection algorithm, and fusion\nstrategy combinations.\nToday platforms such\
    \ as drones support the integration of a wide variety of sensors\nemployed for\
    \ agriculture 4.0. However, the utilisation of these sensors in agriculture 4.0\
    \ is\nclosely linked to their capacity to detect the signal over a greater spectral\
    \ range. Fundamen-\ntally, in agricultural sensing technology four parameters\
    \ must be analysed: the spectral,\nspatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions.\
    \ However, in most cases the sensors provide\ninformation based on their spectral\
    \ resolution (multispectral, super-spectral and hyperspec-\ntral). Multispectral\
    \ sensors typically use from 3 to 10 bands to cover the relevant spectrum.\nEarly\
    \ detection of the disease, improved irrigation, water management, faster and\
    \ more\naccurate plant counts to optimize fertilizer application and pest control\
    \ represent some\nadvantages of this sensor. Super-spectral sensors use from 10\
    \ to 20 bands to cover broad\nportions of the spectrum. Hyperspectral sensors\
    \ compared to multispectral sensors cover\nhundreds or thousands of narrower bands\
    \ (10 to 20 nm), providing greater resolution and a\nhighly detailed electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum of agricultural ﬁelds. In addition, higher spatial\nresolution, ability\
    \ to distinguish smaller elements, higher temporal resolution, higher ra-\ndiometric\
    \ sensitivity and the ability to detect small differences in radiated energy represent\n\
    only some of the advantages.\n2.3. Self-Driving Tractors/GIS/Other Sensors\nTractors\
    \ used in agriculture are typically capable of working in any terrain. Moreover,\n\
    the signals coming from the navigation sensors are subject to a great deal of\
    \ unpredictability\nin terms of disturbances and noise sources. As a consequence\
    \ of this, it is essential for the\nsensor fusion module to contain efﬁcient methods\
    \ for signal conditioning and estimating\nthe state of the system.\nWhen it comes\
    \ to automated tractor guidance in the ﬁeld, an accurate position mea-\nsurement\
    \ is absolutely necessary. Because the GPS antenna was mounted on the roof of\
    \ the\ntractor cab, which was approximately three meters above the ground, any\
    \ inclination of\nthe tractor would result in an inaccurate position reading (roll\
    \ and pitch). An architecture\nthat uses edge devices to carry out a substantial\
    \ amount of computation (edge computing),\nstorage, and communication locally\
    \ and routes it over the Internet backbone is called fog\ncomputing or fog networking,\
    \ also known as fogging. A FOG was used to measure heading\nangle on this research\
    \ platform. Utilizing Euclidean angles, a method of correction that\ncompensates\
    \ for positional errors caused by inclination-related factors was developed.\n\
    Hardware design and software design are the two components that make up the\n\
    entirety of the overall structural design of unmanned agricultural machinery.\
    \ The de-\nsign of the hardware encompasses both the mechanical design and the\
    \ circuit design.\nProgramming for the control system execution process and algorithmic\
    \ formulations for\npath tracking control are components of software design. By\
    \ contrasting the traditional\nProportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control,\
    \ fuzzy control, and fuzzy PID control, this\narticle concludes that the fuzzy\
    \ PID control algorithm should be used to control the steering\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 7910\n7 of 23\nof agricultural machinery, while the traditional incremental\
    \ PID control algorithm should\nbe used to control the speed of the vehicle body\
    \ while it is in motion [48,49].\nThe quantity of sensors used to collect data\
    \ in various settings, as well as the quality\nof the data collected by those\
    \ sensors, has been steadily increasing. Even complex environ-\nments, such as\
    \ agricultural areas, can now be “sensed” via a wide variety of equipment,\nwhich\
    \ generates vast amounts of data that can be explored to provide helpful information\n\
    about the area that is being observed. Examples of such environments include urban\
    \ and\nwilderness areas. Because of this, an increased number of studies have\
    \ been carried out in\nan effort to research the vast amounts of information that\
    \ are hidden within the sensed data.\nHowever, it can be extremely difﬁcult to\
    \ transfer the advances made in experiments to the\nreal-world conditions that\
    \ are encountered in practice. There are two primary explanations\nfor this phenomenon.\
    \ To begin, the scope of the research projects that are described in\nscientiﬁc\
    \ texts is typically restricted. This is due to the fact that the data that are\
    \ utilized\nin these experiments typically do not cover all of the variables that\
    \ are connected to the\nissue at hand. As a consequence of this, the results that\
    \ are reported in those articles,\ndespite the fact that they might appear to\
    \ be encouraging, typically reveal nothing about\nthe performance of the proposed\
    \ technique under real-world conditions that are unre-\nstricted. Second, even\
    \ if the data adequately cover the variable conditions that are found\nin practice,\
    \ the chosen sensing technology may not be able to acquire enough information\n\
    to unambiguously resolve the data and provide enough information. This is a possibility\n\
    even if the data adequately cover the variable conditions that are found in practice.\
    \ For\ninstance, even powerful artiﬁcial intelligence models that are fed with\
    \ RGB digital images\nfrequently fail to correctly identify plant diseases based\
    \ on their symptoms. This is due to\nthe fact that different disorders can produce\
    \ visual signs that are similar to one another.\nThere are many sensors that can\
    \ be used in Agriculture 4.0, for example, the Soil\nMoisture Sensor used in our\
    \ case study, but also other environmental sensors, capable of\nproviding data\
    \ that can be used for cultivation decisions, also collected in time series that\n\
    can therefore provide trends. Meteorological data [50] can also provide useful\
    \ time series\nin agriculture.\nAs is well known, G.I.S. (Geographical Information\
    \ System)/WebGIS is a tool for\nanalysing, reporting and querying entities or\
    \ events occurring in the territory. Particularly\nin Agriculture 4.0, the use\
    \ of GIS allows researchers to integrate and manage data of\ndifferent natures\
    \ and, if properly implemented (open source), it also allows identiﬁcation\nof\
    \ optimal routes for vehicles and areas of greater interest in different areas\
    \ if integrated\nwith historical data.\nThe GIS makes use of images captured by\
    \ UAVs as well as Very High-Resolution\n(VHR) satellite imagery categorized using\
    \ OBIA. The Geographic Information System\n(GIS) is helpful for agriculture in\
    \ general, and not just for the management of vineyards\nspeciﬁcally. It takes\
    \ into account the geomorphology of the land, as well as the climatic\nconditions\
    \ (wind, rain, etc.), and the moisture conditions of the soil for the crops. This\n\
    system is able to provide alerts in the event that interventions are required\
    \ depending on\nthe water stress experienced by the crop. As a result, we are\
    \ able to highlight the optimal\nroute for the tractor.\n2.4. Data Fusion\nUtilizing\
    \ data fusion techniques is one approach to minimizing the gaps in coverage\n\
    that are the result of insufﬁcient data. The process of combining data from several\
    \ different\nsources in order to produce information that is more precise, consistent,\
    \ and concise than\nthat which is provided by any individual data source is referred\
    \ to as “data fusion.” There\nare also other deﬁnitions that are more stringent,\
    \ which better ﬁt speciﬁc contexts. Since\nthe ﬁrst half of the 1990s, people\
    \ have been applying this method to solve agricultural\nproblems, and recently,\
    \ there has been an increase in the number of cases in which this\nmethod is used.\
    \ Finding the most effective method to completely explore the synergy\nand complementarities\
    \ that may exist between various kinds of data and sources of data\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 7910\n8 of 23\nis arguably the most difﬁcult part of using techniques that\
    \ involve the fusion of data.\nThis is one of the main challenges that is involved\
    \ in the use of data fusion techniques.\nThis is especially the case when the\
    \ data being compared have signiﬁcantly different\ncharacteristics (for example,\
    \ digital images and meteorological data). Given the wide\nvariety of data sources\
    \ and methods utilized in agricultural applications [40,41], it can be\nchallenging\
    \ to ﬁnd a formalization for the data fusion process that is suitable for all\
    \ of these\napplications. A perspective on the data fusion process is given here,\
    \ broken down into\nthree stages and applicable to the vast majority of situations.\
    \ In the ﬁrst, the corresponding\nattributes used for describing information in\
    \ the various sources must be identiﬁed. This\nmust be done before moving on to\
    \ the next step. If the data sources are comparable, then\nﬁnding such a correspondence\
    \ is not difﬁcult; however, if different types of data are used,\nthen ﬁnding\
    \ such a correspondence may be more difﬁcult. This is one of the primary\nreasons\
    \ that led to the development of the three distinct types of data fusion that\
    \ are\ndiscussed in the paragraph that follows this one. In the second step, all\
    \ of the distinct\nobjects that are mentioned in the various data sources have\
    \ to be located and arranged in\nthe correct order. Because misalignments can\
    \ lead to inconsistent representations and, as\na result, unreliable answers,\
    \ this step is particularly important when the data sources are\nimages. Alignment\
    \ errors are a common cause of these problems. The third step, which\nis the application\
    \ of the actual data fusion, can be carried out once the data have been\ncorrectly\
    \ identiﬁed and are consistent. In actual practice, addressing the inconsistent\
    \ data\nthat already exist is frequently ignored. Auxiliary tools, such as data\
    \ proﬁle techniques,\nwhich can reduce inconsistencies by extracting and exploring\
    \ the metadata associated to\nthe data being fused, have the potential to (at\
    \ least partially) rectify this situation and bring\nit closer to an acceptable\
    \ state.\nWe essentially perform data fusion on satellite images and drone images\
    \ and then on\nvarious types of sensors using two different methodologies.\nGeomatics\
    \ uses various types of data (remote sensing from satellites, UAVs, and\nother\
    \ data), so data fusion techniques are natural depending on the various applications\n\
    to be carried out. This work aims to present on a study area the integration of\
    \ remote\nsensing techniques, UAVs, autonomous driving machines, data fusion,\
    \ and GIS in order\nto optimize the vineyard by optimizing cultivation and production\
    \ by managing data\nof various types acquired with different methodologies. Geomatics-type\
    \ methodologies\nused in other works and integrated here are speciﬁcally applied\
    \ in this note for use and\noptimisation to contribute to agriculture 4.0.\n3.\
    \ Case Study\nIn the course of our research on a broader study area, focusing\
    \ in particular on a\nvineyard that was located in Bova Superiore, a small municipality\
    \ in the province of\nReggio Calabria (South Italy), neighbourhood Briga, and\

    \ in terms of the distance limits that can exist between antennas and the signal\n\
    quality that can be achieved. In most cases, the maximum permissible distance\
    \ between\nantennas is one hundred meters when the weather is clear, there is\
    \ a direct line of sight\nbetween them, and there are no obstructions in the way.\
    \ The signal quality can be affected\nby a variety of parameters, including the\
    \ kind of antenna that is used and the possibility\nof interference.\nThe use\
    \ of the mobile phone network, on the other hand, has a number of beneﬁts,\nincluding\
    \ complete independence among stations and vehicles, increased reliability due\n\
    to the fact that it does not require compliance with minimum distances, and the\
    \ capacity\nto process remote data remotely. The disadvantages include signiﬁcantly\
    \ higher latencies\nand increased costs. This is due to the fact that every device\
    \ needs to be outﬁtted with a\nmobile network modulus and a SIM card that is associated\
    \ with a particular data plan or a\nphone contract.\nSensors 2022, 22, 7910\n\
    12 of 23\nAn open-source GIS/WebGIS was used for the processing and visualisation\
    \ of the\nvarious data acquired. The GIS/WebGIS displays the results of the processing\
    \ and the\noptimal routing of the routes, as well as highlighting the needs and\
    \ requirements of the\narea, such as the need for irrigation timing, fertilisation\
    \ timing, and anything else that may\nbe useful for Agriculture 4.0, with appropriate\
    \ alerts based on data fusion with other data.\nIn order to verify the effectiveness\
    \ of the development, a platform for transmission to\nthe GIS and user interface\
    \ is created; it runs a procedure called Data Transfer GIS (DTGIS)\nfor the subsequent\
    \ export of the data acquired within the GIS, where the “historical” update\n\
    is managed in the existing database.\nIn more detail, the DTGIS was designed to\
    \ automatically transfer data acquired in\nthree software modules, each with its\
    \ own set of functions, to the GIS:\nThe Plug-in Module, which increases the number\
    \ of recognizable and classiﬁable\nobjects that can be represented;\nThe kernel,\
    \ which interacts with users and coordinates the different modules, pre-\nprocessing\
    \ and post-processing the Input/Output data of the modules themselves;\nThe GIS\
    \ I/O (Input/Output) Module, which manages the interface with the GIS software.\n\
    In particular, the ﬁles (space database where the various attributes have been\
    \ assigned\nto the objects) are given in Input in the GIS I/O module, returning\
    \ Output polylines and\npolygons in shp-dbf format.\nTo implement the proposed\
    \ system, a variety of algorithms and methodologies were\nused. Speciﬁcally, a\
    \ multi-objective function based on Genetic Algorithms was used to\ndetermine\
    \ the tractor’s route.\nFurthermore, using Machine Learning algorithms, real-time\
    \ hourly and continuous\ncycle trend information was obtained based on a comparison\
    \ with recent and historical\ndata (including the Backpropagation algorithm for\
    \ the historical series).\nIFTTT (If This Then That) is a programming language\
    \ that allows for the real-time\ncreation of condition chains called applets that\
    \ are triggered by other services (e.g., Gmail,\nFacebook, Instagram, etc.) and\
    \ can send a message when the user, for example, uses a\nhashtag in a tweet, or\
    \ can send a copy of a Facebook photo to an archive when the user is\ntagged in\
    \ it. IFTTT can automate processes related to home automation or web applications,\n\
    such as receiving personalized weather forecasts or alerts in the event of an\
    \ emergency,\nsuch as a ﬂood. In our case, we used this service to send alerts\
    \ and to automate tractor’s\nroute when an alert is received.\nApplet programming\
    \ logic is of the following type: if a predetermined event occurs\n(trigger),\
    \ then perform a predetermined action.\n3.3. Other Types of Sensors\nA wide range\
    \ of available sensors can contribute signiﬁcantly to agricultural practices.\n\
    With the availability of low-cost data processing, solar panels, improved batteries\
    \ and\ncommunications technology, the trend is now for these to operate wirelessly\
    \ and transmit\ndata to the user rather than relying on manual data collection.\
    \ A variety of sensors are\navailable for this purpose, including soil temperature,\
    \ soil moisture content, air temperature\nand relative humidity, rainfall, solar\
    \ radiation, barometric pressure, leaf wetness and wind\nspeed and direction.\n\
    3.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensor\nAs mentioned above, the ability to integrate several\
    \ sensors is of crucial importance.\nFor example, the Soil Moisture Sensor is\
    \ used to measure volumetric moisture content of\nsoils and other material for\
    \ scientiﬁc research and agricultural applications. The sensor\nmeasures volumetric\
    \ water content via the dielectric constant of the soil using capacitance\ntechnology.\
    \ It uses a 70 MHz frequency, which minimizes salinity and textural effects,\n\
    making it an ideal sensor in agricultural and standard scientiﬁc projects. Speciﬁcations\
    \ on\ncharacteristics of the Soil Moisture Sensor are given in Table 3.\nSensors\

    \ techniques and are used in other applications,\nbut the leaf wetness sensor\
    \ is aimed speciﬁcally at agricultural use and comprises a surface\nof conductive\
    \ combs with a resistance of 2 MΩ when dry. This falls when condensation\noccurs\
    \ on the surface, reaching approximately 5 kΩ when completely wet. The sensor\n\
    generates a voltage that is inversely proportional to the degree of condensation.\n\
    3.3.3. PH Sensor\nThe PH (Potential Hydrogen) meter is a device used to measure\
    \ acidity and alkalinity\nlevels in water, soil and photo chemicals. The PH meter\
    \ consists of a voltmeter attached to\na pH-responsive electrode varying in the\
    \ range of 0 to 14.\nThe solutions with a pH value between 0 and 7 are acidic\
    \ solutions with a large\nconcentration of hydrogen ions, whereas solutions with\
    \ a pH value between 8 and 14 have\nbasic solutions with small concentrations\
    \ of hydrogen. Solutions with a pH value of 7 are\nneutral solutions. In this\
    \ process, we can detect the pH levels in the soil, in Table 4.\n3.3.4. Temperature\
    \ and Humidity Sensor\nThe sensor has a humidity measuring module, a thermistor\
    \ and an integrated circuit on\nthe back of the sensor unit. The humidity measurement\
    \ module consists of two electrodes.\nSandwiched between the two electrodes is\
    \ a substrate that is capable of holding moisture.\nChange in humidity alters\
    \ the conductivity of the moisture-holding substrate, which at the\nsame time\
    \ changes the resistance. The integrated circuit then processes the change in\
    \ the\nresistance and the humidity value is measured. On the other hand, a change\
    \ in temperature\nchanges the resistance of the thermistor, which is processed\
    \ by the integrated circuit and\nthe calibration results in a temperature value.\n\

    \ Sensor\nBarometric pressure sensors measure the absolute pressure of the air\
    \ around them.\nThis pressure varies with both the weather and altitude. Depending\
    \ on how you interpret\nthe data, you can monitor changes in the weather, measure\
    \ altitude, or any other tasks that\nrequire an accurate pressure reading. The\
    \ sensor consists of a piezoelectric transducer based\non the characteristic of\
    \ silicon to generate an electrical potential difference proportional to\nthe\
    \ mechanical stress applied on its surface. This type of transducer is characterized\
    \ by\nextremely accurate performance and stable measurements of atmospheric pressure,\
    \ with\nexcellent repeatability and low hysteresis. An electronic ampliﬁer circuit\
    \ normalizes the\noutput signal in the most common formats used by acquisition\
    \ circuits (0–1 V, 4–20 mA).\nAn electrical circuit for compensating the temperature\
    \ allows more accurate measurements.\n3.4. Data Fusion\nAs mentioned in Section\
    \ 2.4, we use two different methodologies to perform data\nfusion on satellite\
    \ and drone images, as well as data fusion on various types of sensors.\nSensors\
    \ are used in agriculture for everything from weather monitoring to self-\nwatering.\
    \ Designers can create a prototype for a hardware environment to implement\nthe\
    \ data acquisition and mining process by using low-cost sensors. Thus, the relationship\n\
    between sensors can be understood, and a sensor fusion test environment can be\
    \ created.\nVarious input devices are synchronized using a microcontroller system,\
    \ and all data ob-\ntained from the sensors is wirelessly sent to the cloud by\
    \ an IoT (Internet of Things) device,\nby recording and monitoring from the graphical\
    \ user interface on the web as a real-time\nenvironment to apply data mining algorithms\
    \ later. So, we obtain sensor data relations\nfrom various different data sources,\
    \ such as soil moisture, but it is also possible to obtain\ndata on light, temperature,\
    \ humidity, rain, atmospheric pressure, air quality, and dew point.\nIn the ﬁrst\
    \ experiment illustrated here, we use the soil moisture sensor. Each sensor data\n\
    reading has a different effect on agricultural monitoring; however, reducing the\
    \ number of\nsensors can reduce the cost of a system while still providing accurate\
    \ observations via the\nproposed sensor substitution. A hardware test prototype,\
    \ as well as a software design, are\ncreated for data monitoring and sensor fusion\
    \ in various combinations.\nAcquiring useful data from agricultural areas has\
    \ always been difﬁcult because they\nare often vast, remote, and vulnerable to\
    \ weather events. Despite these obstacles, as\ntechnology advances and prices\
    \ fall, a ﬂood of new data is being collected. Although\na wealth of data is being\
    \ collected at various scales (e.g., proximal, aerial, satellite, and\nancillary\
    \ data), this has been geographically unequal, leaving some areas virtually devoid\n\
    of useful data to help them face their speciﬁc challenges. However, even in areas\
    \ with\nabundant resources and well-developed infrastructure, data and knowledge\
    \ gaps persist,\nowing to the fact that agricultural environments are mostly uncontrolled\
    \ and there are\na plethora of factors that must be considered and properly measured\
    \ in order to fully\ncharacterize a given area. As a result, even with very effective\
    \ algorithms and a well-\ndeﬁned and limited-scope problem, data from a single\
    \ sensor type are frequently unable to\nprovide unambiguous answers. One possible\
    \ solution that has been researched for decades\nis fusing the information contained\
    \ in different sensors and data types. The concept behind\ndata fusion is to investigate\
    \ the complementarities and synergies of various types of data in\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 7910\n15 of 23\norder to extract more reliable and useful information about\
    \ the areas being studied. While\nsome success has been achieved, there are still\
    \ many obstacles that prevent this type of\napproach from becoming more widely\
    \ adopted. This is especially true in agricultural areas,\nwhich have highly complex\
    \ environments.\nAmong the various data fusion methods, kriging was used, the\
    \ weights of which were\nthought of as space variants and determined from calculations\
    \ applied to plant growth\nphenomenology. In other words, rainfall and weather\
    \ values in general, NDVI at varying\nseasons, and soil type were sampled at certain\
    \ target points, from which a certain value of\nsoil moisture was estimated. From\
    \ these values, kriging was carried out at the location of\nthe moisture sensor\
    \ and compared with this truth value. The typical abatement parameters\nof the\
    \ method are varied until a conﬁguration of minima is found for which the value\n\
    calculated by kriging and the value measured by the sensor are small. At this\
    \ point, these\nabatement parameters can be used for kriging applicators to neighbouring\
    \ areas, either\nfrom points observed by humidity sensors or derived from other\
    \ devices.\nSo far, we have talked about data fusion between different sensors,\
    \ but data fusion\nbetween images and sensors is also possible, as is the use\
    \ of neural networks to improve\nimage resolution.\nThe technology associated\
    \ with the use of drones has undergone strong development\nin the last decade\
    \ by improving the stability of the craft, lightening the structure, perfect-\n\
    ing the precision and accuracy of acquisition and optimising the software for\
    \ processing\ndata. Among other things, this technology ﬁnds application in environmental\
    \ monitoring,\ncombining data acquisition over a wide area with high resolution\
    \ and multispectral infor-\nmation. However, surveying with UAVs (Unmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicles) is not always cheaper\nthan using satellite data. This is where the\
    \ use of machine learning, and in particular,\nSuperResolution, comes in.\nThe\
    \ freely available satellite data, as far as the Sentinel missions of the Copernicus\n\
    programme are concerned, give a considerable advantage, but the resolution of\
    \ these data\nmay be too low for the studies to be carried out. It is therefore\
    \ necessary to intervene\nwith processing methods to improve the quality of the\
    \ data. Furthermore, the timing of\nacquisition favours the use of satellite data\
    \ over the drone survey and the processing of the\nrelated data because it is\
    \ time-consuming. The satellite data, on the other hand, supplied\nalready corrected\
    \ in terms of reﬂectance, are directly usable after downloading.\nWith the use\
    \ of a convolutional neural network, a procedure is applied that uses the\nsatellite\
    \ images as the basic data and allows a higher resolution product to be obtained.\
    \ To\nachieve this, the VDSR (Very Deep Super Resolution) neural network is iplemented,\
    \ using\nimages acquired by drone for training the network. The aim of this work\
    \ is to study the\napplicability of the VDSR (Very Deep Super Resolution) neural\
    \ network in the context of\nremote sensing, using drone images as data.\nSuper-resolution,\
    \ a process for obtaining high-resolution images from low-resolution\nimages,\
    \ compensates in Remote Sensing for limitations due to a spatial resolution that\
    \ is\nnot always adequately detailed. Single Image Super-Resolution (SIRS), in\
    \ particular, aims\nto construct a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution\
    \ image. A basic approach\nto achieve the improvement of an image’s resolution\
    \ is interpolation, but there are other,\nmore elaborate strategies that have\
    \ the same goal.\nThe deep learning algorithm VDSR (Very-Deep Super-Resolution)\
    \ is one of the possible\ntechniques that can be used to perform the SISR process.\
    \ Initially, the training of the\nneural network is necessary in order to then\
    \ use the VDSR network to obtain a high-\nresolution image from a single low-resolution\
    \ image. VDSR is a convolutional neural\nnetwork CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)\
    \ with the aim of relating high- and low-\nresolution images that differ mainly\
    \ in high-frequency detail. The procedure is based on\ndetermining the residuals\
    \ between the two images, i.e., a high-resolution reference image\nand a low-resolution\
    \ image scaled to the same size as the reference image by means of\nbicubic interpolation.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 7910\n16 of 23\nThe objective of the multispectral analysis\
    \ was the calculation of the NDVI index,\nwhich can be obtained from the Red and\
    \ NIR band.\nThe tests carried out on areas of different extension highlight the\
    \ different possibility of\nusing the image processed with the VDSR network as\
    \ the survey area varies. For a portion\nof territory of the order of magnitude\
    \ of one hundred metres, the data acquired with a\ndrone possess resolution and\
    \ detail that the other images cannot represent. For an area of\napproximately\
    \ 25 hectares, the improvement obtained by processing with the VDSR neural\nnetwork\
    \ is enhanced; the extension is high enough to evaluate the use of the drone carefully,\n\
    but not so large as to accept the detail of the satellite image. Here, the use\
    \ of the neural\nnetwork emphasises the edges of the framed elements more strongly,\
    \ making them more\neasily recognisable. For an analysis area of the order of\
    \ magnitude of several kilometres\nsideways or larger, processing with a VDSR\
    \ neural network offers an improvement, but\nthe detail required by the study\
    \ can also be satisﬁed by using the original satellite image.\nA crucial aspect\
    \ in the application of deep learning, which must be carefully evaluated in\n\
    combination with the desired image enhancement, is the computing power required\
    \ to\nperform the processing. The processing time for both the training of the\
    \ neural network\nand its activation is non-negligible if adequate equipment is\
    \ not available. To give an\nexample, the training of the VDSR network used for\
    \ the analyses in this study would have\ntaken about ten days on an average commercial\
    \ laptop with an Intel Core i5 5th Generation\nprocessor and 8-Gigabyte RAM. Furthermore,\
    \ obtaining an image with a larger pixel size\nthan the satellite image also increases\
    \ the calculation time for subsequent processing, such\nas classiﬁcation. The\
    \ time factor negatively affects the evaluation of the practical use of the\n\
    neural network, particularly when compared to other methods of improving the resolution\n\
    of an image, such as interpolation.\n4. Results\nAfter selecting from the Sentinel\
    \ and WorldView images and UAVs multispectral im-\nages, and other sensor (Soil\
    \ Moisture Sensor) data, a data fusion procedure was performed\nwith particular\
    \ reference to areas A and B (Figure 4). So, a procedure has been put into place\n\
    so that the value of the NDVI can be automatically determined from satellite images.\
    \ In\norder to achieve homogenization of Sentinel and UAV data, it is necessary\
    \ to automatically\ndetermine the value of NDVI derived from satellites (NDVIsat),\
    \ through a downsampling\nof correlation between pixels s(i,j) from satellite\
    \ and P(i,j) from UAV), to calculate the NDVI\nfrom UAV (NDVIuav) and to calculate\
    \ both the NDVI for the leaf canopies of the vines\n(NDVIvin) and NDVI of inter-row\
    \ area (NDVIint). In fact, an important tool for evaluating\nthe variability in\
    \ the vineyard and therefore the vines’ vigour is the NDVI index, thus\ncalculated\
    \ for the pixels of the Sentinel and WorldView image s(i,j) thanks to the spectral\n\
    data) in RED and NIR bands:\nNDVIsat(i, j) = nN(i, j) − nR(i, j)\nnN(i, j) + nR(i,\
    \ j)\n(2)\nA preliminary downsampling method of the high-resolution UAV images\
    \ was used to\nallow the comparison of the UAV-based MSI and the satellite imaging.\
    \ So, we proceeded to\nsampling the UAVs, data (at higher resolution) for comparing\
    \ them with the corresponding\nsatellite data, i.e., the set of UAV data D corresponding\
    \ to P(i,j):\nG(i, j) = {d(u, v) ∈ D|αs(i, j + 1) ≤ αd(u, v) < αs(i, j), βs(i,\
    \ j) ≤ βd(u, v) < βs(i + 1, j), ∀u, v}\n(3)\nThus the satellite data s(i,j) and\
    \ UAV data P(i,j) show the same subset of the vineyard.\nThree NDVIs were analysed\
    \ from the VHR 2 data from the multispectral sensor mounted\non the UAV, then\

    \ \ngenerally, of the row crops. This is despite the fact that the resolution\
    \ of the drone data is \nnot comparable to that of the image. \nThe ground sampling\
    \ distance (GSD) for the panchromatic band on WorldView-3 is \n31 centimetres,\
    \ while the GSD for the eight multispectral bands is 124 centimetres. Pro-\nceeding\
    \ in the same manner as here with the UAV and using imagery obtained from the\
    \ \nWorldView-3 satellite would result in an analysis of the vigour that is significantly\
    \ more \naccurate. We could also provide a verification with Object-Based Image\
    \ Analysis (OBIA), \nfirst using segmentation of the canopies and inter-row areas,\

    \ of Things (IoT) technologies have increased\npossibilities of realizing smart\
    \ cities where collaborations and integrations of various IoT application\nsystems\
    \ are essential. However, IoT application systems have often been designed and\
    \ deployed\nindependently without considering the standards of devices, logics,\
    \ and data communications.\nIn this paper, we present the design and implementation\
    \ of the IoT server platform called Smart\nEnvironmental Monitoring and Analytical\
    \ in Real-Time (SEMAR) for integrating IoT application systems\nusing standards.\
    \ SEMAR offers Big Data environments with built-in functions for data aggregations,\n\
    synchronizations, and classiﬁcations with machine learning. Moreover, plug-in\
    \ functions can be easily\nimplemented. Data from devices for different sensors\
    \ can be accepted directly and through network\nconnections, which will be used\
    \ in real-time for user interfaces, text ﬁles, and access to other systems\nthrough\
    \ Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API)\
    \ services. For\nevaluations of SEMAR, we implemented the platform and integrated\
    \ ﬁve IoT application systems,\nnamely, the air-conditioning guidance system,\
    \ the ﬁngerprint-based indoor localization system, the water\nquality monitoring\
    \ system, the environment monitoring system, and the air quality monitoring system.\n\
    When compared with existing research on IoT platforms, the proposed SEMAR IoT\
    \ application server\nplatform offers higher ﬂexibility and interoperability with\
    \ the functions for IoT device managements,\ndata communications, decision making,\
    \ synchronizations, and ﬁlters that can be easily integrated\nwith external programs\
    \ or IoT applications without changing the codes. The results conﬁrm the\neffectiveness\
    \ and efﬁciency of the proposal.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; server platform;\
    \ SEMAR; IoT application system; sensor; MQTT;\nREST API\n1. Introduction\nThe\
    \ rapid growth of urban populations has increased the risk toward quality of life\n\
    (QoL) around the world [1]. Smart cities have been studied for identifying, preventing,\
    \ and\nacting in certain situations. In smart cities, QoL is commonly handled\
    \ with indicators that\nmeasure the effectiveness of the services and sustainability\
    \ of a city in domains/verticals,\nsuch as environments, health cares, securities,\
    \ transportation, economies, educations, and\ngovernments [2]. Particularly, the\
    \ environment vertical has drawn special attention in\nrecent years. Indicators\
    \ of environmental pollutants, such as air and water quality, road\nconditions,\
    \ and house conditions, must be monitored to detect adverse situations associated\n\
    with overpopulated regions. In this sense, Internet of Things (IoT) applications\
    \ must provide\ninteroperability tools that collect, store, and disseminate data\
    \ from several sensors, and\nprovide them to other systems [3,4]. Thus, smart\
    \ cities require collaboration and integration\nof various IoT application systems.\
    \ Studies of IoT server platforms have emerged for\nsuch purposes, where several\
    \ challenges hinder better management and analysis of IoT\napplication data using\
    \ platforms.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22176436\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 6436\n2 of 28\nThe ﬁrst challenge involves the lack of a common\
    \ data format between data sensors\nand data communication protocols. For instance,\
    \ to measure the air and water quality,\ndifferent sensors with different geo-location\
    \ concepts such as addresses, buildings, re-\ngions, or cities can be handled\
    \ in different ways. Thus, an IoT server platform should be\nable to handle various\
    \ data types from different sensors, which makes it necessary to be\nable to work\
    \ with each other despite the diversity in communication protocols or sensor\n\
    technologies.\nThe second challenge is the standard parameters for data processing.\
    \ As an example,\nthe majority of air quality monitoring systems use Air Pollution\
    \ Index (API) to deﬁne the\nindicators of the carbon monoxide (CO), the nitrogen\
    \ dioxide (NO2), the sulfur dioxide\n(SO2), the ozone (O3), and the particulate\
    \ matter (PM10) [5]. However, other researchers\nmentioned that it might be necessary\
    \ to consider other indicators such as the temperature\nand the humidity for their\
    \ measurements [6].\nThe third challenge concerns the data interoperability between\
    \ various IoT application\nsystems within the same domain. It can be described\
    \ as the integration of plural systems\nby sharing output data through information\
    \ networks [3]. For example, a smart building\nsystem should integrate the human\
    \ Indoor Positioning System (IPS) with the environment\nmonitoring system to improve\
    \ QoL while reducing energy usage.\nHowever, in general, IoT application systems\
    \ for smart cities have been designed\nwithout considering these challenges. They\
    \ have been deployed independently and cannot\nbe integrated with other systems.\n\
    In this paper, we propose an IoT server platform called Smart Environmental Monitoring\n\
    and Analytical in Real-Time (SEMAR) for integrating various IoT application systems.\
    \ SE-\nMAR is able to offer Big Data environments with rich built-in functions\
    \ for data aggregations,\nsynchronizations, and classiﬁcations with machine learning.\
    \ Moreover, plug-in functions can\nbe easily implemented and added there. Data\
    \ from devices for different sensors can be\naccepted directly and through network\
    \ connections, which will be used in real-time for\nuser interfaces, text ﬁles,\
    \ and access to other systems through Representational State Transfer\nApplication\
    \ Programming Interface (REST API) services.\nFor evaluations of SEMAR, we implemented\
    \ the platform and integrated ﬁve IoT\napplications, namely, the air-conditioning\
    \ guidance system, the ﬁngerprint-based indoor local-\nization system, the water\
    \ quality monitoring system, the environment monitoring system, and\nthe air quality\
    \ monitoring system. The results conﬁrm the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the\n\
    proposal, including the reduction in the data transmission delay with the implemented\n\
    Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) service [7].\nThe rest of this paper\
    \ is organized as follows: Section 2 presents related works.\nSection 3 presents\
    \ the design of SEMAR. Section 4 presents the implementation of SE-\nMAR. Sections\
    \ 5–9 brieﬂy describe the IoT application systems implemented in the SEMAR.\n\
    Section 10 describes comprehensive performance evaluations and comparative analysis\n\
    with similar related work. Section 11 presents the threats to validity. Finally,\
    \ Section 12\nconcludes this paper with future works.\n2. Related Works\nIn [8],\
    \ Kamienski et al. proposed a three-layered Open IoT ecosystem approach for\n\
    smart application architectures. It includes input, process, and output in IoT\
    \ application\nsystems. The input gathers information from multiple sources, such\
    \ as sensors and other\nservices. The standard communication protocols cover the\
    \ device connections. The process\nis given by a collection of methodologies,\
    \ procedures, and algorithms for effective and\nefﬁcient data processing. The\
    \ output provides capabilities for data visualizations and\naccessibility.\nIn\
    \ [9], Bansal et al. proposed ﬁve layers for the IoT application system architecture,\n\
    consisting of perception, transport, processing, middleware, and application.\
    \ They divided\ndata processing into two layers, where the processing layer concentrates\
    \ on ﬁltering and\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n3 of 28\nformatting the data, and the\
    \ middleware layer intends to execute various logical and\nanalytic operations.\n\
    The connectivity in IoT systems was discussed in [10], where Li et al. examined\
    \ the\nnetworking technologies, and described that IEEE 802.11 (WLAN), IEEE 802.15.1\
    \ (Bluetooth,\nLow-energy Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.6 (wireless body area networks),\
    \ and 3G/4G were the\nmost widely adopted in IoT application systems and smart\
    \ city environment systems.\nSince IoT systems might consist of various physical\
    \ things and sensors, it is essential\nto provide a device-to-device communication\
    \ protocol. Malche et al. in [11] proposed\nthe MQTT communication protocol for\
    \ environmental monitoring systems with multiple\ndevice sensors. Sharma et al.\
    \ in [12] deﬁned the Representational State Transfer (REST) web\nservice as the\
    \ gateway to collect device data through the HTTP POST protocol. Zhang et al.\n\
    in [13] studied NATS open source messaging to communicate between IoT devices\
    \ [14].\nThe numerous options of communication protocols were surveyed by Dizdarevic\
    \ et al.\nin [15]. They concluded that MQTT and HTTP POST are the most suitable\
    \ for IoT applica-\ntion systems since they are well matured and stable.\nIn [16],\
    \ Marques et al. proposed the IoT system architecture for the indoor air quality\n\
    (IAQ) system in a laboratory environment named iAQ Plus (iAQ+). It collects data\
    \ from\ndevices through Wi-Fi connections and stores data in the SQL server. The\
    \ authors proposed\na web portal and mobile application to manage and visualize\
    \ the obtained data; however,\nthe system does not offer data analysis functions\
    \ to process sensor data.\nIn [17], Benammar et al. proposed the IAQ system that\
    \ is integrated with the Emoncms\nIoT platform for storing and visualizing air\
    \ quality data, temperature, and humidity. The\nauthors used a Waspmote microcontroller\
    \ connected to Raspberry PI as sensor nodes and\nthe MQTT service to send data.\n\
    In [18], Mandava et al. proposed to integrate machine learning algorithms and\
    \ the\nIoT platform infrastructure for monitoring air pollution in smart cities.\
    \ The system collects\nenvironmental and location data to determine air pollution\
    \ conditions in speciﬁc areas, and\nuses the collected data to build a data model\
    \ for air pollution detections using supervised\nmachine learning algorithms.\
    \ The experiment results conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the\nproposed data model\
    \ for air pollution detections.\nIn [19], Senožetnik et al. proposed a management\
    \ framework for groundwater data in\nsmart cities. The system uses a web-based\
    \ IoT service to receive data through HTTP POST,\nconvert it into the JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON) format, and store it in the MongoDB\nNoSQL database.\
    \ It also allows sharing collected data through REST API. This system is\nsimilar\
    \ to our proposed one; however, the system only provided data communications\n\
    through HTTP POST. Moreover, it did not implement data processing functions to\
    \ analyze\nthe obtained data.\nIn [20], Kazmi et al. proposed a platform that\
    \ provides interoperability of diverse IoT\napplications in smart cities named\
    \ VITAL-OS. It can be integrated with other IoT application\nsystems through REST\
    \ API.\nIn [21], Toma et al. proposed an IoT platform for monitoring air pollution\
    \ in smart\ncities. The system contains wireless and wired connections with sensors\
    \ to send data\nthrough MQTT communications to the server using cellular networks.\
    \ It allows sharing\ndata through REST API; however, this platform was built and\
    \ implemented only for this\nIoT application of monitoring air pollution.\nIn\
    \ [22], Javed et al. proposed an IoT platform for smart buildings. It consists\
    \ of the\ndiscovery, storage, and service planes. The discovery plane performs\
    \ connectivity control\nwith devices through HTTP communications. The storage\
    \ plane manages data storage\nusing Apache Cassandra [23]. The service plane provides\
    \ data processing composed of data\nindexing, visualizing, and analysis.\nIn [24],\
    \ Badii et al. proposed an open source IoT framework architecture for smart cities\n\
    called Snap4City. The system offers modules for device managements, data processing,\n\
    data analysis, and data visualizations.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n4 of 28\nIn [25],\
    \ Putra et al. proposed an implementation of wireless sensor networks in smart\n\
    cities to monitor air pollution. A device will transmit data regarding the air\
    \ pollution to a\nserver through a Wi-Fi network.\nIn [26], Gautam et al. proposed\
    \ an IoT application for the water supply management\nsystem in smart cities.\
    \ The proposed architecture uses General Purpose Input Output (GPIO)\ncommunications\
    \ for connecting ultrasonic sensors and water pumps with Raspberry PI.\nMoreover,\
    \ it uses Ethernet cables as network interfaces to Raspberry PI and the router.\
    \ It\noffers data analysis services and real-time predictions using machine learning\
    \ algorithms\nfor processing data; however, this framework is only built for this\
    \ single IoT application.\nIn [27], Oliveira et al. proposed an IoT application\
    \ for road environment monitoring\nusing mobile-based sensors. The system receives\
    \ sensor data through HTTP POST commu-\nnications in the JSON format, and allows\
    \ processing and visualizing it. It also provides a\nfunction to export data in\
    \ CSV ﬁles.\nIn [28], Metia et al. proposed a digital ﬁlter for the IoT-based\
    \ air pollution monitoring\nsystem. The experiment results in this study show\
    \ that the data processing using Kalman\nﬁlter has enhanced the reliability and\
    \ accuracy of the system; however, they did not\nimplement the real-time data\
    \ processing.\nIn [29], Twahirwa et al. proposed the system for monitoring roads,\
    \ weathers, and\nenvironments by attaching multiple sensors to a vehicle and sending\
    \ sensor data to the\nIoT server. The IoT server can process, store, and visualize\
    \ data with the web application\nsystem.\nIn [30], D’Ortona et al. showed the\
    \ beneﬁts of implementing MQTT communications in\nIoT application systems for\
    \ smart cities. The MQTT communications allow the construction\nof highly scalable\
    \ and ﬂexible IoT systems.\nIn [31], Kumar et al. proposed an anomaly-based intrusion\
    \ detection system (IDS) to secure\nIoT networks from threats such as spying and\
    \ malicious controls. It was implemented at\nthe fog node level. The proposed\
    \ approach might be adopted as an additional system that\ncan avoid threats before\
    \ the IoT platform receives them. Moreover, in [32,33], a method was\nproposed\
    \ to protect IoT networks by data pre-processing functions. It comprises feature\n\
    mapping, missing value inputting, normalization, and feature selection techniques.\
    \ The\nproposed method is similar to our approach in the data aggregation function.\
    \ SEMAR only\nprocesses and stores sensor data registered in the sensor format\
    \ data storage.\nIn [34], Kumar et al. designed PEFL for secure open communication\
    \ channels in\nIoT application systems. The proposed method utilized Long Short-Term\
    \ Memory (LSTM)\nand privacy encoding techniques in order to reduce security risk\
    \ and maintain privacy.\nMoreover, in [35], authors proposed an framework for\
    \ preventing cyber attacks on IoT-fog\ncomputing. It offered virtualized northbound\
    \ interfaces such as load balancer and resource\nmanagement to manage networks\
    \ in IoT systems. The proposed architecture can be utilized\nto enhance network\
    \ performances for the SEMAR IoT application server platform in future\nworks.\n\
    3. Design of SEMAR IoT Server Platform\nIn this section, we present the design\
    \ of the SEMAR IoT server platform for integrating\nvarious IoT application systems.\n\
    3.1. System Overview\nFigure 1 shows the proposed design of the SEMAR IoT server\
    \ platform. The main\ncomponents are data input, data process, and data output.\
    \ The data input is responsible\nfor accepting data from various sources. It consists\
    \ of network interface devices and\ncommunication protocols. The data process\
    \ provides the modules for data processing,\ncontrol, and collection. The data\
    \ output enables visualizations and sharing of collected\ndata. In Table 1 we\
    \ summarize the nomenclature of all the symbols and variables used in\nthis paper.\n\

    \ to collect data from a number of different devices using various network\nconnectivity\
    \ and communication methods; therefore, the following network interfaces\nfor\
    \ constructing physical network connections are implemented in the platform, where\n\
    standard IoT communication protocols for data transmission, namely HTTP and MQTT,\n\
    are included. In the context of IoT, physical devices as a perception layer consist\
    \ of a\nnumber of sensors connected to a controller. With the growth of IoT technology,\
    \ controllers\nsuch as Arduino and Raspberry PI have provided diverse network\
    \ connectivity to accept\ndata from various sensors. General Purpose Input Output\
    \ (GPIO) is the programmable\ninterface in the device controller to receive or\
    \ send command signals from/to IoT sensor\ndevices [36]. In IoT application systems,\
    \ GPIO is the standard interface for connecting\nsensor devices with the controller.\
    \ In addition, it is used for connecting controllers with\nexternal modules such\
    \ as Wi-Fi ones for data communications. Universal Serial Bus (USB) is\nthe serial\
    \ communication media to link devices with computers via USB ports. Currently,\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 6436\n6 of 28\nnumerous sensor instruments and devices can transmit\
    \ data using USB connections. The\nUSB connection offers a high data transfer\
    \ capacity. In addition, external communication\nmodules such as Wi-Fi for data\
    \ communication can also be added using USB connection.\nRegarding the IoT data\
    \ transmission concept, diverse hardware and software con-\nnectivity should be\
    \ considered. Diverse network interfaces utilize hardware-based trans-\nmissions,\
    \ such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Cellular—this enables machine-to-machine and\n\
    device-to-server communication.\nIEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) is the most\
    \ prevalent network interface in IoT systems.\nIt connects devices with each other\
    \ and to servers. Wi-Fi is useful to connect a lot of devices\nregardless of their\
    \ locations with computers, which improves IoT application developments.\nEthernet\
    \ offers secure and dependable wired connectivity. It is one of the most used\
    \ network\ninterfaces in IoT systems; however, the implementation can be difﬁcult\
    \ over long distances.\nAlthough Wi-Fi and Ethernet offer excellent network performance,\
    \ we should consider\ntheir security and coverage area. The alternative network\
    \ interface that can be utilized is\ncellular networks. Cellular is the network\
    \ interface allowing the mobility of devices with\nthe existing widespread availability\
    \ of cells to connect with the internet. Currently, 5G\ncellular connections offer\
    \ solutions with wider bandwidths than Wi-Fi or Ethernet. The IoT\nplatform can\
    \ use it through Wi-Fi interfaces with mobile routers.\nThe last part of Data\
    \ Input is the communication protocol between IoT devices and\nservers. An IoT\
    \ server should support publish–subscribe and push-and-pull messaging\nsystems\
    \ for sending and receiving data. Thus, our proposed system utilizes MQTT and\n\
    REST API for the communication protocol service.\nMQTT is one of the protocols\
    \ that have been designed for data communications in IoT\napplication systems.\n\
    It can work with minimal memory and the processing\npower [37]. The MQTT broker\
    \ works for receiving messages from clients, ﬁltering the\nmessages according\
    \ to a topic, and distributing the messages to subscribers [38]. The\nMQTT broker\
    \ is implemented in the IoT gateway function of the platform to provide data\n\
    communication services in SEMAR. The IoT gateway function offers communication\
    \ ser-\nvices to connect sensor devices to the server. Using this protocol, sensor\
    \ devices can\ntransmit messages containing sensor data in the JSON format with\
    \ MQTT topics. By\nsubscribing data at the same MQTT topic, the data aggregation\
    \ program in the platform\nobtains each sensor data. In addition, the study by\
    \ Al-Joboury in [39] shows that the load\nbalancer can increase the performance\
    \ and the capacity of MQTT data communications.\nThe IoT gateway function also\
    \ implemented the REST API for receiving sensor data\nthrough the HTTP POST communication\
    \ protocol. It can only receive data in the JSON for-\nmat. The REST API provides\
    \ URLs for sensor data transmission. The management function\nin the platform\
    \ creates the unique URL for each device. The HTTP POST communication\nprotocol\
    \ is compatible with standard network interfaces. Using REST API, sensor devices\n\
    can transmit data in the JSON format.\n3.3. Data Process\nThe data process in\
    \ the SEMAR server platform offers various functions. The large\namount of data\
    \ from data input will be processed to obtain meaningful information using\nsome\
    \ functions. The functions are implemented as independent modules to reduce system\n\
    crashes at system failures. They can be extended to microservices [40,41]. The\
    \ concept of\nmicroservices is the method of developing a large-scale system with\
    \ a set of small indepen-\ndent services. For their implementations, thread-based\
    \ programs are adopted to improve\ntheir performances for real-time data processing.\
    \ Each service will initiate a new thread to\nprocess the newly coming data.\n\
    3.3.1. Data Management (Storage, Aggregator, and Plug-in Functions)\nThe data\
    \ management system is the main function of the IoT platform. In the context\n\
    of IoT, systems must provide data storage, transaction management, query processing,\
    \ and\ndata access for application systems. Thus, the IoT platform must offer\
    \ services to process\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n7 of 28\nthe data ﬂow from input\
    \ to output. Moreover, towards developing diverse IoT applications,\ndevices involved\
    \ in IoT should be able to generate different kinds of data types according\n\
    to the application.\nIn order to provide various IoT application systems, SEMAR\
    \ should be a useful\nplatform for a variety of IoT application systems. Thus,\
    \ it needs to support massive\namounts of data in different formats. Moreover,\
    \ it needs to store all the necessary data by\noffering data storage for every\
    \ application. The management data storage is the database that\nstores the operating\
    \ parameters in the SEMAR server platform including the implemented\nIoT application\
    \ systems. The data include the information regarding connected devices,\ncommunications,\
    \ and parameters for the process modules running on the platform. On\nthis platform,\
    \ each device has its own unique sensor format. The management data storage\n\
    database keeps the sensor format as the template to help the development of an\
    \ IoT\napplication system on this platform.\nMeanwhile, the sensor data storage\
    \ is the database that stores all the sensor data in\nthe platform. In IoT application\
    \ systems, sensor devices may offer various data and it\nmay change it over time\
    \ with unstructured formats; therefore, the platform uses the big\ndata technology\
    \ to store unstructured JSON objects generates the unique data storage for\neach\
    \ device. This data storage utilized only accepts registered device data; therefore,\
    \ we\nimplement additional data stored in the form of Log ﬁles. Log Files are\
    \ used to keep the\nvalues of any deﬁned or undeﬁned data using the CSV format.\
    \ The deﬁned data represents\na sensor data that ﬁts the format registered in\
    \ the management data storage. The undeﬁned\ndata represents data whose format\
    \ is not registered.\nThe schema data storage is the database that can be used\
    \ to help the users of IoT\napplication systems by dynamically specify the names,\
    \ ﬁelds, and data types in accessing\nthis storage. It supports multiple data\
    \ types, including integer, ﬂoat, date, time, date-time,\nand string.\nFigure\
    \ 1 illustrates that this database is used to store data synchronization results.\n\
    Through REST API, other systems can access to the sensor data storage. As the\
    \ advantage\nof this database, it can be dynamically deﬁned and modiﬁed by the\
    \ user. It can assist\nintegration of various complex IoT application systems.\n\
    In an IoT system, the data lifecycle begins with the communication gateway re-\n\
    ceiving sensor data, continues with data aggregation and preprocessing, and concludes\n\
    with data storage. For this purpose, SEMAR provides a data aggregator function.\
    \ The\ndata aggregator is the module of collecting data from various data sources,\
    \ applying\nthe value-added processing, and repackaging the information in a consumable\
    \ format.\nAlgorithm 1 illustrates the data processing procedure in this module.\
    \ It forwards the result\nto the following data ﬁlter or stores it in the data\
    \ storage through the database access.\nThe data management system plays a role\
    \ in the sensor data storage process and\nprovides access to additional data processing\
    \ functions. Those services are not only for\nsystems integrated in the IoT platform\
    \ (built-in) but also for plug-in functions that may be\ndeployed as an extension.\
    \ Because an IoT application system may require unique data\nprocessing that has\
    \ not been implemented in the platform. Thus, the platform is designed\nand implemented\
    \ so that users can easily implement plug-in functions without modifying\nexisting\
    \ codes, to fulﬁll the demands of IoT application systems. The plug-in functions\
    \ can\nuse REST API to access the data in the platform.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n\

    end\nend\nSet MSensor[”time”] ← currenttimestamp\nreturn MSensor\nend\nend\n3.3.2.\
    \ Data Filter and Synchronization\nIn this research, we additionally explore the\
    \ data processing capabilities required\nby IoT applications that are not included\
    \ in the standard data management services. For\nexample, sensors of IoT devices\
    \ may generate measurement errors and noise during the\nmeasuring process. It\
    \ can impact the risk of data analysis problems. In addition, IoT\napplications\
    \ such as indoor localization systems require real-time sensor data from several\n\
    devices simultaneously; therefore, our platform deploys the data ﬁlter and synchronization\n\
    functionalities for processing sensor data.\nThe functions of ﬁltering sensor\
    \ data before being saved in a data storage are imple-\nmented. Digital ﬁlters\
    \ are adopted to reduce noise and inaccuracies in data. The following\nprocedure\
    \ is applied for ﬁltering data:\n•\nIt receives sensor data in a JSON format.\n\
    •\nIt selects the sensor ﬁeld’s value to be ﬁltered.\n•\nIt add the ﬁeld value\
    \ in the JSON object with the ﬁlter result.\n•\nIt stores the JSON object in the\
    \ database.\nThe data synchronization function can synchronize the data from different\
    \ devices\nby referring to the timestamp in the data store schema. The timestamp\
    \ was given when the\nplatform receives the data from the sensor device. Thus,\
    \ the platform requests the data\nfrom each sensor’s storage at a speciﬁed detection\
    \ time. For each sensor data, the ﬁeld for\nthe identiﬁer (Fi) to group sample\
    \ data in a speciﬁc value, the ﬁeld for the value (Fv) to be\nsynchronized, the\
    \ default value (de f ault), and the four functions to process the data are\n\
    prepared. The following functions are implemented to process the data:\n•\nAverage:\
    \ it returns the average value of the data collected during the detection time.\n\
    •\nCurrent: it returns the last value among the data collected during the detection\
    \ time.\n•\nMax: it returns the highest value among the data collected during\
    \ the detection time.\n•\nMin: it returns the lowest value among the data collected\
    \ during the detection time.\nAlgorithm 2 illustrates the data processing procedure\
    \ in this module.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n9 of 28\nAlgorithm 2 Data Synchronization\n\

    \ and Real-time Classiﬁcation\nOne of the exploitation scenarios for the massive\
    \ quantity of IoT data is its predictive\ncapability by utilizing machine learning\
    \ approaches. Several researchers approved the\neffectiveness of machine learning\
    \ implementation in IoT applications [42–44]. Moreover,\nKumar et al. in [45]\
    \ proposed the ensemble design combining machine learning algorithms\nto protect\
    \ networks on the Internet of Medical Things in real-time; therefore, we implement\n\
    machine learning and real-time classiﬁcation function in SEMAR.\nThe machine learning\
    \ algorithms are implemented to help data classiﬁcations. The\nSupport Vector\
    \ Machine [46,47] and Decision Tree [48–50] are implemented in this platform as\n\
    standard machine learning algorithms in IoT application systems.\nDecision Tree\
    \ employs tree decisions including event outcomes, resource costs, and\nutility\
    \ costs. It can create a data model for predicting outcomes by learning simple\
    \ decision\nrules according to the data features. The data model structure consists\
    \ of internal nodes\nrepresenting an attribute, branches representing a decision\
    \ rule, and leaf nodes indicating\nan outcome. Here, C4.5, CART (Classiﬁcation\
    \ and Regression Trees), and Naive Bayes Tree\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n10 of 28\n\
    are selected and incorporated into the platform as the most well-known machine\
    \ learning\nalgorithms [48]. CART is the binary recursive partitioning method\
    \ that can handle both\nnumerical and category data [48–50]. It can determine\
    \ the impurity degree of acceptable\ndata and build a binary tree in which each\
    \ internal node provides two classes for the\naccepted attribute. The tree is\
    \ formed by iteratively picking the attribute with the lowest\nGini index. The\
    \ Gini index for each node is calculated by the following equation [48]:\nGini(t)\
    \ = 1 −\nn\n∑\ni=1\nP(i|t)2\n(1)\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized as\
    \ the regression and classiﬁcation\ntechnique [51]. This approach has been used\
    \ for the big data classiﬁcation [47]. The\nSVM computes linear decision boundary\
    \ lines that can separate the data for the labeled\ngroups. The SVM decision boundary\
    \ line is calculated by the following equation:\nf (x) = ∑\n∀i\nyiαiK(xi, x)\n\
    (2)\nwhere yi represents the class label, αi represents the learned weight, K()\
    \ represents the\nkernel function, xi denotes the support vector, and x denotes\
    \ the labeled training sample\ndata. The kernel function is given by a collection\
    \ of mathematical operations used to\nprocess the input data and convert it into\
    \ the required format. The radial basis function (RBF)\nkernel is one of the common\
    \ kernel functions in SVM. The following equation illustrates\nthe formula of\
    \ the (RBF) kernel:\nK(xi, xj) = exp(−d(xi, xj)2\n2l2\n)\n(3)\nwhere l represents\
    \ the length scale of the kernel and d(xi, xj) denotes the Euclidean distance\n\
    between xi and xj.\nDecision Tree and SVM have several hyper parameters. For them,\
    \ the Randomized Search\nMethod is implemented in SEMAR to ﬁnd the optimal combination\
    \ of hyper parameters,\ndue to its superior performances with the low cost and\
    \ short computing time compared to\nother methods.\nFor reference, the Decision\
    \ Tree algorithm has the following hyper parameters:\n•\nMaximum depth (max_depth):\
    \ represents the maximum depth of the tree model result.\nIt is used to select\
    \ the optimal model to prevent over-ﬁtting.\n•\nMinimum samples split (min_samples_split):\
    \ represents the minimal amount of data\nrequired to separate an internal node.\
    \ If it is large, it can prevent over-ﬁtting; however,\nif it is very large, it\
    \ can cause under-ﬁtting.\n•\nMinimum samples leaf (min_samples_lea f): represents\
    \ the minimal amount of data\nrequired to be left at the leaf node. It is similar\
    \ to the minimum samples split parameter.\n•\nMinimum weighted fraction leaf (min_weight_fraction_lea\
    \ f): represents the total weight\nrequired at a leaf node.\nThe Support Vector\
    \ Machine algorithm has the following main hyper parameters:\n•\nKernel: represents\
    \ the function of transforming the training dataset into the higher\ndimension\
    \ space. The standard kernel consists of Radial Basis Function (RBF), linear,\n\
    polynomials, and sigmoid.\n•\nC: represents the penalty parameter that controls\
    \ the trade-off between the decision\nboundary and the misclassiﬁcation. C value\
    \ controls the margin of the decision\nboundary line to avoid misclassiﬁcations.\
    \ The large value can prevent the model\nfrom allowing any misclassiﬁcation. If\
    \ the dataset is linearly separable, it will work;\nhowever, if the dataset is\
    \ non-separable/nonlinear, it is better to use a small C value\nto avoid overﬁtting,\
    \ although it allows misclassiﬁcations to occur.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n11 of\
    \ 28\n•\nGamma: represents the coefﬁcient of the kernel used to decide the curvature\
    \ of the\ndecision boundary line. The value of Gamma determines the shape of the\
    \ decision\nboundary line according to the number of dataset points. The large\
    \ value causes the\ndecision boundary to be easily affected by fewer data points,\
    \ and the shape becomes\ncomplex. It can be helpful for nonlinear datasets; however,\
    \ if it is too large, it tends to\nbe over-ﬁtting. On the other hand, for the\
    \ linear dataset, the small values make the\ndecision boundary line more general\
    \ and useful.\nThe machine learning algorithms allow the user to use the data\
    \ stored in the data\nstorage as the sample data. This module can generate a data\
    \ model for the real-time data\nclassiﬁcation module.\nThe real-time data classiﬁcation\
    \ function is implemented to analyze a huge amount of\ndata from various sensor\
    \ devices by periodically running the following procedure:\n1.\nIt loads the data\
    \ classiﬁcation model made by the machine learning algorithm.\n2.\nIt receives\
    \ sensor data from the database.\n3.\nIt classiﬁes data into classes by running\
    \ the data model.\n4.\nIt stores results in the database.\nThe classiﬁcation model\
    \ can be created by each user separately. Moreover, the user\ncan start or stop\
    \ the real-time data classiﬁcation at the user interface.\n3.4. Data Output\n\
    Several output components, such as the monitor display, the user interface, the\
    \ data\nexport, REST API, and the notiﬁcation function, are considered to use\
    \ the data in the\nplatform. The monitor display is attached to the sensor node,\
    \ and accesses the user\ninterface in the platform through a network connection.\
    \ It can easily show sensor data for\neach device.\nThe user interface is provided\
    \ at the web browser to allow users to see the sensor\nand synchronized data by\
    \ tables, graphs, or maps. The platform allows users to access the\nsensor data\
    \ using the time of data receipt. It receives the sensor data in the JSON format\
    \ by\naccessing REST API. The column in the table is formed automatically based\
    \ on the sensor\nformat of each device. The platform can generate the graph for\
    \ each registered format\nsensor. Visualization maps will display the data in\
    \ digital maps based on the GPS data. The\ndata export feature is designed and\
    \ implemented to allow users to download data in Excel,\nJSON, text, or CSV format\
    \ at the speciﬁed time. Users can use this feature by accessing to\nthe user interfaces.\n\
    REST API is employed as a back-end system to access the sensor data. The sensor\
    \ data\nare retrieved from the database and is converted to the JSON format. It\
    \ will be sent to the\nuser interface and plug-in functions using HTTP POST communications.\
    \ The platform can\nexchange and integrate data with other IoT application systems\
    \ via REST API.\nThe notiﬁcation function allows the user to deﬁne the threshold\
    \ for each sensor data\nas the trigger of the message notiﬁcation. If the value\
    \ is over the threshold, the platform\nwill send a notiﬁcation. The platform offers\
    \ two different communication services. First, it\npublishes a message to a speciﬁc\
    \ topic using the MQTT communication protocol. Thus, the\nIoT application system\
    \ can subscribe to topic to receive the messages. Second, it delivers\nemail notiﬁcations\
    \ through the mail server service installed on the server platform. The\nuser\
    \ can dynamically deﬁne email recipients.\n3.5. Management Service\nThe management\
    \ service is used to manage all functions in the SEMAR platform. It\nincludes\
    \ the managements of users, devices, communications, schema data, synchroniza-\n\
    tion functions, analytics, data ﬁlters, and notiﬁcation functions. The management\
    \ of users\nallows us to add users, set permissions, and restrict access to the\
    \ devices.\nThe device management service provides the functions to register the\
    \ devices and the\nsensors of the IoT application system. It allows managing the\
    \ sensor format for each device\ndynamically. The platform can process, save,\
    \ and display the data registered in the sensor\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n12 of\
    \ 28\nformat. For convenience, the SEMAR platform provides a template to add the\
    \ device with\nthe same sensor format easily. The schema data management allows\
    \ to create the schema\ndatabase, deﬁne the ﬁeld format, and manage the data.\n\
    The management service provides the functions to add, update, and delete settings\n\
    for data synchronizations, data analytics, data ﬁltering, and notiﬁcations. It\
    \ allows the user\nto run and terminate the module service in the data process.\
    \ All the conﬁguration settings\nare saved as JSON objects.\n4. Implementation\

    HTTP-POST\nIn this implementation, the following two types of communication protocol\
    \ services\nare implemented for data input. Mosquitto [52] is installed for the\
    \ MQTT broker. It allows\nthe platform to receive messages through various MQTT\
    \ versions, and supports connections\nfrom Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Cellular network\
    \ interfaces. Then, REST API is implemented\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n13 of 28\n\
    based on Python programming and Tornado web server [53]. It allows the platform\
    \ to\nreceive messages through HTTP POST and supports connections from Wi-Fi,\
    \ Ethernet, and\nCellular network interfaces.\nThe data process is deployed and\
    \ implemented in the platform. They are developed in\nPython using a variety of\
    \ modules and dependencies. For IoT data management systems,\nwe used two different\
    \ databases service implemented in the platform according to the\ndesign in Section\
    \ 3. The Big Data repository MongoDB [54] is utilized for the data storage\nfor\
    \ managements, sensors, and schema. MongoDB saves data in the JSON format as the\n\
    ﬂexible approach—there is no need to deﬁne data structures, unlike SQL. In addition,\
    \ the\nlog ﬁle is implemented in the CSV format. It can be accessed using a ﬁle\
    \ controller library\nin Python.\nTwo different data aggregators are implemented.\
    \ The ﬁrst one enables message\nreceptions using the MQTT communication protocol.\
    \ It allows a different MQTT communi-\ncation settings for each sensor device.\
    \ The second one does it with REST API. Both data\naggregators access the data\
    \ storage via PyMongo.\nIn this study, the data ﬁlter and synchronization capabilities\
    \ are utilized to process\nsensor data. Scipy and KalmanFilter Python libraries\
    \ are used to apply the data ﬁlters. After\nﬁltering the data, PyMongo is used\
    \ to save it in the data storage. The data synchronization\nused PyMongo for sensor\
    \ data in the data storage. Pandas is used for grouping data sensors.\nThreading\
    \ library is used to enhance the performance of the platform. This function runs\n\
    periodically on the server based on the detection time. The user can stop and\
    \ start this\nservice at the administration page in the user interface. Figure\
    \ 2 illustrates the user interface\nof the data synchronization function for the\
    \ sensor data during 30 s.\nFigure 2. Interface of data synchronization function.\n\
    According to the design systems in Section 3, the data analysis systems consist\
    \ learn-\ning process and real-time analysis service. We implemented both services\
    \ in Python.\nScikit-learn [55] is used to facilitate the learning process. The\
    \ Sklearn library is utilized for\nreal-time analysis to make the classiﬁcation\
    \ model during the learning process.\nData output includes the data visualization\
    \ and the data sharing with other systems\nincluding the plug-in systems. The\
    \ CodeIgniter PHP Framework is adopted to create user\ninterfaces based on the\
    \ Model-View-Control (MVC) design paradigm [56]. A user interface\nwill offer\
    \ data visualizations using HighchartJS, DataTalbes, and OpenStreetMap. Here,\
    \ Apache\nand PHP are required. Figure 3 shows the table of sensor data. Figure\
    \ 4 show graphs of\nsensor data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n14 of 28\nFigure 3.\
    \ Table of sensor data.\nFigure 4. Graphs of sensor data.\nDataTables library\
    \ is used to allow the user to download sensor data in Excel, JSON,\ntext, and\
    \ CSV formats at the speciﬁed times. Figure 5 show the data export interface.\n\
    REST API is built with Python and Tornado. It allows other application systems\
    \ and plug-in\nfunctions to access to sensor data in JSON formats.\nFigure 5.\
    \ Data export interface.\nFinally, The management service is built in Python and\
    \ Tornado web server. It allows\nus to receive messages through HTTP POST, and\

    \ System\nAs the ﬁrst IoT application system, the air quality monitoring system\
    \ is integrated in the\nproposed platform. It can monitor the air quality in smart\
    \ cities.\n5.1. System Architecture\nFigure 6 shows the system overview. This\
    \ system uses a single-board computer (SBC)\nthat is connected to the GPS sensor\
    \ device and the air quality sensor device through Wi-Fi.\nThe air quality sensor\
    \ device covers the carbon monoxide sensor (MQ7), the particulate mat-\nter sensor\
    \ (Shinyei PPD42), the sulfur dioxide sensor (MQ135), the ozone sensor (MQ131),\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 6436\n15 of 28\nand the nitrogen dioxide sensor (MiCS 2714.\
    \ The sensor sends the voltage measurement\ndata to the Arduino UNO via GPIO.\
    \ Arduino UNO converts the data into the value of the\npollutant concentration\
    \ level and sends it to the SBC via the MQTT protocol. When the\nair sensor data\
    \ are received, the SBC adds the current time and the location information\n(latitude\
    \ and longitude) from the GPS sensor to the air sensor data, and sends it in the\n\
    JSON format every ﬁve seconds through the MQTT connection.\nFigure 6. System overview\
    \ of air quality monitoring system.\n5.2. Implementation in Platform\nFigure 7\
    \ shows the ﬂow of the functions in the SEMAR server platform for integrating\n\
    this IoT application system. Through the MQTT connection, the data aggregator\
    \ receives\nthe sensor data and stores it in the data storage. The real-time classiﬁcation\
    \ estimates the air\nquality index from the data between 0 and 4 that corresponds\
    \ to the air quality categories\nof good, moderate, poor, very poor, and hazardous.\
    \ The output data are shown at the user\ninterface.\nFigure 7. Function ﬂow for\
    \ air quality monitoring system in platform.\nTo evaluate the system integration,\
    \ we run the system to monitor actual air quality\nconditions. The sensor device\
    \ is mounted on the vehicle, and the single-board computer\nsystem is placed inside\
    \ the vehicle during the experiment. The device system sends air\nquality and\
    \ GPS data every ﬁve seconds. The evaluation results show that SEMAR has\nsuccessfully\
    \ received the sensor data, processed it, and classiﬁed the air quality index\
    \ based\non it. The results can be displayed on the user interface in real-time.\
    \ Table 3 shows the\nevaluation results of the classiﬁcation model used in this\
    \ experiment. We compare two\nalgorithms consisting of Support Vector Machine\
    \ (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT).\nTable 3. Evaluation of air quality monitoring\

    in [21].\nMoreover, we also conducted experiment for hyper parameters tuning.\

    \ IoT application system, the water quality monitoring system is integrated.\n\
    It can monitor the water quality in rivers ﬂowing in smart cities.\n6.1. System\
    \ Architecture\nFigure 9 shows the overview of the system architecture. This system\
    \ utilizes the sensor\ndevice equipped with water quality sensors for the hydrogen\
    \ potential (pH), the oxidation\nreduction potential (ORP), the dissolved oxygen\
    \ (DO), the electrical conductivity (EC),\nthe temperature, total dissolved solids\
    \ (TDS), the salinity (Sal), and the speciﬁc gravity\n(SG). The edge computing\
    \ device Raspberry Pi 3 collects the sensor data every ﬁve seconds\nand sends\
    \ it to a server. The system was tested at various points in the river in Surabaya,\n\
    Indonesia. The sensor node detects multiple parameters of water quality.\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 6436\n17 of 28\nFigure 9. The system overview of the water monitoring\
    \ system.\n6.2. Implementation in Platform\nFigure 10 shows the ﬂow of the functions\
    \ in the platform for integrating this IoT\napplication system. Through the MQTT\
    \ connection, the data aggregator receives sensor\ndata from the devices and stores\
    \ it in the data storage. The real-time classiﬁcation function\nestimates the\
    \ water quality index from the collected data with a number between 0 and\n3 corresponding\
    \ to lightly polluted, heavy polluted, and polluted. The output data are\nshown\
    \ in the user interface.\nFigure 10. Function ﬂow for water quality monitoring\
    \ system in platform.\nWe evaluated the efficacy of the integration of SEMAR with\
    \ the water quality monitoring\nsystem. The evaluation was conducted by operating\
    \ the system in a real-world environment\nto monitor the water quality of a river.\
    \ The device transmits the water sensor data to the\nSEMAR server every five seconds\
    \ through MQTT communications. The experiment results\nindicate that the server\
    \ received the sensor data, classified the water quality index based on the\n\
    obtained data, and displayed it on the user interface in real-time. In addition,\
    \ we compared\nthe SVM and DT machine learning algorithms. are presented in Table\
    \ 5 shows the evaluation\nresults of the classification model utilized in the\
    \ real-classification function.\nTable 5. Evaluation of water quality monitoring\

    \ the water quality is\nhigher than 90%. Thus, the superiority of SEMAR on the\
    \ integration with water quality\nmeasurement systems was conﬁrmed with abilities\
    \ to receive and classify data in real-time.\n7. Integration of Road Condition\
    \ Monitoring System\nAs the third IoT application system, the road condition monitoring\
    \ system is integrated.\nIt can monitor road surface conditions in smart cities.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 6436\n18 of 28\n7.1. System Architecture\nFigure 11 shows the\
    \ system architecture overview. This system is implemented as a\nmobile-based\
    \ sensor network attached to the vehicle. This concept is called Vehicle as a\n\
    Mobile Sensor Network (VaaMSN). This system consists of the edge computing device,\
    \ the\nportable wireless camera, and the sensor device. The camera records the\
    \ road conditions in\nfront of the vehicle and transmits the image frames through\
    \ Real-Time Streaming Protocol\n(RTSP). The sensor device collects GPS, accelerometer,\
    \ and gyroscopes data, and transmits\nthem to the edge computing device via MQTT\
    \ protocol.\nFigure 11. System overview of road condition monitoring system.\n\
    The edge computing device detects potholes from the camera images using the deep\n\
    learning approach, OpenCV [57], and Tensorﬂow [58]. When detecting a pothole,\
    \ image\ndata are recorded in the directory ﬁle. Figure 12 shows the detected\
    \ pothole example by\nthe system. The edge computing will send the location, the\
    \ accelerometer, the gyroscopes,\nand the pothole state to the server through\
    \ the MQTT connection.\nFigure 12. Detected pothole example.\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 6436\n19 of 28\n7.2. Implementation in Platform\nFigure 13 shows the ﬂow of\
    \ the functions in the platform for integrating this IoT\napplication system.\
    \ The data aggregator receives sensor data from the device through the\nMQTT connection,\
    \ and stores it in the data storage. The output data appear in the user\ninterface.\n\
    Figure 13. Function ﬂow for road condition detection system in platform.\nTo evaluate\
    \ the system integration, we run the road condition monitoring system\nto monitor\
    \ road surfaces in actual conditions. We place the sensor device in the vehicle\n\
    according to the layout shown in the system overview. They send JSON data consisting\n\
    of the GPS location, accelerometer, gyroscope, and pothole status to the server\
    \ through\nMQTT communications when the system detects a pothole, as shown in\
    \ Figure 12. The\nexperiment results show that the system can receive data from\
    \ the device, process it, and\ndisplay it on the map of the user interface in\
    \ real-time.\n8. Integration of Air-conditioning Guidance System\nAs the fourth\
    \ IoT application system, the air-conditioning guidance system (AC-Guide) is\n\
    integrated. It can offer the guidance for the optimal use of air-conditioning\
    \ (AC) in smart\ncities [59].\n8.1. System Architecture\nFigure 14 illustrates\
    \ the system architecture overview. AC-Guide uses a web camera,\na DHT22 sensor,\
    \ and Raspberry Pi 3 model b+ as the sensor device. The Python program\nof the\
    \ system periodically (1) collects the humidity and temperature of the room and\
    \ the\nAC control panel photo, (2) collects the standard outdoor weather data\
    \ by accessing to\nOpenWeatherMap API [60], (3) calculates the indoor discomfort\
    \ index (DI) to determines\nwhether the indoor state is comfort or discomfort,\
    \ (4) calculates the outdoor DI to determines\nwhether the outdoor state is comfort\
    \ or discomfort, (5) detects the on/off state of the AC from\nthe photo, (6) sends\
    \ the message to turn on or turn off the AC considering the indoor DI,\nthe outdoor\
    \ DI, and the on/off state of AC, (7) saves the data in the log ﬁle, and (8) send\n\
    the data to the server using the MQTT connection.\nFigure 14. System overview\
    \ of AC-Guide.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n20 of 28\n8.2. Implementation in Platform\n\
    Figure 15 shows the ﬂow of the functions in the platform for integrating this\
    \ IoT\napplication system.\nFigure 15. Function ﬂow for AC-Guide in platform.\n\
    We evaluated the effectiveness of the integration of SEMAR with the air-conditioning\n\
    guidance system. The experiment was carried out by running the system at the #2\
    \ Engineer-\ning Building in Okayama University. The device sends JSON data containing\
    \ the indoor\nhumidity, indoor temperature, indoor discomfort index (DI), outdoor\
    \ humidity, outdoor\ntemperature, outdoor discomfort index (DI), and state of\
    \ AC using MQTT communications\nevery one minute. The evaluation results show\
    \ that SEMAR can receive sensor data and\ndisplay sensor data in real-time on\
    \ the user interface. Previously, these data were not\naccessible from other systems.\
    \ By integrating SEMAR, they can access the data through\nREST API. In addition,\
    \ SEMAR allows adding new sensors to the system without changing\nthe codes; therefore,\
    \ the advantages of integrating the SEMAR system is conﬁrmed.\n9. Integration\
    \ of Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization System\nAs the last IoT application\
    \ system, the ﬁngerprint-based indoor localization system using\nIEEE802.15.4\
    \ protocol (FILS15.4) is integrated. It detects the user locations in indoor environ-\n\
    ments according to the ﬁngerprints of the target location. The process is divided\
    \ into the\ncalibration phase and the detection phase [61,62].\n9.1. System Architecture\n\
    Figure 16 illustrates the overview of FILS15.4 architecture. This system adopts\
    \ trans-\nmitting and receiving devices by Mono Wireless which employs the IEEE802.15.4\
    \ protocol\nat 2.4 GHz [63]. The transmitter Twelite 2525 is small with 2.5 ×\
    \ 2.5 cm and can be powered\nwith a coin battery for a long time. The receiver\
    \ Mono Stick is connected to Raspberry Pi over\na USB port. To improve the detection\
    \ accuracy, the sufﬁcient number of receivers should be\nlocated at proper locations\
    \ in the target area.\nFigure 16. System overview of FILS15.4.\nRaspberry Pi receives\
    \ data from a transmitter, determines the link quality indication\n(LQI) for each\
    \ transmitter, sends the LQI with the ID to the MQTT broker using the MQTT\nprotocol.\
    \ The server receives them from the MQTT broker, synchronizes the data from all\n\
    the receivers, calculates the average LQI with the same transmitter ID, and keeps\
    \ the results\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n21 of 28\nin one record in the SQLite database.\
    \ The previous implementation used a free public\nMQTT service.\n9.2. Calibration\
    \ Phase\nThe calibration phase generates and stores the ﬁngerprint dataset. Each\
    \ ﬁngerprint\nconsists of n LQI values where n represents the number of receivers.\
    \ It represents the\ntypical LQI values when a transmitter is located at the corresponding\
    \ location (room in\nFILS15.4).\n9.3. Detection Phase\nThe detection phase detects\
    \ the current room by calculating the Euclidean distance\nbetween the current\
    \ LQI data and the ﬁngerprint for each room and ﬁnding the ﬁngerprint\nwith the\
    \ smallest distance.\n9.4. Implementation in Platform\nFigure 17 shows the ﬂow\
    \ of the functions in the platform for integrating this IoT\napplication system.\
    \ The data synchronization function synchronizes the measured LQI\nvalues among\
    \ all the receivers using the transmitter’s ID, and saves it in the schema data\n\
    storage. The detection program is implemented as the plug-in function in the platform,\
    \ and\nreceives data through REST API services.\nFigure 17. Function ﬂow for FILS15.4\
    \ in platform.\nWe evaluate the integration of SEMAR with the ﬁngerprint-based\
    \ indoor localization\nsystem by running the system at two ﬂoors in the #2 Engineering\
    \ Building of Okayama\nUniversity. This system used six receivers to measure LQI\
    \ from each transmitter. The\nreceiver sent the LQI data every 500 ms to the server\
    \ through MQTT communications.\nThe evaluation results show that SEMAR can receive,\
    \ process, and visualize the data. We\nalso evaluate the data synchronization\
    \ of the LQI data at the multiple receivers from the\nsame transmitter. Figure\
    \ 18 shows the synchronized LQI data for transmitter 1 during 30 s,\nwhere LQi\
    \ for i = 1, . . . , 6 indicates the LQI data at receiver i. They are saved in\
    \ the schema\ndata storage and can be accessed from other programs through REST\
    \ API. This system can\nrun without interruptions even if it processes empty LQI\
    \ data or if error detection occurs.\nWhen the system detects an error, it sets\
    \ the LQI data to the default value. According to the\nevaluation results, the\
    \ effectiveness of integrating the SEMAR system is conﬁrmed.\nFigure 18. LQI data\
    \ of transmitter 1.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n22 of 28\n10. Evaluations\nIn this\
    \ section, we evaluate the implementation of SEMAR IoT server platform.\n10.1.\
    \ Performance Analysis\nTo evaluate the performance of SEMAR at the parameter\
    \ level, ﬁrst, we investigate the\naverage response time for MQTT data communications\
    \ when the number of IoT devices is\nincreased from 1 to 125. In the experiments,\
    \ a virtual IoT device is created in the system\ninstead of a real device. Then,\
    \ each virtual IoT device sends one message through a\ndifferent topic every second.\
    \ During this experiment, the CPU usage rate of the machine is\nalso measured.\n\
    As the response time, the time difference at a virtual IoT device from the data\
    \ transmis-\nsion to the server to the message reception from the server is measured.\
    \ For HTTP POST, it\ncan easily be obtained. When the IoT device sends data to\
    \ the server, the REST API service\nreturns the response message; however, for\
    \ MQTT, the program is modiﬁed to measure the\nresponse time where it will send\
    \ the MQTT message to the device when it stores data in\nthe storage.\nFigures\
    \ 19 and 20 show the average response time and the average CPU usage rate\nwhen\
    \ the number of virtual IoT devices is increased from 1 to 125, respectively.\
    \ The average\nresponse time is 315ms and the CPU usage rate is 74% for 125 devices.\
    \ Thus, SEMAR our\ncan handle hundreds of devices with acceptable delay and CPU\
    \ rate.\nFigure 19. Average response time for MQTT communications with different\
    \ numbers of devices.\nFigure 20. Average CPU usage rate with different numbers\
    \ of devices.\n10.2. The State-of-the-Art Comparative Analysis\nWe compare the\
    \ SEMAR IoT server platform with 14 recent research works that have\nthe similar\
    \ approach. In the comparison with the recent related works in the literature,\
    \ we\nconsider the following features to characterize each proposal:\nSensors\

    SEMAR\nVarious IoT applications\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nHTTP & MQTT\n10.2.1. IoT\
    \ Application\nAlthough the works by Hernández-Rojas et al. in [64], Marcu et\
    \ al. in [69], and\nAntunes et al. in [72] have potentials of use in various IoT\
    \ applications, they have been\nstudied in speciﬁc IoT applications. On the other\
    \ hand, SEMAR has been integrated and\nimplemented in several types of IoT applications.\n\
    10.2.2. IoT Device Management\nAll the related works provide functions to add\
    \ or remove IoT devices. Some works\nsupport device management services. Some\
    \ works include capabilities to deﬁne the sensor\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n24 of\
    \ 28\nformat for each IoT device dynamically. The work by Trilles et al. in [70]\
    \ provides the\neasy-to-use user interface to manage IoT devices. On the other\
    \ hand, SEMAR provides all\nof the functions on IoT devices.\n10.2.3. Communication\
    \ Protocol\nHTTP and MQTT are the most adopted communication protocols in IoT\
    \ application\nplatforms. In addition, Del Esposte in [67] and Antunes in [72]\
    \ introduce AMQP as another\nprotocol utilizing TCP connections. Thus, it is suitable\
    \ for server–client communications\n[73]. None of the related works reported functions\
    \ to synchronize data from several\ndevices and digital ﬁlters to process sensor\
    \ data. Only SEMAR provides both the data\nsynchronization capability and digital\
    \ ﬁlters to process data.\n10.2.4. Decision Making Assistance\nFor decision-making\
    \ assistance, a lot of works have offered functions for perspec-\ntive data analysis\
    \ based on collected data. The works by Mandava et al. in [18], by\nKamienski\
    \ et al. in [65], by Chiesa et al. in [66], and by Boursianis et al. in [71] applied\n\
    machine learning algorithms for real-time classiﬁcations, and show the results\
    \ for user\ninterfaces. The work by Hernández-Rojas et al. in [64] utilized message\
    \ notiﬁcations\naccording to a speciﬁc data threshold. The work by Trilles et\
    \ al. in [70] and our SEMAR\nincluded both of them.\n10.2.5. Interoperability\
    \ and Flexibility\nSeveral works provided interoperability. The works by Hernández-Rojas\
    \ et al. in [64],\nby Trilles et al. in [70], and SEMAR allow outer programs to\
    \ process data without changing\nthe existing program in the systems.\nSome works\
    \ consider the ﬂexibility as the IoT application platform. The works by\nHernández-Rojas\
    \ et al. in [64] and by Trilles et al. in [70] provide the capability to dynami-\n\
    cally deﬁne the sensor format and the data type for each device, similar to SEMAR.\n\
    However, any work cannot be connected with other MQTT servers. Only SEMAR\nﬂexibly\
    \ allows users to use other MQTT servers, which will allow IoT applications to\
    \ be\neasily integrated with SEMAR.\n11. Threats to Validity\nThere are two kinds\
    \ of threats to the validity of this research, which are as follows:\n•\nInternal\
    \ validity threat: validates the potential errors in the SEMAR implementation.\n\
    In this study, SEMAR is integrated with ﬁve different IoT application systems.\
    \ Each\nIoT application utilized various kinds of sensors. Possible threats may\
    \ occur when\nsubmitting invalid or incomplete data. Moreover, the integration\
    \ of SEMAR with the\nﬁngerprint-based indoor localization system requires the\
    \ synchronization of data from\neach receiver to determine the location of the\
    \ transmitter. To eliminate potential\nthreats, SEMAR checks sensor data with\
    \ the format. In addition, the data synchro-\nnization function will provide default\
    \ values for devices with no data within the data\nsynchronization timeframe.\n\
    •\nExternal validity threat: validates the generalization ability of the obtained\
    \ results. We\ncompare the results of SEMAR to those of previous IoT-related studies.\
    \ The primary\npotential external threat revealed by the comparison results is\
    \ that not all of the related\nIoT-related research provided comprehensive and\
    \ clear explanations of the proposals.\n12. Conclusions\nThis paper presented\
    \ the design and implementation of the IoT server platform for\nintegrating various\
    \ IoT application systems, called Smart Environmental Monitoring and\nAnalytical\
    \ in Real-Time (SEMAR). It offers Big Data environments with built-in functions\
    \ for\ndata aggregations, synchronizations, and classiﬁcations with machine learning,\
    \ and plug-in\nfunctions that access to the data through REST API. The platform\
    \ was implemented and\nSensors 2022, 22, 6436\n25 of 28\nintegrated with ﬁve IoT\
    \ application systems. The results conﬁrmed the effectiveness and\nefﬁciency of\
    \ the proposal.\nIn future studies, we will continue improving the platform by\
    \ implementing Rules\nEngine and Complex Event Processing (CEP) [74] for the data\
    \ processing. Rules Engine\nwill support user-deﬁned rules, actions, and notiﬁcations.\
    \ CEP will offer the real-time\ndata analysis based on rule patterns [75]. It\
    \ will control the device action or deliver\nmessages to users when rule patterns\
    \ are matched; however, these functions meet issues in\nparallelism, resource\
    \ allocations, distributed networks, and multi-rules optimizations [76],\nwhich\
    \ will be studied. Then, we will continue integrating the proposal with various\
    \ IoT\napplication systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.Y.F.P.,\

  title: Design and Implementation of SEMAR IoT Server Platform with Applications
  verbatim_quote1: In [7], we proposed the IoT system architecture for the indoor
    air quality (IAQ) system in a laboratory environment named iAQ Plus (iAQ+). It
    collects data from devices through Wi-Fi connections and stores data in the SQL
    server. The authors proposed a web portal and mobile application to manage and
    visualize the obtained data; however, the system does not offer data analysis
    functions to process sensor data.
  verbatim_quote2: In [9], Ons and Bennani proposed the IAQ system that is integrated
    with the Emoncms IoT platform for storing and visualizing air quality data, temperature,
    and humidity. The authors used a Waspmote microcontroller connected to Raspberry
    PI as sensor nodes and the MQTT service to send data.
  verbatim_quote3: However, in general, IoT application systems for smart cities have
    been designed without considering these challenges. They have been deployed independently
    and cannot be integrated with other systems.

  analysis: 'The aforementioned paper describes the development of an end-to-end automated
    irrigation management system that incorporates IoT and machine learning technologies
    and uses a digital twin (DT) architecture to optimize productivity in controlled
    environment agriculture (CEA) settings. The authors believe that this system can
    assist in achieving the goal of increasing food production in a sustainable manner
    and meeting the demands of a growing global population. However, the paper does
    not specifically discuss the use of different data types (e.g., soil moisture,
    canopy temperature, weather) in the system or how these data are collected and
    used.


    Despite this, the paper offers valuable insights into the potential benefits and
    challenges of implementing DT technology in real-time, automated irrigation management
    systems. The proposed system uses a combination of sensors, controllers, and software
    to collect data, monitor crop conditions, and make automated irrigation decisions
    based on machine learning algorithms. The authors provide a comprehensive overview
    of the system architecture, data flow, and decision-making process, making the
    information relevant to the outline point on the design and implementation of
    automated irrigation management systems.


    Overall, the paper provides a moderate level of relevance to the review''s objective
    of examining automation across the entire pipeline of the irrigation management
    system. While it does not delve deeply into the specific data types used in the
    system, it does offer a strong foundation for understanding the potential of DT
    technology in this field. With a relevance score of 0.6-0.69, the paper is moderately
    relevant and worth considering for inclusion in the review.'

    \ \nAbstract: The present article contains a study about utilizing the Digital\
    \ \nTwins concept in the field of contemporary agricultural production. Through\
    \ \nthis study, an exemplary architecture has been developed regarding the \n\
    conversion of a conventional greenhouse to a digital greenhouse. A digital \n\
    greenhouse modus operandi features a great number of advantages compared \nwith\
    \ the traditional workflow in a conventional greenhouse. The purpose of \nthe\
    \ work is to propose tools for assisting the possible reduction of the \nconsumption\
    \ of the used resources for the crops. This requires the application \nof automation\
    \ of tools for cultivation such as Controlled Environment \nAgriculture (CEA).\
    \ The article shows that the Digital Twins concept can \nimmensely contribute\
    \ towards controlling the agricultural environment and \nat the same time improve\
    \ performance and quality while reducing the \nconsumption of resources for a\
    \ variety of crops. The proposed workflow \nstarts by identifying the parameters\
    \ that need to be taken into account and \nfinally proposes several cyber and\
    \ physical tools for setting up a Digital Twin \nfor the case of a greenhouse.\
    \ The objective of this study was the development \nof a DT architecture that\
    \ would be able to optimize productivity in the context \nof CEA applications.\
    \ \n \nKeywords: Digital Twin, Cyber-Physical Systems, Simulation, Smart \nAgriculture,\
    \ Greenhouse, 4th Industrial Revolution \n \nIntroduction  \nCurrently, there\
    \ is a need to increase productivity and \nreduce the resources being consumed.\
    \ According to the \ndata and statistics, it is estimated that by 2050 the world\
    \ \npopulation will reach over 9.6 billion people. Today the \npopulation is estimated\
    \ at 7.9 billion according to the \nUN's average estimate. Agricultural production\
    \ must \nincrease food production compared to today to ensure the \nnutrition\
    \ demands of this population are met. However, \nthere are many obstacles to this\
    \ effort. Thus, arises the \nneed for applying new, state-of-the-art innovative\
    \ \ntechnologies in agricultural production systems. In this \ncontext, Digital\
    \ Twin (DT) technology comes to the \nforefront. DTs in agriculture can offer\
    \ productivity \noptimization by balancing production and resource \nconsumption\
    \ by using their prediction/forecasting ability. \nThis will be achieved through\
    \ the construction of a Digital \nTwin \narchitecture \nfor \nControlled \nEnvironment\
    \ \nAgriculture (CEA) which will optimize the following \ncrucial elements depicted\
    \ in Fig. 1. \nAccording to Asseng and Cowan calculations \n(Asseng et al., 2020;\
    \ Cowan et al., 2022), the wheat \nharvest using CEA is about 700±40 and 1940±230\
    \ \ntons/hectare/year \nwhereas \nit \nwas \nonly \n3.2 \ntons/hectare/year with\
    \ traditional open field harvest. In \naddition, according to Nicole's finding\
    \ (Nicole et al., \n2016), lettuce quality is improved by growing it in plant\
    \ \nfactories, and the improvement is observed both in the \ncolor and nutritive\
    \ value offered when consumed. \n \n \n \nFig. 1: Digital Twin architecture for\
    \ Controlled Environment \nAgriculture (CEA) \nAntreas Kantaros and Dimitrios\
    \ Piromalis / American Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences 2022, 15 (4):\
    \ 230.238 \nDOI: 10.3844/ajeassp.2022.230.238 \n \n231 \nHowever, the aforementioned\
    \ optimization procedure \nhas certain drawbacks. As the applied automation percentage\
    \ \nincreases, energy consumption increases as well, elevating \noperating costs.\
    \ Graamans et al. (2018), found that by \ncomparing the production of 1 kg of\
    \ lettuce in a greenhouse \nor plant, 70, 111, 182, and 211 kWh are required in\
    \ \ngreenhouses and 247 kWh in plants in the Netherlands, while \nin the United\
    \ Arab Emirates and Swe-den energy \nconsumption is twice as high as in the Netherlands\
    \ (in terms \nof building total energy). These data came from the study of \n\
    2 greenhouses in Sweden, one with additional artificial \nlighting and the other\
    \ without. Based on the above data, it is \nobvious that the production benefits\
    \ come into conflict with \nthe energy consumption that creates a need for optimized\
    \ \nchoices in applying CEA systems. This is where Digital \nTwin technology can\
    \ offer a potential solution. According to \nKritzinger et al. (2018); Negri et\
    \ al. (2017), DT \"utilizes \nsensible data, mathematical models and real-time\
    \ data \nprocessing to predict and optimize physical asset behavior in \neach\
    \ phase of the life cycle, in real-time.\" \nDigital Twins \nDigital twins are\
    \ virtual representations of real-time \ndata on an object or system using simulations,\
    \ engineer \nlearning, and logical reasoning to aid in decision-making \n(Piromalis\
    \ and Kantaros, 2022; Kantaros et al., 2021; \nTsaramirsis et al., 2022; Singh\
    \ et al., 2021). The operation \nof the Digital Twin is achieved through the precise\
    \ \nrepresentation of a physical object through the designed \nvirtual model.\
    \ The physical twin, for example, will \ncontain some media (e.g., sensors) for\
    \ data collection. \nThen the data are transferred to a corresponding \nprocessing\
    \ system to be applied to the digital twin. This is \nused for the subsequent\
    \ data in processing so that it is \npossible to study problems and performance\
    \ issues to \nimprove the physical object or system. Mainly the data are \ncollected\
    \ to re-apply the corresponding actions to be done \non the original physical\
    \ object. The application of Digital \nTwins in production enables the user to\
    \ decrease the \ndowntime of the equipment and at the same time increase \nproductivity\
    \ (Tao et al., 2019; Parrott and Warshaw, \n2017; Erol et al., 2020; Barricelli\
    \ et al., 2019; Liu et al., \n2021; He and Bai, 2021). \nAt the highest level,\
    \ a digital twin is an architectural \ncompilation powered by a combination of\
    \ cutting-edge \ntechnologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), Cloud \nComputing,\
    \ Edge Computing, Fog Computing, Artificial \nIntelligence, Robotics, Machine\
    \ Learning, and Big Data \nAnalytics. A Digital Twin is designed by collecting\
    \ data and \ncreating computational models for testing. This may include \nan\
    \ interface between the digital model and a real physical \nobject for sending\
    \ and receiving real-time feedback and data. \nBy combining all the necessary\
    \ digital technologies in a \ncoherent platform, a virtual representation of agricultural\
    \ \nproduction will be created consisting of natural elements, \nprocesses, systems,\
    \ resources, etc., (Lu et al., 2020; \nGrieves, 2016; Batty, 2018; Markets and\
    \ Markets, 2020; \nTao et al., 2019). \nSimulation Applications for Agriculture\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, the fundamental resources \nthat determine crop\
    \ production are water, nitrogen, \nenergy, and crop disease-tackling measures.\
    \ In addition, \ndata such as weather, soil characteristics, field hydrology,\
    \ \ncrop characteristics, sowing, and other factors should also \nbe taken into\
    \ account. For the compilation of a Digital Twin \nin agriculture and specifically\
    \ for a greenhouse, simulation \napplications are needed for the digital display\
    \ of the \ngreenhouse. Simulation applications use tailored models for \nbetter\
    \ management of specific physical object parameters to \nmake the best possible\
    \ production decisions. \nIn this context, applications from the literature were\
    \ \nsought that will offer improvement in the way crops are \nmanaged and in monitoring\
    \ the condition of crops, and for \nthe reduction of crop treatments. A crucial\
    \ factor that \nconcerns all growers is the consumption of resources. The \nconsumption\
    \ of resources used for plant production is high \nwater consumption, heating,\
    \ and ventilation. The goal of \ngrowers is to reduce this consumption as much\
    \ as possible. \nTable 1 depicts some suggested applications/systems \nfor the\
    \ Digital Twin Greenhouse that can help manage \nenergy, water, and crop health.\
    \  \nEnergy Plus \nEnergy Plus is a simulation application for engineers, \narchitects,\
    \ and researchers designed to model energy i.e., \nenergy such as heating, cooling,\
    \ ventilation, lighting, and \npower receivers during loading, and also model\
    \ the use of \nwater. Energy Plus applies detailed building physics to the \n\
    transfer of air, moisture, and heat, including radiation transfer \nand heat (convection\
    \ and conduction) transfer separately to \nsupport the modeling of radiation systems\
    \ and the calculation \nof thermal comfort measurements. It calculates light,\
    \ shading, \nand visual comfort measurements. Flexible configuration \nis supported\
    \ at the level of HVAC system components, \ninstallation cooling, and heating\
    \ as well as including a \nlarge set of HVAC component models and installations.\
    \ It \nsimulates hourly time steps to quickly manipulate system \ndynamics and\
    \ control strategies and has a programmed \nexternal interface for modeling control\
    \ sequences and \ninterfacing with other analyzes (Energy Plus, 2022). \n \nTable\

    \ \n \n232 \nTRNSYS \nTRNSYS offers a flexible graphical-based software \nenvironment,\
    \ used to simulate the behavior of transient \nsystems. It offers, like other\
    \ similar systems, evaluation of \nthe efficiency of thermal and electrical systems,\
    \ but also can \nbe used for modeling other dynamic systems, such as the \nflow\
    \ circulation or biological processes. TRNSYS consists \nof two parts. The first\
    \ is a Camera (called a kernel) that reads \nand processes the input file, repeatedly\
    \ solves the system, \ndetermines convergence, and plots the system variables.\
    \ The \nkernel also provides utilities that (among other things) \ndetermine the\
    \ thermophysical properties, invert arrays, \nperform linear regressions and interrupt\
    \ external data files. \nThe second part of TRNSYS is an extensive data library,\
    \ \nwhich models the performance of one part of the system. \nThe application\
    \ library offers approximately 150 models \nranging from pumps to multi-zone buildings,\
    \ wind \nturbines to electrolytes, weather data processors to \neconomical routines,\
    \ and basic HVAC equipment to \nemerging cutting-edge technologies (TRNSYS, 2022).\
    \ \nDSSAT (Decision Support System for \nAgrotechnology Transfer) \nThe Rural\
    \ Technology Transfer Decision Support \nSystem (DSSAT) is an application that\
    \ offers crop \nsimulation models and tools for their more efficient use. The\
    \ \ntools offer database management for soil, weather, crop \nmanagement, experimental\
    \ data, utilities, and application \nprograms. Application models simulate growth\
    \ and yield as \na function of soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics. Includes farm \n\
    management and accuracy, regional assessments of the \nimpact of climate variability\
    \ and climate change, genetic \nmodeling and reproduction selection, water use,\
    \ greenhouse \ngas emissions, and long-term viability through soil organic \n\
    carbon and nitrogen balances. Crop models require daily \nweather data, soil surface,\
    \ and profile information, and \ndetailed crop management as data. At the end\
    \ of each day, \nthe water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon balances of the \n\
    plants and the soil are updated, as well as the stage of \ngermination and reproductive\
    \ development of the crop. For \napplications, DSSAT combines crop, soil, and\
    \ weather \ndatabases with crop models and implementation programs \nto simulate\
    \ multiannual results of crop management \nstrategies (DSSAT, 2022). \nCropX \n\
    CropX application is a system that offers automation and \ncrop management with\
    \ advanced analysis technologies for \nagriculture. The system offers management\
    \ of irrigation, and \nfertilization with accurate forecasts, offering the best\
    \ possible \nresult. It processes data from the soil for an even better \npicture\
    \ of the crop and the atmosphere that surrounds the \ncrop. Thus, the system will\
    \ be able to adapt the strategies of \noptimal cultivation. It then offers an\
    \ adapted variable rate \nirrigation system based on changing soil and weather\
    \ \nconditions. It constantly adapts the specific needs of the crop \nto its development\
    \ stage (CropX, 2022). \nClimate Field View \nThe Climate Field View application\
    \ helps in making \ndecisions from crop data to maximize the yield of each \n\
    cultivated acre. The system collects, stores, and visualizes \ncritical data.\
    \ In this way, it will be possible to monitor and \nmeasure the decisions made\
    \ regarding the cultivation to \nimprove the yield and maximize the profit (Climate\
    \ Field \nView, 2022). \nAPSIM \nThe \nAgricultural \nProduction \nSystems \n\
    Simulator \n(APSIM) is internationally recognized as an extremely \nadvanced platform\
    \ for modeling and simulation of systems \ncontaining a platform that enables\
    \ the simulation of systems \nwith a variety of plant, animal, soil, climate,\
    \ and management \ninteractions. APSIM is constantly evolving, with new features\
    \ \nbeing added to APSIM Next Generation. Its development and \nmaintenance are\
    \ based on strict standards of software science \nand engineering (APSIM, 2022).\
    \ \nCropSyst \nCropSyst is a multi-year multi-crop crop simulation \nmodel developed\
    \ by a team at the Department of Biological \nSystems Engineering at Washington\
    \ State University. The \nmodel is used to study the impact of pruning system\
    \ \nmanagement on productivity (Stöckle et al., 2003). \nDigital Twin Architecture\
    \ Design and Compilation \nfor a Greenhouse \nDigital Twin's architecture development\
    \ work to \noptimize productivity is conducted through the development \nof a\
    \ controlled greenhouse environment. A greenhouse is an \nenclosed space, covered\
    \ with a permeable (transparent or \nopaque) material, which allows sunlight to\
    \ enter to heat the \ngreenhouse during the day. In general, a greenhouse is \n\
    necessary for the modification of climatic conditions internally \nin contrast\
    \ to the external environment, to plant plants, and \nproduction of plant products\
    \ regardless of the external \nclimatic conditions. In case of an unwanted temperature\
    \ rise, \nventilation is necessary, while for cold nights or days, a \nheating\
    \ system is necessary to maintain the desired \ntemperature for plant growth (Howard\
    \ et al., 2021;         \nVerdouw et al., 2021; Pylianidis et al., 2021; Tekinerdogan\
    \ \nand Verdouw, 2020; Monteiro et al., 2018; Howard et al., \n2020a; Mukhtar\
    \ et al., 2022; Borowski, 2021; Howard et al., \n2020b; Yang et al., 2022). The\
    \ necessary prerequisites for the \ncreation of a greenhouse are depicted in Fig.\
    \ 2. \nThe additional equipment required consists of the \nautomation infrastructure\

    \ humidity, automatic \ncontrol of the climatic conditions, and irrigation. \n\
    Construction of DT \nFor the proper compilation of the architecture for \ncreating\
    \ a greenhouse DT, the following elements \ndepicted in Fig. 3 must be included.\
    \ \nIn this context, Chaux's methodology based on virtual \nsimulation technology\
    \ is used for indicative development \nof the DT greenhouse architecture (Chaux\
    \ et al., 2021; \nTraoré, 2021). It proposes a strategy to modernize production\
    \ \nwith DT systems including the following elements depicted \nin Table 2. According\
    \ to Chaux’s methodology, ’The data \nnecessary for the optimization must be available\
    \ in the \ncloud and the user must download them in his/her local \ndevice. The\
    \ optimization occurs in the local device and \nthe optimal crop treatment and\
    \ climate control strategy \nare communicated to the controller for its implementation\
    \ \nthrough a gateway (Chaux et al., 2021). \nFramework. \nThis stage includes\
    \ the design of subsequent stages \nin which the developing architecture will\
    \ operate with \nspecific functions' definitions. This categorization \nincludes\
    \ the following parts with corresponding \nfunctions, i.e.: \n \n1. Greenhouse\
    \ \n \nA natural element that needs the help of DT to \noptimize production and\
    \ where after the training the \nselected strategies will be verified. \n \n2.\
    \ Controller \n \nIt is a set of measuring instrument layers, actuators, \nsensors,\
    \ monitors, and controllers for the greenhouse. \nWhich are important for the\
    \ collection of data to be used \nin DT. Then the controller exchanges data with\
    \ the \nnetwork portal to make the corresponding appropriate \ndecisions for the\
    \ crop. \n \n3. Portal \n \nIt is the software that will be used for the connection\
    \ \nbetween different network environments, i.e., at work, it \nis the connection\
    \ between the physical and digital \ncomponents. Its function is to transfer data\
    \ to storage for \nlater use. \n \n4. Storage \n \nThe data used by the simulation\
    \ (current and \nhistorical) requires space to be stored as well as for \ndecisions\
    \ made. So that the data can be processed at any \ntime and there is a record\
    \ of successful decisions to be used \nin the physical element. It is a very important\
    \ part of DT tests. \n \n5. Intelligence Layer \n \nThe Intelligence Layer organizes\

    \ \nAgricultural production systems should innovate \ntowards increasing production\
    \ while utilizing fewer \nresources to assure food security. Digital twins and\

    \ for maximizing output and ensuring \nthe world's food security.  \nThe present\
    \ work presents a step-by-step approach to the \ndevelopment of architecture regarding\

    creating an architecture that makes use of simulation \nsoftware (such as DTs)\
    \ and allows for the optimization of \nclimate control techniques connected to\
    \ crop microclimate \ncontrol. The proposed tools and actions show that it is\
    \ \npossible to implement such a practice in an already existing \ngreenhouse.\
    \ Achieving a controlled environment in \nagriculture with the help of Digital\
    \ Twins can be considered \nan essential tool to achieve productivity optimization\
    \ to \nreduce the consumption of resources as well as to immensely \ncontribute\
    \ towards the seamless food supply of the planet \n(Symeonaki et al., 2021a; 2021b;\
    \ 2019a,b; Aversa et al., \n2016a,b; Petrescu and Petrescu, 2019; Petrescu et\
    \ al., 2017). \nSuch practices propose a new innovative approach for \nvertical\
    \ integration and optimization of greenhouse \nprocesses to achieve elevated energy\
    \ efficiency and \nproduction outputs without compromising the quality of \nthe\
    \ offered products or sustainability. In this context, the \ndeveloped Digital\
    \ Twins will be able to forecast how the \nphysical twin will perform under constantly\
    \ changing \noperational conditions.  \nFuture work can be identified as the proposed\
    \ \narchitecture's constant evolution due to the introduction of \nnew software\
    \ and hardware tools that will allow swifter \ndevelopment and integration of\
    \ such practices. In this \ncontext, to confirm the capacity of the suggested\
    \ DT \narchitecture to maximize productivity, a case study must be \nimplemented\
    \ to validate the productivity increase. \nAntreas Kantaros and Dimitrios Piromalis\

    Abstract: In the future, agriculture will face the need for increasing production,\
    \ sustainability, wisdom,\nand efﬁciency, which will bring signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ to the development of modern agriculture. With\nthe gradual popularization of\
    \ 5G, advanced information technologies such as the Internet of Things\nand artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence promoted the evolution of modern agriculture to intelligent agriculture.\n\
    The 5G-based Internet of Things will play an essential role in the development\
    \ of smart agriculture.\nThis paper investigates the research progress of 5G Internet\
    \ of Things in smart agriculture. It sorts\nout the development status of 5G smart\
    \ agriculture Internet of Things in recent years. Following that,\nthe concept\
    \ of 5G smart agriculture Internet of Things is put forward. It expounds on the\
    \ connotation,\narchitecture, and enabling key technologies. According to the\
    \ key application scenarios of smart\nagriculture, practical cases are presented,\
    \ the development trend and application value of 5G smart\nagriculture Internet\
    \ of Things are shown, and the future development direction is put forward. Firstly,\n\
    the concept of smart agriculture is distinguished, and the category scenarios\
    \ of smart agriculture\nare summarized. Following that, the current review research\
    \ on 5G-IoT is analyzed. This paper\nfocuses on the analysis and summary of the\
    \ changes brought by 5G to various key scenarios in smart\nagriculture. This paper\
    \ analyzes the related key technologies and challenges, puts forward some\nkey\
    \ scientiﬁc problems, and summarizes the research ideas. Finally, the development\
    \ trend and\napplication value of 5G smart agriculture Internet of Things are\
    \ shown. The future development\ndirection is also proposed.\nKeywords: 5G; smart\
    \ agriculture; IoT; monitoring; deep learning; cloud-edge\n1. Introduction\nThe\
    \ future of agriculture is facing serious challenges as people demand higher quality\n\
    food. As shown in Figure 1, by 2050, the gap is expected to be huge, and this\
    \ will pose a\ngreat challenge to resources and the environment. Academician Zhao\
    \ Chunjiang claimed\nthat the intelligent revolution of agriculture in the form\
    \ of smart agriculture has arrived\nin the ﬁrst issue of “Smart Agriculture”.\
    \ Smart agriculture is an advanced stage of the\ndevelopment of agricultural information\
    \ from digitalization to networking and then to\nintelligence, which is a milestone\
    \ for the development of agriculture, and agriculture is\nentering stage 4.0 [1].\n\
    With the commercialization and popularization of smart 5G technology, its charac-\n\
    teristics of high speed, super-large connection, and ultra-low delay will have\
    \ a profound\nimpact on agricultural IoT. Combined with the rapid development\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence,\nedge computing, cloud services, and other ﬁelds\
    \ will achieve an epoch-making revolution\nin agricultural production mode. Smart\
    \ Agriculture and 5G-IoT smart agriculture are\nrespectively introduced below.\n\

    \ capability of 5G with low delay, high density, and large\nbandwidth provides\
    \ a communication guarantee for the application of other information\ntechnologies\
    \ in the smart agricultural Internet of Things. Smart agriculture has relied on\
    \ the\nﬁfth generation of information technology 5G, the Internet of Things, robotics,\
    \ drones, big\ndata, AI, machine learning, blockchain, and other key technologies\
    \ to transform modern\nagriculture. It realizes the deep integration of the physical\
    \ world and the information\nworld, changing the current mode of agricultural\
    \ production. Industry-oriented universal\nwide-area Internet of Things is becoming\
    \ the main force [9]. It can promote the expansion\nand upgrading of IoTs in smart\
    \ agriculture and expedite the landing application of big data\nin smart agriculture.\
    \ It is the key to the in-depth application of UAV in agriculture and is\nan important\
    \ booster for integrating artiﬁcial intelligence and robot blockchain in smart\n\
    agriculture [10].\nThe Internet of Things continues to evolve with the evolution\
    \ of information technol-\nogy and sensors. It should not only perceive and transmit\
    \ data but also have functions such\nas recognition, computation, service, semantics,\
    \ and even cognitive decision-making [11].\nThe detection, management, and maintenance\
    \ functions of the Internet of Things will\nalso gradually become intelligent\
    \ and unmanned. The in-depth integration of the Inter-\nnet of Things, big data,\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence will revolutionize the current form of\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2336\n5 of 46\nthe Internet of Things and generate huge social value\
    \ [12]. As an important part of new\ndigital infrastructure, the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) is deeply integrated with 5G, big data,\ncloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ blockchain, digital twin, and other technologies,\nand is evolving into a smart\
    \ IoT system (IoTs 2.0) [13], which is profoundly changing\nthe process of the\
    \ modern agricultural industry and promoting the rapid development of\nsmart agriculture.\n\
    In the ﬁeld of smart agriculture, the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) is\
    \ devel-\noping rapidly, but still faces many challenges. This includes the new\
    \ application of the\nagricultural scene, the transformation of the new agricultural\
    \ production mode, and the\ndeep integration with other technologies. As a basic\
    \ condition for the in-depth application\nof the agricultural Internet of Things,\
    \ 5G communication technology will promote the\nin-depth application of the agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things in smart agriculture. 5G can\nprovide MTC communication with\
    \ high reliability, low delay, and wide coverage, and its\nthree typical application\
    \ scenarios have broad prospects in smart agriculture [14]. 5G IoT\ntechnology\
    \ can be extended to the scope of current, which cannot be achieved with the\n\
    ﬁeld, making IoT depth perception of the intelligent environment perception, enlarging\n\
    the coverage of the Internet of Things of agriculture and the ascending scale,\
    \ expanding\nthe communication capacity, and realizing large-scale equipment interact\
    \ with each other\nand data sharing so as to realize the agricultural decision-making\
    \ process depth [15]. 5G-\nIoT is expected to provide real-time, on-demand, online,\
    \ reconﬁgurable, and end-to-end\ncoordinated capabilities for a variety of agricultural\
    \ applications. It can provide logically\nindependent network applications and\
    \ conﬁgure networks on demand. According to the\nfuture agricultural needs, the\
    \ integration of 5G with smart agriculture and the Internet of\nThings will be\
    \ able to achieve network characteristics, as shown in Figure 5.\nof the modern\

    \ rapid detection of crop diseases, pests, weeds, farmland\nwater quality, and\
    \ soil, provide ﬁne-grained nutrition, ventilation, and water supply for\ncrops,\
    \ and improve productivity [48,49].\nIn the 5G smart farm [50], the shading system,\
    \ fresh air system, cooling system,\nfertilization and watering system, data acquisition\
    \ system, and light supplement system\nachieved 5G control. For example, intelligent\
    \ glass greenhouse food production can also\nachieve substantial growth. Mobile\
    \ robots based on 5G can complete panoramic collection.\nAlong with the cultivation\
    \ tank of the greenhouse, it automatically completes inspection,\nﬁxed-point collection,\
    \ automatic return, automatic charging, and other actions. If there\nare obstacles\

    \ transmission based on edge computing devices and artiﬁcial intelligence, improve\n\
    quick response ability, and realize front-end intelligent decision-making [51].\

    \ With the continuous development of video acquisition equip-\nment, HD images\
    \ and videos are becoming increasingly popular. Optimizing data trans-\nmission\
    \ has always been a challenge. The integrated application of smart agriculture\
    \ based\non 5G is a big direction.\n2.2.2. Large-Scale Machine Type Communication\
    \ (mMTC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSmart agricultural IoT is the next generation\
    \ of agricultural IoT for smart agriculture.\nIt needs a depth perception of the\
    \ agricultural production process. Large-scale agricultural\nproduction scenarios\
    \ require large-scale sensing nodes to transmit data [56]. Traditional\nsensor\
    \ networks have some difﬁculties in networking reliability, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ and\ndeployment cost. However, large-scale machine-type communication based\
    \ on 5G can\nachieve a smart agricultural IoT with low cost, high reliability,\
    \ low power consumption,\nand convenient networking and deployment. For example,\
    \ NB-IoT can be deployed to\nquickly monitor soil, fertilizer, and plants in farmland.\
    \ In this way, the comprehensive\nperception and depth perception of agricultural\
    \ production can be realized, providing\nsupport for the deepening application\
    \ of smart agriculture [57].\n5G-oriented NB-IoT enables dense sensing network\
    \ deployment. Combining com-\nputer vision and other technologies can effectively\
    \ extract plant phenotypic variation\nand its related information. Moreover, machine\
    \ learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, and other\ncutting-edge technologies are used\
    \ for processing [58]. Deep learning convolutional neural\nnetworks were used\
    \ to evaluate crop phenotypic characteristics and soil conditions. Multi-\nspectral\
    \ imaging in agricultural areas is based on IoT sensors and small unmanned aerial\n\
    vehicles (UAVs). It identiﬁes plant quality and leaf diseases.\n2.2.3. Ultra-Reliable\
    \ Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSuch ultra-reliable\
    \ low-latency communication applications are generally oriented to\nmission-critical,\
    \ real-time transmission of critical data and control of major agricultural\n\
    equipment [59]. Drones based on 5G networks can achieve precision operations.\
    \ The\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n12 of 46\nﬂight trajectory and situation data\
    \ of the UAV can be returned to the 5G network UAV\nmanagement and operation platform\
    \ in real-time through the 5G network. Flight status can\nbe monitored in real-time\
    \ [60]. Through the agricultural information collected by UAV and\nsatellite remote\
    \ sensing technology, the platform can intelligently and dynamically analyze\n\
    the crop situation in the monitoring region, make a macroscopic estimation of\
    \ the real-time\nseedling situation, environmental dynamics and distribution of\
    \ crops, and output scientiﬁc\nreports [61]. According to the report, farmers\
    \ can clearly grasp the growth situation of\ncrops and soil moisture and manage\
    \ production in response to problems so as to ensure\nmore scientiﬁc and efﬁcient\
    \ farming activities.\nThe universal application of 5G will provide the communication\
    \ basis for unmanned,\nintelligent, and intelligent agricultural machinery and\
    \ equipment because 5G technology\nhas the characteristics of high speed, short\
    \ delay, low power consumption, ubiquitous\nnetwork, and scalability. It will\
    \ shine in the ﬁelds of agricultural Internet of Things,\nprecision planting,\
    \ agricultural products circulation traceability, agricultural drones, smart\n\
    farming, agricultural industry services, and so on, and promote agriculture to\
    \ be more\ninformationalized and intelligent [62,63].\n2.3. Future Trends and\
    \ Key Technologies of 5G-IoT Application in Smart Agriculture\nIt can be seen\
    \ from the above analysis that the integration of 5G and IoT has a wide\napplication\
    \ prospect in the scenario of smart agriculture. Agricultural IoT can be used\
    \ to\ncollect environmental monitoring information on crop growth and process\
    \ this information\nto develop the production plan of precision agriculture. Precision\
    \ agriculture requires\nthe network to support the connection of massive devices\
    \ and a large number of small\ndata packets. Since agricultural IoT devices are\
    \ often deployed in areas where signals are\nchallenging to reach, such as mountains,\
    \ forests, and waters, 5G can meet the requirements\nwith stronger coverage capability,\
    \ ﬂexibility, scalability, and lower power consumption,\ndelay, and cost. The\
    \ future trends of intelligent agricultural IoT facing 5G mainly reﬂect\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nCloud edge collaboration: agricultural monitoring terminal and cloud collaboration.\n\
    2.\nCloud computing/AI/big data/Internet of Things/digital twin and other agricul-\n\
    tural integration.\n3.\nVirtualization and servitization of perception/access/communication\
    \ layer, software\ndeﬁned network.\n4.\nModel-driven, cloud-native new application\
    \ (APP) development environment for\nsmart Internet of Things.\n5.\nThe deep integration\
    \ of people, information space, and physical space will form\na deep intelligent\
    \ smart agriculture and achieve a harmonious ecology of human–\nmachine symbiosis.\n\
    The key technologies of IoT applications in smart agriculture include vital informa-\n\
    tion sensor technology, phenotype information acquisition technology, phenotype\
    \ group\ndata analysis technology, phenotype group big data management and database\
    \ building\ntechnology, etc. [64,65]. All these technologies need the support\
    \ of 5G. Among them,\nthe life information sensor technology collects information\
    \ about seeds and their propa-\ngation/seed production environment and obtains\
    \ the corresponding physiological and\necological information through signal transformation\
    \ and AI data processing. Phenotypic\ninformation acquisition technology automatically\
    \ extracts important phenotypic features\nand logical relationships from massive\
    \ amounts of information to realize automatic and\naccurate identiﬁcation of phenotypic\
    \ traits. Phenotypic data analysis technology covers the\ncomplete process from\
    \ the initial data collection to the ﬁnal reﬁnement analysis. Phenotype\ngroup\
    \ big data management and database building technology are used to manage, store,\n\
    and share tabular data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n13 of 46\n3. Evolution of\
    \ Intelligent Agricultural IoT 2.0 for 5G\nIntelligent Internet of Things (IoT\
    \ 2.0) refers to a complex system that integrates “hu-\nman, information space\
    \ and physical space” [66] under the guidance of 5G and other\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and AI technologies and intelligently interconnects and serves\ncooperatively.\
    \ Among them, the new generation of AI technologies includes data-driven\ndeep\
    \ reinforcement learning intelligence, network-based swarm intelligence, hybrid\
    \ in-\ntelligence oriented by human–machine and brain–computer interaction technology,\
    \ cross-\nmedia inference intelligence, autonomous intelligent system, etc. The\
    \ “wisdom” of the\nsmart IoT system refers to the interconnection of people, information\
    \ space and physi-\ncal space, and the digitalization, IoT, servitization (cloud),\
    \ collaboration, customization,\nﬂexibility, greenness, and intelligence of the\
    \ layered and progressive system [67].\nThe Internet of Things is evolving into\
    \ the next generation. Under the role of 5G, the\nInternet of Things combined\
    \ with big data, machine learning, cloud services, and so on, will\nhave intelligent\
    \ characteristics. It can make the physical process and the information world\n\
    deep integration. The network level of the Internet of Things mainly includes\
    \ monitoring,\ndetection, computing, service, and control from bottom to top,\
    \ and these connotations will\nalso undergo profound changes.\n3.1. 5G Smart Agricultural\
    \ IoT 2.0 Architecture\nWith the rapid development of video business and various\
    \ vertical business applica-\ntions in smart agriculture, centralized data storage\
    \ and processing modes will face difﬁcult\nbottlenecks and pressures. The existing\
    \ Internet of Things architecture is difﬁcult to meet\nthe data return of big\
    \ data, which easily deteriorates network indicators and affects user\nexperience.\
    \ In this case, data processing capabilities and services need to be provided\n\
    near the edge of the network where the data are generated. With the development\
    \ of\n5G and the availability of relevant business requirements and network conditions,\
    \ edge\ncomputing has gradually achieved great development. Agricultural IoT is\
    \ evolving to\nSmart Agricultural IoT 2.0, where edge computing can alleviate\
    \ these defects of centralized\nIoT, and transfer computing tasks to the edge\
    \ service side to signiﬁcantly improve delay\nand energy consumption, especially\
    \ for delay and energy-sensitive IoT applications.\n5G IoT for smart agriculture\
    \ achieves optimal resource allocation through network\nslicing, SDN/VFN, and\
    \ other technologies. However, due to a large amount of sensing\ndata in the smart\
    \ agriculture scene, the real-time requirement is high. With the increase in\n\
    terminal computing power, the network architecture for smart agriculture will\
    \ also change.\nThe architecture of a smart IoT system is shown in Figure 11.\n\
    5G-based agricultural IoT can be implemented by deploying edge computing based\
    \ on\napplication needs. Edge computing migrates IT resources, such as computing\
    \ and storage,\nfrom traditional cloud data centers to users. IT shortens the\
    \ physical distance between\nusers and IT resources, achieves lower data interaction\
    \ delay, and saves network trafﬁc.\nThis provides users with low latency and high\
    \ stability of IT solutions. Edge computation\ndepends on edge nodes. The requirements\
    \ of edge nodes for smart agricultural IoT are\nnot strictly regulated. Compared\
    \ with the general sensor node thought and its computing\npower, the communication\
    \ ability is stronger. The deployment position is usually at the\nend of the network,\
    \ that is, the application site. After IoT edge applications are deployed,\nedge\
    \ nodes serve as extensions of remote IoT platforms on devices. Devices are managed\n\
    through cloud-edge collaboration. Edge nodes can provide computing and management\n\
    services for nearby devices, such as local management of low-latency services,\
    \ local control,\nand rule execution when disconnected from the cloud. The device\
    \ accesses the edge node\nand ﬁnally uploads data to the remote IoT platform through\
    \ the edge node, as shown in\nFigure 12.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n14 of 46\n\
    energy consumption, especially for delay and energy-sensitive IoT applications.\
    \ \n5G IoT for smart agriculture achieves optimal resource allocation through\
    \ netwo\nslicing, SDN/VFN, and other technologies. However, due to a large amount\
    \ of sensi\ndata in the smart agriculture scene, the real-time requirement is\
    \ high. With the increase\nterminal computing power, the network architecture\
    \ for smart agriculture will al\nchange. The architecture of a smart IoT system\

    \ Monitoring Terminals\nA large number of sensing devices will be deployed in\
    \ the smart agricultural IoT for\nbreeding moisture monitoring, ﬁne agriculture,\
    \ and other scenarios. How to access massive\nterminals in LPWA for 5G low-power\
    \ wide area networks [85] is a challenging problem.\nWith the continuous improvement\
    \ of the capabilities of the air interface at the access end,\nthe performance\
    \ bottleneck of the whole system is gradually reﬂected in the core end, edge\n\
    end, and other areas. Therefore, there must also be corresponding innovative technologies\n\
    at the core or edge end to meet the nearly demanding requirements of 5G IoT applications\n\
    in the future [86]. However, the existing cellular network core architecture is\
    \ not suitable\nfor the development of the Internet of Things.\nThe deployment\
    \ of 5G has created the possibility for large-scale and intensive IoT\ndeployment,\
    \ but there are also challenges concerning reliable access and data transmission\n\
    and processing, as shown in Figure 21.\n3.3. Reliable Data-Driven Detection of\

    \ and unstructured types of data. They are\nwidely used in smart agriculture scenarios.\
    \ When the sensing data are rich enough, the\ncomplex event rules can be established\
    \ through various moisture data and crop growth\nmodels to determine whether drip\
    \ irrigation and fertilization are needed [88,89]. In ﬁsh\nfarming, data collected\
    \ by various sensor devices deployed in ponds are used to determine\nwhether there\
    \ is a lack of oxygen or other complex events, and so on.\nThe detection conditions\
    \ of complex events ﬁrstly need rich physical world data, and\nenough sensing\
    \ devices need to be deployed so that various relationships can be discovered.\n\
    Second, complex computational processing power is required. For pattern matching\
    \ and\nso on, we need quick calculation and judgment. In addition, some complex\
    \ event detection\nis real-time, and these requirements become feasible with 5G.\n\
    3.3.2. Depth Detection of Pests and Diseases Based on Machine Learning\nWith the\
    \ development of information technology, methods based on machine learning\nhave\
    \ been widely used in agricultural production in recent years. Many scholars combine\n\
    image processing with pattern recognition, and widely use it in crop disease and\
    \ pest\nrecognition. The color, shape, texture, and other parameters extracted\
    \ were screened and\noptimized. The linear classiﬁer, Bayesian decision theory,\
    \ fuzzy recognition, and other\npattern recognition techniques were used to identify\
    \ and classify various crop pests and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n22 of 46\n\
    diseases, which improved the recognition accuracy. Thus, the development of agricultural\n\
    informatization and precision was further promoted [90].\nAs an important branch\
    \ of machine learning, deep learning network is becoming\na hot technology with\
    \ its powerful data analysis ability. Deep learning networks can\ncontain hundreds\
    \ of hidden layers, and the features will be transformed a lot of times.\nDeep\
    \ learning can be applied to identify crop pests and disease targets. For achieving\n\
    the relationship ﬁtting of complex sample data, the core idea is not only to automatically\n\
    extract multi-layer feature representations from a large amount of data through\
    \ a variety of\nlinear and nonlinear transformations but also to complete the\
    \ task of feature extraction and\ntransformation using supervised and unsupervised\
    \ combined training methods [91]. Due\nto the structure of a deep neural network,\
    \ the error features extracted by the previous layer\nnetwork can be weakened\
    \ to a certain extent, and the complex function can be expressed\nwith fewer parameters.\
    \ The structure of the deep neural network will be more compact,\nwhich improves\
    \ the efﬁciency and performance of the network.\nIt is obvious that the current\
    \ methods with strong pattern recognition ability are\nparticularly dependent\
    \ on a large amount of data, which requires enough data to draw\nuseful conclusions.\
    \ The traditional agricultural IoT data are limited, which is challenging to\n\
    support the data collection needs of future smart agriculture development. The\
    \ introduction\nof 5G and smart agricultural IoT provides conditions for the collection\
    \ of massive data.\n3.4. Cloud Edge Fog Computing Fusion in 5G Intelligent Agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things\nIn future smart agricultural IoT, data will be extremely\
    \ abundant, and how to conduct\nanalysis and calculation from these data to guide\
    \ modern agricultural production is an\nimportant challenge.\nDue to the limitations\
    \ of volume and battery life, many mobile devices deployed in\nagricultural production\
    \ cannot meet the requirements of these applications in terms of\ncomputing, storage,\
    \ energy, and other resources. Therefore, Mobile Cloud Computing\n(MCC) technology\
    \ has been proposed. It provides reorganized computing resources for\nmobile devices\
    \ in the cloud platform, migrates data processing and storage to the cloud,\n\
    and reduces constraints on its own resources. With the development of smart agriculture,\n\
    massive data will be generated in the future to be analyzed, processed, and stored\
    \ in the\ncentral cloud [92]. At the same time, there may be a large number of\
    \ connections between\nsensing devices, and these MCCS cannot meet the demand.\
    \ New computing methods, such\nas edge computing and fog computing, will be integrated\
    \ into the intelligent agricultural\nIoT system [93]. Edge sensors no longer need\
    \ to continuously transmit various sensing\ndata to the data center. It can judge\
    \ the sensing data on its own, contacting the data center\nonly when there is\
    \ a signiﬁcant change in the reading to decide what action to take. Cloud\ncomputing\
    \ is suitable for non-real-time, long-period data, and business decision scenarios,\n\
    while edge computing plays an irreplaceable role in real-time, short-period data,\
    \ and local\ndecision-making. Edge computing and cloud computing are two important\
    \ supports for\nthe digital transformation of the industry. Their collaboration\
    \ in the network, business,\napplication, intelligence, and other aspects will\
    \ help support the agricultural IoT to create\ngreater value. Intelligent edge\
    \ computing based on 5G power can use the cloud for large-\nscale security conﬁguration,\
    \ deployment, the management of edge devices, and the ability\nto assign intelligence\
    \ based on device type and scenario, allowing intelligence to ﬂow\nbetween the\
    \ cloud and the edge. The edge computing model in smart agriculture is shown\n\
    in Figure 22.\nSecondly, with the continuous enrichment of data in smart agricultural\
    \ IoT, the tra-\nditional forms of computing will become richer and richer. Distributed\
    \ computing based\non cloud computing, fog computing, and other forms will be\
    \ deeply integrated with 5G\ncommunication capabilities and applied to smart agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture, for wisdom in\ngreenhouse cultivation, oriented precision fertilization,\
    \ aquaculture, animal husbandry,\nand aquaculture, the scene such as plant monitoring,\
    \ needs the edge of the Internet of\nThings system IoT terminal according to the\

    \ operations, and\nlocal decisions at the same time, according to the requirement\
    \ of the center’s continuously\nupdated mathematical model and iteration. Therefore,\

    \ Agricultural IoT Application Paradigm under 5G\n4.1. Typical Application Scenarios\
    \ of 5G Smart Agricultural IoT\nThe development of 5G network will provide the\
    \ infrastructure needed for smart\nagriculture for agricultural production. The\
    \ main application scenarios include the follow-\ning aspects.\n4.1.1. Smart Farm\n\
    The two characteristics of 5G network, high speed and large connection, will help\n\
    the agricultural industry implement large-scale machine services. Centralized\
    \ control\nof environmental sensors, planters, UAVs, and other monitoring equipment\
    \ and real-\ntime data transmission. Finally, the purpose of intensive farming,\
    \ accurate fertilization,\nand reasonable irrigation is achieved [97]. Agricultural\
    \ machinery automatic agricultural\nmachinery equipment based on 5G was integrated\
    \ to achieve rapid, large-area, efﬁcient,\nand precise spraying operation [98].\n\
    4.1.2. Smart Forestry\nSmart forestry utilizes 5G network video, UAV, and other\
    \ monitoring equipment to\ncarry out forest inspection, realize the monitoring\
    \ of forest resources, forest pests and\ndiseases, wild animals and plants, forest\
    \ ﬁre prevention, and provide guide and rescue\nservices for staff and tourists\
    \ [99].\n4.1.3. Intelligent Animal Husbandry\n5G intelligent animal husbandry\
    \ can improve the production efﬁciency of animal\nhusbandry, reduce the cost of\
    \ breeding, prevent livestock epidemic and livestock loss, and\nprotect animal\
    \ husbandry ecology [100,101]. For example, the use of 5G drone technology,\n\
    wearing 5G terminals on the necks of cows, and the use of Internet of Things technology\
    \ to\nmanage yaks have brought great changes to the traditional herding work of\
    \ plateau herders.\n4.1.4. Smart Fishing Ground\n5G smart ﬁshing grounds use monitoring\
    \ equipment such as high-deﬁnition net-\nwork cameras and underwater camera systems\
    \ to carry out real-scene monitoring, aquatic\nproduct growth monitoring, and\
    \ precise bait casting to improve the safety of underwater\noperations and save\
    \ labor costs [102]. In the Marine ranch, 5G panoramic monitoring appli-\ncation\
    \ is realized through 5G coverage. The panoramic high-deﬁnition camera equipment\n\
    and 5G underwater camera system were set up to realize the 24-h panoramic monitoring\
    \ of\nthe ranch. Managers can observe the growth of aquatic products, including\
    \ underwater\nobservation, from their ofﬁces or homes through mobile phones [103].\
    \ Based on 5G technol-\nogy, the intelligent control of the production process\
    \ of Marine cash crops, including kelp\nand other seedlings, can also be realized,\
    \ making it possible to have unmanned Marine\nranching.\n4.2. Deep Sense of 5G\
    \ Smart Agriculture\n4.2.1. Agricultural 5G Image Processing\nIn smart agriculture,\
    \ a large number of scenes need to realize monitoring or identiﬁ-\ncation and\
    \ detection of various targets. With the rapid development of machine learning\n\
    technology in image processing, many problems in agriculture can be solved by\
    \ video\nmonitoring and image detection. This paper summarizes the typical application\
    \ scenarios\nof agricultural image processing, as shown in Figure 26. It mainly\
    \ includes three categories:\nplant pest and disease identiﬁcation [104,105],\
    \ crop growth analysis and detection [106],\nand livestock and aquaculture monitoring\
    \ [107,108]. Each category is divided into many\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n\

    30 of 46\nUnder the background of 5G, the smart agricultural IoT will transform\
    \ the existing\nagricultural machinery equipment and make it more intelligent.\
    \ Intelligent agricultural\nmachinery can perceive its position, surrounding environment\
    \ relationship, and the inter-\nnal working state of machinery by building machine\
    \ vision, multi-dimensional perception,\nand satellite positioning based on 5G\
    \ agricultural Internet of Things. It can achieve good\ncooperation and scientiﬁc\
    \ implementation, effectively improving the effect of agricultural\nmechanization\
    \ by controlling and operating each process. Intelligent agricultural machin-\n\
    ery 5G-based agricultural Internet of Things can realize real-time monitoring\
    \ of agricultural\nmachinery’s own condition, operating state of machinery and\
    \ tools, meteorological condi-\ntions, and operating environment. It can also\
    \ guide agricultural machinery to adjust the\noperation plan in time according\
    \ to the obtained information and effectively reduce the\nindustrial machinery\
    \ in the process of operation failure, such as machine damage, poor\nquality,\
    \ and other problems. In addition to the above, intelligent agricultural machinery\n\
    will reduce the amount of ineffective operation of industrial machinery. Energy\
    \ efﬁciency\nhas been signiﬁcantly improved. The precise operation also realizes\
    \ the precise applica-\ntion of pesticides and fertilizers and truly realizes\
    \ the requirements of energy-saving and\nenvironmental protection.\nIt is clear\
    \ that smart agriculture combined with the Internet of Things and machine\nlearning\
    \ algorithm big data can transform traditional agricultural machinery and equip-\n\
    ment, making them more intelligent. In addition, the operation of intelligent\
    \ detection\nand sensing equipment can realize the functions of agricultural machinery\
    \ positioning,\nreal-time statistics of agricultural machinery working area, and\
    \ real-time calculation of\noperation quality. The system supports a variety of\
    \ agricultural machinery operations such\nas sowing, transplanting, plant protection,\
    \ harvesting, deep loosening, and land prepara-\ntion, straw returning, and so\
    \ on. It can measure fuel consumption and obtain the working\ncondition information\
    \ of agricultural machinery in real-time. This facilitates the control\nof agricultural\
    \ production progress and facilitates the real-time control of the working\narea,\
    \ working quality, and working power consumption. Being based on geospatial remote\n\
    sensing technology, multi-sensor fusion technology, 5G technology, and big data\
    \ technology,\nthe system realizes the comprehensive upgrading of smart agricultural\
    \ machinery.\n4.3.2. Automatic Driving of Agricultural Machinery\nThe automatic\
    \ driving technology of agricultural machinery is to use high-precision\nsatellite\
    \ positioning and navigation information and controls the hydraulic system of\n\
    agricultural machinery by the controller so that the agricultural machinery can\
    \ drive\nautomatically according to the set route (straight line or curve). It\
    \ can effectively improve\nthe working accuracy, improve the land utilization\
    \ rate, reduce the labor intensity of\nmachine hands, and extend the working time\
    \ (ﬁeld work can also be carried out at night).\nMoreover, it is easy to operate\
    \ and reduces the requirement for the driving ability of the\nmanipulator [121,122].\
    \ Based on the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [123,124], a\nglobal Positioning\
    \ system (GPS) can achieve intelligent driving of all kinds of agricultural\n\
    machinery, including rice transplanters, seed drills, combine harvesters, etc.\
    \ The high-\nprecision positioning and navigation technology, image recognition,\
    \ and transmission\ntechnology are applied to the intelligent driving of these\
    \ machines to realize the precise\nnavigation of agricultural machinery driving\
    \ and automatically complete the land tillage,\nsowing, ﬁeld management, and harvest,\
    \ as shown in Figure 32.\nIntelligent agricultural machinery automatic driving\
    \ system uses satellite positioning,\nmechanical control, inertial navigation,\
    \ and other technologies so that agricultural machin-\nery, according to the planned\
    \ route, automatically adjusts the direction of travel. Operation\nprecision can\
    \ reach the centimeter level, and can be used for ditching, raking, sowing, ridge,\n\
    fertilization, spraying, harvesting, transplanting, and other agricultural operations.\n\
    Unmanned agricultural machinery has many problems to be solved, such as real-time\n\
    control, low speed, and complex scenes. Sensing data do not easily meet the needs\
    \ of\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n31 of 46\nintelligent control. The high bandwidth\
    \ and real-time performance of 5G will be able to\nmeet the above requirements\

    \ Most of the intelligence degree is low, and anti-colli-\nsion and other functions\
    \ are lacking. \nThird, the precision application control technology based on\
    \ agricultural information \nis not mature enough. During aerial spraying operations,\
    \ agricultural information such as \ncrop growth, pests, and diseases in different\
    \ operating areas were obtained by aerial re-\nmote sensing technology, and prescription\
    \ maps were generated to determine the pesti-\ncide preparations and dosage required\
    \ for aerial spraying in different areas. The precision \napplication of plant\
    \ protection UAVs was realized by variable control technology. \nAll the above\
    \ have put forward new requirements for the intelligence degree of \nUAVs, mainly\
    \ including intelligent control, precise operation, better function, and optimi-\n\
    zation of spraying equipment. For the precise control of UAVs, it is necessary\
    \ to consume \nmore abundant information to meet its control needs. Secondly,\
    \ the real-time control \nneeds to be strengthened and satisfied, and the large\

    \ \nAgricultural products have various production processes, long cycles, and\
    \ numerous \nfactors, so it is challenging to realize standardized production\
    \ and management [130]. The \nsupply chain of agricultural products is in all\
    \ stages of agriculture before, during, and \nafter production. Participants participate\
    \ in different roles of producers and consumers to \nrealize the supply and circulation\
    \ of agricultural products among agricultural producers, \nagricultural materials/agricultural\
    \ service enterprises, wholesale and retail markets, reg-\nulatory agencies, and\
    \ end consumers. It connects the production, processing, transporta-\ntion, sales,\
    \ and other links of agricultural products and integrates logistics, capital flow,\
    \ \nand information flow. It is important to establish a chain structure network\
    \ composed of \nagricultural product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers,\
    \ and end consumers \n[131]. Traditional agricultural supply chain participants\
    \ mainly use the Internet of Things \ntechnology to achieve information collection,\

    \ smart agriculture Internet of Things.\nThese new problems bring new challenges\
    \ to the application of smart agriculture.\nMany of these key issues may be partially\
    \ solved with the introduction of 5G technology.\n5G is the infrastructure of\
    \ the intelligent era. Its characteristics of “extremely high\nspeed, enormous\
    \ capacity and extremely low delay” can provide basic support for meeting\nthe\
    \ development needs of smart agriculture in the future. Compared with the 2–4G\
    \ era,\nthe demand for base stations and network control equipment has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nin 5G. The large-scale application of 5G technology not only increases\
    \ the cost of network\ninfrastructure, but also the cost of power and operation,\
    \ and maintenance is much higher\nthan that of 4G, which brings challenges to\
    \ the ﬁeld agricultural production with low added\nvalue. However, 5G technology\
    \ still has limits when it comes to applications such as virtual\nreality, intelligent\
    \ production, and driverless driving. First, the deployment of 5G base\nstations\
    \ is not balanced. As many 5G base stations are distributed in sparsely populated\n\
    areas, such as ﬁelds, agriculture, and farming, there may be only a few 5G base\
    \ stations\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n35 of 46\nin these areas, which cannot\
    \ effectively cover all of them, which brings challenges to the\npopularization\
    \ and application. Secondly, the introduction of 5G will bring a change of the\n\
    whole smart agriculture application paradigm. The architecture, perception, transmission,\n\
    computing, service, processing, and application mode of 5G Internet of Things\
    \ for smart\nagriculture will bring changes, and there will be challenges.\n5.1.\
    \ Fusion and Optimization of Sparse 5G Base Station and Heterogeneous Sensing\
    \ Network in\nSmart Agriculture\n5.1.1. Optimization of Hybrid Deployment of 5G\
    \ and Sensing Network\nAccording to the analysis, the characteristics of 5G network\
    \ in agriculture are sparse,\nuneven, and they have low coverage of network base\
    \ stations and slow deployment of\nfarm base stations in remote areas. This brings\
    \ challenges for the application of 5G in ﬁeld\nagriculture and plantation agriculture.\n\
    For this imbalance and sparsity feature, it can be conﬁgured from two aspects.\
    \ One is\nto optimize the deployment of sensing nodes, and the other is to deploy\
    \ in combination\nwith heterogeneous networks. The hybrid deployment strategy\
    \ for ﬁeld agriculture, for ex-\nample, 5G sensing nodes are deployed in key areas,\
    \ and other sensing nodes are deployed\nin other areas, and sensing deployment\
    \ optimization is realized through network resource\nvirtualization and other\
    \ technologies. When the communication nodes of large-scale in-\ntelligent agricultural\
    \ sensor networks are deployed in three-dimensional space under the\nbackground\
    \ of 5G, the traditional random node deployment mode has the problems of high\n\
    energy consumption, high cost, and node disconnection. Firstly, by taking advantage\
    \ of the\ncharacteristics of the high bandwidth of 5G communication, a hierarchical\
    \ communication\nscheme can be designed, and a hierarchical node optimal deployment\
    \ model, a communi-\ncation energy consumption model, and a fully connected sensor\
    \ information transmission\nnetwork model are established. On the premise of ensuring\
    \ the full connectivity of sensor\ncommunication network nodes in farmland, the\
    \ life cycle of communication network nodes\nis improved.\n(a) 5G sparse deployment\
    \ based on ﬁeld agricultural planting scenarios.\nCombined with the actual ﬁeld\
    \ agricultural planting scene, the 5G base station has a\nhigh working frequency\
    \ band and a large signal attenuation, and its coverage radius is only\n0.3–0.5\
    \ times that of the 4G base station. It is difﬁcult to meet the goal of low cost\
    \ and high\nbeneﬁt of network construction only by deploying a macro base station.\
    \ The micro-base\nstation has a small coverage radius and low construction cost.\
    \ In order to optimize the\ndeployment cost of 5G base stations, the heterogeneous\
    \ network architecture of “macro\nand micro collaboration” can be adopted. How\
    \ to combine smart agricultural business for\noptimal deployment is an important\
    \ issue. Heterogeneous networks can optimize the cost\nof 5G signal deployment\
    \ while realizing the coverage of agricultural operation areas and\noptimizing\
    \ the perceived cost.\n(b) Intensive deployment optimization of 5G and sensing\
    \ nodes in ﬁne agriculture.\nIn ﬁne agriculture, there are many parameters to\
    \ monitor, many types of business, and\nthe need for intensive sensing equipment,\
    \ which generates an explosion of mobile data.\nHow to realize intelligent and\
    \ efﬁcient green deployment planning of intelligent nodes such\nas base stations\
    \ and gateways with large area coverage for various intelligent agricultural\n\
    applications is one of the key issues. By deploying small base stations with lower\
    \ cost\nand closer to users, it becomes a feasible solution to construct ultra-dense\
    \ heterogeneous\nnetworks centered on monitoring objects.\n5.1.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G and Sensing Network Gateway Deployment\nPreviously, the deployment optimization\
    \ of sensing nodes and 5G base stations were\nproposed in ﬁne agriculture. In\
    \ the integration of 5G and sensing devices in deployment, it\nis necessary to\
    \ combine the collaboration of the Internet of Things gateway to realize the\n\
    high-low speed switching and transmission of sensing data.\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2336\n36 of 46\n(a) The deployment of edge gateway in the Internet of Things.\
    \ The conditions of edge\ngateway coverage and service terminal trafﬁc generator,\
    \ the factors affecting the ofﬂoad-\ning delay of computing tasks, and the constraints\
    \ of edge gateway capacity allocation.\nFollowing that, the edge gateway deployment\
    \ optimization model was established and\noptimized.\n(b) To solve the problem\
    \ of base station deployment in the Low Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN), the\
    \ received signal values of all terminal test points can be predicted\nby combining\
    \ the terminal receiving signal prediction module. Then, the prediction results\n\
    are transformed into the weight values of all terminal test points during clustering,\
    \ and\nthe terminal test points are clustered. In addition, the location of the\
    \ base station was\nadjusted to achieve the optimal coverage effect and realize\
    \ the deployment optimization in\nthe whole application scenario.\n5.2. Optimization\
    \ Control under Edge Computing in 5G Intelligent Agricultural Production\nThe\
    \ popularization and application of 5G intelligent agricultural Internet of Things\
    \ will\nbring major challenges to the traditional cloud computing model, such\
    \ as high latency and\njitter, no support for location awareness and mobility,\
    \ and non-adaptive communication\ntypes. The production of smart agriculture often\
    \ needs to deploy edge computing to\nachieve real-time computing and reasonable\
    \ allocation of resources.\n5.2.1. Automatic Phenotype Monitoring Based on 5G\
    \ Internet of Things\nBy monitoring and sensing plant growth phenotype, the analysis\
    \ of crop traits is\nof great reference signiﬁcance for cultivating crop varieties\
    \ with excellent traits such as\ndrought resistance, poison resistance, lodging\
    \ resistance, high nutrient rate, and salt and\nalkali resistance. It helps researchers\
    \ select seeds of good quality for the next generation of\nbreeding objects. There\
    \ are many common image-based phenotyping methods in the ﬁeld\nof plant phenotype.\
    \ Among them, the image recognition method based on visible light has\nlower requirements\
    \ on experimental equipment, higher practicability, and can collect large-\nscale\
    \ plant image data. Therefore, the current deep learning can be better applied\
    \ to those\nalgorithms that use visible light images. All these require high-speed\
    \ data transmission,\nand how to collect and control real-time data in multi-source\
    \ sensing devices is a problem\nworth studying. At present, the main concern of\
    \ plant leaf recognition methods based on\nvisible light images is that there\
    \ are not many kinds of recognition methods. There are many\nresearchers working\
    \ on automatic phenotypic sensing platforms, which require automatic\nsensing\
    \ data pickup. Combining the advantages of high bandwidth and dense deployment\n\
    of 5G to realize automatic measurement and real-time computation of phenotype\
    \ is a\nproblem worth studying.\n5.2.2. Intelligent Sensing Real-Time Control\
    \ for Intelligent Agricultural Machinery\nMore intelligent agricultural machinery\
    \ will participate in the future smart agriculture.\nThey can combine 5G Internet\
    \ of Things and edge computing to realize smart agricultural\nproduction. Among\
    \ them they face the real-time control of equipment, which requires\nrapid data\
    \ collection and processing.\nIn the operation of smart agricultural machinery,\
    \ sensors deployed on the roadside of\nfarmland can sense all kinds of environments\
    \ and obtain important trafﬁc information. For\nexample, ﬁxed sensors such as\
    \ vision sensors and millimeter wave sensors are installed\non the side of the\
    \ road, and the information collected by the sensors is sent to the edge\nserver\
    \ for processing to extract information such as vehicle location and vehicle trajectory.\n\
    According to the multi-source information obtained by roadside sensors, crop sensors,\n\
    and smart agricultural sensing equipment, real-time data processing is carried\
    \ out to\nanalyze the operation status and calculate the results. Mobile edge\
    \ computing provides\npowerful computing and storage capabilities. The side camera\
    \ and millimeter wave radar\nare fused based on the edge server. Through data\
    \ preprocessing, space synchronization,\ntime synchronization, and tracking algorithm,\
    \ they can cooperate with each other, jointly\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n37\
    \ of 46\nbuilding an intelligent agricultural machinery environment sensing system\
    \ to make it more\nstable and reliable.\nDuring the operation of intelligent agricultural\
    \ machinery, target tracking should focus\non the following points: (1) Object\
    \ association: radar detection should be associated with\ncamera detection, while\
    \ the current fusion detection must be associated with the existing\ntrajectory;\
    \ (2) Tracking link: appropriate ﬁlter should be selected for tracking; (3) Tracking\n\
    management: tracking object database needs to be maintained.\n5.3. Scheduling\
    \ Optimization of Heterogeneous Nodes under 5G Smart Agriculture\nHow to optimize\
    \ the scheduling of sensing nodes in different rates, resources, and\nnetworks\
    \ is a problem to be studied in the intelligent agricultural IoT under 5G.\n5.3.1.\
    \ Sense Scheduling for 5G Smart Agriculture\nUnder such circumstances, how to\
    \ optimize the deployment of network resources and\nnodes to achieve better overall\
    \ network performance is a problem worth studying.\n(a). Sensing task collaboration\
    \ based on 5G: Sensing task collaboration is a hot issue in\nsensor networks.\
    \ Based on the connectivity, coverage, survivability, and task completion\nrequirements\
    \ of the network, this paper proposes a collaboration mechanism based on\nthe\
    \ limited energy, computing, and storage capacity of the sensing nodes and the\
    \ task\ncompletion requirements. The network topology is reconstructed by adjusting\
    \ the transmit\npower of nodes, neighbor selection, sleep scheduling, or mobile\
    \ node location. The decom-\nposition, assignment, scheduling, and execution of\
    \ tasks are accomplished cooperatively by\ncoordinating the behavior of mobile\
    \ sensor nodes. Topology reconstruction optimization is\nmainly carried out in\
    \ edge nodes and load balancing. In smart agriculture, the perception\nequipment\
    \ is more diverse, and the perception task is more complex.\n(b). Cooperative\
    \ scheduling of large agricultural machinery equipment: agriculture-\noriented\
    \ large agricultural machinery includes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mutual\n\
    sensing, and task coordination of multi-aerial robots. For example, building the\
    \ social\nInternet of Things creates a dynamic social network for each object\
    \ connected to the Internet\nof Things. Social networks are extended through node\
    \ proﬁles and trust levels to ﬁnd\nobjects that contribute to IoT applications\
    \ and solve resource management problems. Assign\nsensitive tasks fairly to objects\
    \ in the social network. How to optimize the sensing task\nof massive heterogeneous\
    \ sensing devices in the Internet of Things for smart agriculture.\nIt is still\
    \ a challenge to realize the efﬁcient collection of sensing data and the maximum\n\
    efﬁciency of network resources by abstracting network resources.\n5.3.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G Network Signal Coverage Scheduling for Agricultural UAV\nIn addition to\
    \ the upstream and downstream rate, end-to-end delay of services, end-\nto-end\
    \ delay of control, and positioning accuracy, the coverage height of wireless\
    \ signals is\none of the most important requirements for 5G networks in agriculture.\n\
    According to the requirements of UAV network indicators in each scenario in IMT-\n\
    2020 (5G), Advance Group—White Paper on 5G UAV Application, the coverage height\n\
    requirements of wireless signals of networked UAV in the application ﬁeld are\
    \ shown in\nTable 9.\nOn the basis of the existing network, it is technically\
    \ feasible to deploy a small number\nof base stations for the 5G communication\
    \ requirements of agricultural UAVs. However,\nthe actual network planning still\
    \ needs to focus on several issues.\n(a) Adjacent area planning.\nIn order to\
    \ make connected UAVs ﬂy continuously in the air, in addition to seamless\n5G\
    \ wireless network signals, civil UAVs also need to be able to switch smoothly\
    \ between\ndifferent cells and different base stations. In this way, it is necessary\
    \ to cover the high\nlevel of the community to have a reasonable neighborhood\
    \ relationship. In addition, the\nUAV communication terminal needs to switch from\
    \ the low-level 5G wireless network\nto the high-level 5G wireless network when\
    \ taking off. This also requires reasonable\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n38 of\
    \ 46\nneighborhood planning between the 5G cell covering the high-rise and its\
    \ neighboring 5G\ncell. Similarly, the UAV communication terminal needs to switch\
    \ from the high-level 5G\nwireless network to the low-level 5G wireless network\
    \ when landing. It is also necessary to\nmake reasonable neighborhood planning\
    \ between the 5G cell covering the low layer and\nits adjacent high-rise 5G cell.\
    \ Its switching band is controlled at about 100 m in the air.\n(b) Interference\
    \ problem.\n5G wireless networks are also self-interfering systems. All base stations\
    \ share a band-\nwidth of 100 MHz. Therefore, it is necessary to control the coverage\
    \ of the signal through\nreasonable planning and optimization. In this way, it\
    \ is necessary to avoid discontinuous\ncoverage or blind coverage caused by insufﬁcient\
    \ signal, and to avoid interference in other\ncommunities due to over coverage.\
    \ At the same time, the mutual interference between\nthe 5G cell covering the\
    \ lower layer and the 5G cell covering the upper layer should be\navoided. Of\
    \ course, this will require a long period of experimentation and exploration.\n\

    \ Agricultural Platform\nSmart agriculture 5G-IoT faces increasing network scale\
    \ and density, dense terminal\nconnections, and higher intelligence, and the failure\
    \ rate will increase. The production\nefﬁciency of large-scale smart agriculture\
    \ is an important issue. With the integration of\n5G, many intelligent applications\
    \ will be gradually popularized. These apps are built\naround the 5G Internet\
    \ of Things. How to quickly identify the faulty node or device and\nthe self-healing\
    \ ability of the platform are important research issues.\n5.4.1. Node Fault Identiﬁcation\
    \ and Early Warning Based on Heterogeneous Sensing\nData Fusion\nCombining the\
    \ collected sensing data for computational analysis and network topol-\nogy to\
    \ identify node faults is a problem worth studying. Due to the mixed deployment\n\
    of 5G and various sensing devices, mixed data sources, multi-hop communication,\
    \ and\ntransmission route changes, how to realize the fault identiﬁcation of sensing\
    \ nodes and\npossible fault detection is an important research issue.\n5.4.2.\
    \ Research on Fault Tolerance Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\n\
    Traditional perceptual networks generally assume unreliable perception. The actual\n\
    agricultural production will appear to be all kinds of failures. Because of the\
    \ intensive\ndeployment, the cost of ensuring all reliable operations is high.\
    \ Therefore, it is worth\nstudying that fault tolerance can guarantee the normal\
    \ operation of the whole agricultural\nproduction in a certain period of time\
    \ under limited fault.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n39 of 46\n5.4.3. Self-Healing\
    \ Mechanism Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\nIn smart agriculture,\
    \ production is blocked due to the failure of the sensing equipment\nnetwork,\
    \ which affects efﬁciency. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to self-heal\
    \ after\nfaults occur, such as network topology self-healing, to guarantee node\
    \ pathways. For\nexample, perceptual repair under dense nodes. An additional example\
    \ is 5G gateway\ncoverage self-healing.\n5.5. AI Application Optimization for\
    \ 5G Intelligent Agricultural Internet of Things\nThe application of 5G brings\
    \ new opportunities for smart agriculture, which is ex-\npected to solve the problem\
    \ of data transmission and storage. With the development of\nartiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ it is an important issue to study lightweight deep artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    algorithms or platforms combined with various scenarios of smart agriculture.\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms represented by deep learning have laid the foundation\n\
    for many scenarios of smart agriculture applications. With the popularization\
    \ of 5G, the\nrange of application scenarios of smart agriculture will be greatly\
    \ expanded. However, the\ncurrent existence represented by deep learning will\
    \ face the important challenge of how to\nachieve reliable and effective operation\
    \ under the condition of small cost in the scenario of\nsmart agriculture, relying\
    \ on massive data and powerful computing power.\n5.5.1. Lightweight Deep Learning\
    \ Algorithm Based on 5G-IoT Edge Computing\nEdge computing equipment has some\
    \ computing ability, but its computing ability is\nnot enough for massive data\
    \ model training. The challenge is how to design deep learning\nor machine learning\
    \ algorithms suitable for agricultural production. Better results can\nbe obtained\
    \ by training on small sample data, reducing the amount of data transmission,\n\
    reducing the cost of communication resources, and improving the real-time accuracy,\
    \ which\nis a problem worth studying.\n5.5.2. Multi-Source Data-Sensing Machine\
    \ Learning Algorithm for Smart Agriculture\nIn the 5G scenario, sensing nodes\
    \ are densely deployed, and heterogeneous sensing\ndata need to be calculated\
    \ and analyzed to serve the upper layer. However, there are\noften low data quality,\
    \ multi-source, heterogeneous, and multi-modal sensing data, and\nchanges in network\
    \ topology. How to calculate these mixed and redundant low-quality\ndata by clustering,\
    \ statistics, Bayesian, and other machine learning methods is an important\nresearch\
    \ problem.\n5.6. 5G-IoT System Service Model for Smart Agriculture\nAn important\
    \ means to promote the implementation of smart agriculture is the in-\nformation\
    \ physical fusion system based on 5G. The typical application mode of smart\n\
    agriculture is to comprehensively perceive agricultural information through the\
    \ agricul-\ntural Internet of Things. Massive sensing devices for agricultural\
    \ IoT are deployed in the\nwhole process of agricultural production and processing.\
    \ Various information (environ-\nmental temperature and humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ carbon dioxide, images, etc.) is collected\nthrough various networks, including\
    \ 5G. Traditional agricultural models will be changed\nby means of cloud computing,\
    \ big data, edge computing, and artiﬁcial intelligence. It can\nrealize intelligent\
    \ perception, intelligent warning, intelligent decision-making, intelligent\n\
    analysis, and expert online guidance of agricultural production environment to\
    \ provide\nprecise planting, visual management, and intelligent decision-making\
    \ for agricultural\nproduction. This is to realize the intelligent management\
    \ of agricultural visual remote\ndiagnosis, remote control, disaster warning,\
    \ and so on, and gradually establish the visual\ncommunication and application\
    \ mode of agricultural information services. Relying on\nthe knowledge of agricultural\
    \ experts stored in the knowledge base, reasoning, analysis,\nand other mechanisms\
    \ were used to guide the production and circulation of agriculture\nand animal\
    \ husbandry. It promotes the transformation of traditional agriculture, which\
    \ is\nhuman-centered and relies on isolated machinery production mode, to modern\
    \ smart agri-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n40 of 46\nculture, which is based on\
    \ information and software production mode. How to construct\nan appropriate application\
    \ service paradigm and model for intelligent agriculture 5G-IoT\nis an important\
    \ issue to be studied.\n5.7. Security Issues of 5G Internet of Things for Smart\
    \ Agriculture\nThe future of intelligent agriculture is highly intelligent, informationized,\
    \ and un-\nmanned, and security issues should be a concern. Due to the application\
    \ of 5G technology,\nthere are many data ﬂows and information ﬂows which are prone\
    \ to data deception, etc.,\nwhich will lead to serious consequences, such as the\
    \ death of crops or the poor quality of\nanimal husbandry objects caused by incorrect\
    \ pesticide spraying.\nAt present, there are many research results on the security\
    \ of the Internet of Things.\nIn general, attacks in IoT applications are classiﬁed\
    \ using the following two criteria: (1)\ninternal or external attacks and (2)\
    \ passive or active attacks. Therefore, the threat model can\nbe classiﬁed into\
    \ attacks targeting privacy, authentication, conﬁdentiality, availability, and\n\
    integrity attributes based on the characteristics of attacks that attempt to compromise\
    \ IoT\nagricultural nodes, namely IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud nodes. 5G\
    \ itself is relatively\nsecure. However, due to the speciﬁc application scenarios,\
    \ the security problems of smart\nagriculture have their speciﬁc characteristics,\
    \ which require joint analysis and research.\n5.7.1. Information Traceability\
    \ of the Whole Process of Intelligent Agricultural Production\nBased on 5G Blockchain\n\
    Food safety has always been a matter of great concern to the public. The traditional\n\
    tracing system has some shortcomings, such as information opacity, data easy to\
    \ be tam-\npered with, poor security, and relative closure. In the future, the\
    \ development of 5G,\ncombined with blockchain technology and its unique advantages,\
    \ will provide a new\nsolution for the reliable traceability of the agricultural\
    \ supply chain. In combination with\nthe communication capability of 5G, blockchain\

    5.7.2. Intrusion Detection for Intelligent Agricultural Production Based on 5G\n\
    With the popularization of 5G Internet of Things in smart agriculture, the degree\n\
    of intelligent and networked agricultural production is getting higher and higher,\
    \ and\nmore and more security issues need to be paid attention to. Unique security\
    \ issues and\nvulnerabilities may arise, including network, control, communications,\
    \ services, etc. How\nto combine the agricultural production process and the structural\
    \ characteristics of 5G IoT\nto establish a security mechanism, rapid detection,\
    \ and early warning of the intrusion of\nkey steps in the production process is\
    \ an important challenge in the future.\n6. Summary\nIn the future, smart agriculture,\
    \ after 5G technology transformation and upgrading,\nwill show the following characteristics:\
    \ unmanned operation, precise production, reﬁned\ncultivation, standardized production,\
    \ and intelligent supervision. Due to its low latency,\nmassive data transmission,\
    \ and massive connectivity, 5G is contributing to the development\nof IoT in agriculture.\
    \ The combination of 5G with other technologies has spawned a number\nof agricultural\
    \ applications to reduce the environmental impact of pesticides, protect natural\n\
    resources, improve animal welfare and help farmers increase yields and save costs.\
    \ This\npaper summarizes the impact of 5G on the Internet of Things, smart agriculture,\
    \ and related\ntechnologies. The key technologies and scientiﬁc issues affecting\
    \ the development of 5G-IoT\nwere analyzed to provide some ideas for the development\
    \ of 5G in smart agriculture. The\nscope of smart agriculture is relatively large,\
    \ and many details have not been discussed\nin-depth. Further efforts will be\
    \ made in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.L., L.S. and\

    \ With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources\
    \ of data generation have increased\nexponentially. The use and processing of\
    \ this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The\
    \ concept\nof a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making\
    \ in the various aspects of daily life and also\nimprovement in the traditional\
    \ systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include\
    \ devices used for\ndata collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis,\
    \ and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital\n\
    role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many\
    \ challenges when dealing with such voluminous\nand high-speed generated data,\
    \ such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time\
    \ responses, and so on.\nProbabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved\
    \ as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this\n\
    tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used in\
    \ many smart city domains, including healthcare,\ntransportation, the environment,\
    \ energy, and industry. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review\
    \ of PDS and its\napplications in the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain\
    \ of the smart city has been explored in detail; origin, current\nresearch status,\
    \ challenges, and existing application of PDS along with research gaps and future\
    \ directions. The foremost aim of\nthis paper is to provide a detailed survey\
    \ of PDS in smart cities; for readers and researchers who want to explore this\
    \ ﬁeld; along\nwith the research opportunities in the domains.\nKeywords: Smart\
    \ city, Probabilistic Data Structure (PDS), Bloom Filter (BF), big data, Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)\n1. Introduction\nIn the early 1970s, it was a period of acceleration\
    \ in the ﬁeld of computing and data was the new term. There was\nan evolution\
    \ of relational databases between the 1980s and 1990s. The internet and IoT are\
    \ clusters of unstructured,\nsemi-structured, and structured data. In the 1990s,\
    \ there was slow or no internet in most cities. These were ordinary\ncities. Generally,\
    \ ordinary cities are deﬁned as human settlements without the use of the latest\
    \ technology at all.\nThe need for processing, storage, and analysis is required\
    \ beyond the human and technical infrastructure. This huge\nvolume and variety\
    \ of unstructured data and untapped information is spread across the networks.\
    \ The core part of\nApache Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),\
    \ consisting of the storage part, and the MapReduce\n*Corresponding author. E-mails:\

    \ [4]. As the data is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwell-structured manner, the government and public sector require technologies\
    \ and expertise to convert urban cities\nto smart cities. The research interest\
    \ in smart cities has continuously increased in the current and coming years and\n\
    it is economically justiﬁed by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21].\
    \ New inventions like the internet, the\ncloud, and IoT have increased data generation\
    \ speed as well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts\ntowns\
    \ and cities around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of\
    \ new technologies. But in the\ncurrent context, rapid population growth is creating\
    \ challenges for the government and its services. So, smart cities\nare the most\
    \ acceptable solution to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions\
    \ [146]. The emergence of\na smart city has the potential to manage all these\
    \ issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious urbanization also quickly presents\na major\
    \ challenge worldwide. Though movement from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable,\
    \ that’s why cities\npersist in facing many challenges like transport, healthiness,\
    \ air quality, agriculture, and many more [87]. Smart\ncities face many issues\
    \ like pollution, health assistance, overburden on both public and private sectors,\
    \ trafﬁc, etc.\ndue to the rapid growth in population in metropolitan cities [126].\
    \ In this connection, the problems associated with\nthese issues in cities require\
    \ ingenious solutions. They include human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration\
    \ with\ndifferent stakeholders [117].\nIn a recent survey, the United Nations\
    \ estimated that the world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to\n2050 and\
    \ that the population will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers\
    \ also stated that by\n2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in\
    \ cities, with the southeast United States experiencing the\ngreatest growth [74,275].\
    \ The extensive and rapid growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\
    has provided possible solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan\
    \ areas [13] this approach can\nbe used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness\
    \ of the city system. In this regard, the thinking or mentality of\nhumans is\
    \ required to be changed, like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for\
    \ sustainability in the smart\ncity. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management\
    \ systems are being used to improve energy efﬁciency in smart\ncities [316].\n\
    Since the advent of the coronavirus and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic,\
    \ all public and private sectors have\nbeen affected. This virus has affected\
    \ daily routines and activities like education, communication, daily movement,\n\
    labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors have worked with 50% manpower\
    \ on alternative days. Many\nsectors, like IT companies, schools, etc. have run\
    \ Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n231\ndiagnosed online.\
    \ The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life can be solved\
    \ through the smart\ncity. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to help society\
    \ and expand the resources available to individuals in areas\nsuch as healthcare,\
    \ communication, transportation, education, and many others.\nThe Government of\
    \ India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI deﬁnes smart cities\
    \ as a mission\nto conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by\
    \ allowing the development of regional zones and\nutilizing technology that directs\
    \ to smart results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings\n\
    from the Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities\
    \ plan their smart city journeys. Creating\na smart city incorporates lessons\
    \ from the smart city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works.\n\
    Consolidated at the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake\
    \ 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018\ncrores in 5 years from their selected dates.\
    \ New ﬁnancial innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution\nis\
    \ estimated to be from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs.\
    \ 185,905 Cr are tendered, 5845\nprojects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order\
    \ stages and 3145 projects worth Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The\ncities like\
    \ Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna, Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar,\
    \ and Ahmedabad are\ncovered under various smart city projects [183].\n1.1. Role\
    \ of big data in smart city\nBig Data basically stands for velocity, volume, and\
    \ variety of information, which includes complexity in terms\nof speed of data\
    \ generation, the structure of data (variety), and the amount of data to be generated.\
    \ Big data has\na number of deﬁnitions and’V’ principles to make big data processing\
    \ clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond\nthe human and traditional infrastructure\
    \ and techniques required to store, process, and analyze big data provides\nthe\
    \ solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, ICT, sensors,\
    \ and so on, big data systems are\nbecoming more efﬁcient in sophisticated data\
    \ infrastructures [170].\nThe role of big data in smart cities is heavily inﬂuenced,\
    \ particularly in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and\nprocessing data collected\
    \ from various IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart\
    \ city. These\ncities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree\
    \ and basic lifestyle. To extract important information\nfrom such huge data sets,\
    \ big data analysis is the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors\
    \ and devices in\na smart city’s various gates installed in the city is used for\
    \ better decisions. This growth in data requires efﬁcient\nstorage and handling,\
    \ which is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different\
    \ effects in\ndifferent parts of the city.\nThe protection of the general public:\
    \ The security and privacy of citizens is the main concern in smart cities.\n\
    To protect their citizens from anything mishappening within the city, various\
    \ analyses of geographical data can be\ndone. This can all be recorded through\
    \ Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and sensors installed on street lights or\n\
    trafﬁc lights. An enormous amount of data is developed and signiﬁcant expansion\
    \ is required when the desired data\ntransforms the city into a considerably safer\
    \ location.\nUrbanism: Cities are investing heavily in transforming to become\
    \ smart cities. The current needs of the city\ncan be identiﬁed through the effective\
    \ use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require development and\n\
    improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in areas where they\
    \ are needed.\nFig. 2. Inﬂuence of big data in smart cities.\n232\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nTransportation: After\
    \ Covid-19 both public and private transportation are affected after COVID-19.\
    \ Most people\nrely on their own reasoning to get to work and so on. The congestion\
    \ on the roads is increasing, so the risk of\naccidents or anything else going\
    \ wrong has also increased. To handle or manage trafﬁc on roads, the system requires\n\
    big data and well-structured data. Large data sets will also help reduce risks.\n\
    Sustainable Growth: This is also the main part of a smart city. For sustainable\
    \ growth, a huge amount of past and\npresent data is required. Likewise, storing\
    \ this data is one of the challenges for the smart city. This data is updated\n\
    on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in determining the impact of improvement\
    \ in the city.\nInfrastructure: To maintain sustainability, smart city infrastructure\
    \ needs to improve consistently. Obviously, for\nthis data, a smart city is required\
    \ and used in a good manner to improve or maintain the infrastructure.\nSo, the\
    \ role of big data in smart cities is signiﬁcant for efﬁcient and quick results.\
    \ Big data is the brain of the\nsmart city. The main challenge is the lack of\
    \ awareness of using this data to create smart solutions to fulﬁll the\nrequirements\
    \ of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of smart cities. So, to improve\
    \ the standard of living,\nthe developer needs new data processing tools and techniques.\
    \ There is computational, time, and space complexity\nby using the deterministic\
    \ data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one of the key solutions for\
    \ smart storage\nand searching of data in real-time scenarios.\nThe traditional\
    \ methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off\
    \ in space and time,\nwhich is not acceptable due to the massive amount of data.\
    \ Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional\ndata structure is\
    \ shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,\
    \ which may be\nor may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.\
    \ Since PDSs have some probabilistic compo-\nnents, they are efﬁcient in reducing\
    \ the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,\n\
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate\
    \ predictions. Hash functions are used\nto represent these data structures [246].\
    \ The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\ntesting,\
    \ and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are\
    \ two distinct features of\nPDS [136].\nThe extensive review of this paper has\
    \ found the key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart\ncities.\
    \ In this regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to\
    \ these challenges and also found new\npossibilities. In this paper, the importance\
    \ of big data in smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4),\n\
    and the detailed application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart\
    \ city projects (Section 5) and\ncommonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed.\
    \ During the survey, it was found that big data has a high\ninﬂuence on smart\
    \ cities. PDS has evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart\
    \ cities to complete\nthis tedious task of handling big data with real-time response.\
    \ PDS has been used in many smart city domains,\nincluding healthcare, transportation,\
    \ the environment, energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated\n\
    the prominent domain of smart cities, including the origin, current research status,\
    \ and existing applications of PDS,\nas well as research gaps and challenges (Section\
    \ 10).\n2. Generations of smart cities\nTo improve the standard of living there\
    \ is a need to change from rural to urban. Governments and citizens are\nincreasing\
    \ their attention in terms of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The\
    \ concept of a smart city for\nurban transformation has radically changed over\
    \ the years. The generation of smart cities has been concise (Table 1).\nBased\
    \ on analysis and study, several researchers have divided the technical advancement\
    \ in smart cities into different\ngenerations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]:\n\
    Generations 1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own\
    \ solutions in cities, it was deﬁned\nas the ﬁrst technology-driven smart city.\
    \ Due to the inﬂuential role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they\nare\
    \ criticized for their technology concerns. To improve the efﬁciency of public\
    \ and private services, the creators of\ntechnology development are encouraged\
    \ to use their own solutions in cities.\nGenerations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned\
    \ with citizens, issues like healthcare, transport, air quality, and water qual-\n\
    ity are arising. The technology and tools were developed to address such issues\
    \ in generation 2.0. The participation\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    \ in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life and local administration\
    \ was mea-\nsured by modern technology. For this, cities presented agendas and\
    \ schemes that support the execution of trendy\ntechnology.\nGenerations 3.0:\
    \ – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates\
    \ ICT into a\nsmart city. The modern city building programs were organized and\
    \ the local public participated. It was the time\nwhen the government acted as\
    \ a facility providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent\
    \ to represent\ntheir thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban\
    \ space is designed for users and their engagement.\nGenerations 4.0: – By adopting\
    \ 4.0 industrial transformation, the beneﬁts of smart cities are valued to outweigh\n\
    city costs through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates\
    \ the most useful parts of the\npast; for example, technology generation 1.0,\

    \ is over the use\nof existing resources and infrastructure.\nGenerations 5.0:\
    \ – In this generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for\
    \ developing cities.\nIt is purely based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Systems\
    \ are self-learned from past and present knowledge that\nreﬂects changes in real-time\
    \ like interest, barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled\
    \ by an\nindependent agent, which gives fast and efﬁcient results. Generations\
    \ 5.0 is the main focus on decision-making for\nurban development by using behavioral\
    \ analysis and AI [264].\n3. Ranking of smart city\nWorldwide, there are different\
    \ ranking systems based on distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular\
    \ are,\n“Liveable City Index (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable\
    \ cities” [28], “global cities” and “competi-\ntiveness cities” [266].\nThe center\
    \ smart city index is used for ranking by researchers’ organizations such as Smart\
    \ City Observatory, in\ncollaboration with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities like transportation, trafﬁc,\nstreet light\
    \ etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al.\
    \ [266] tries to identify\nthe preferences of people living with different city\
    \ ranking systems, and the top ﬁve cities in the last three years are\ngiven in\
    \ Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper Research, an analyst ﬁrm based\
    \ in the UK, has ranked the\ncities as smart cities on various factors like transportation,\
    \ energy, healthcare, connectivity between urban areas, etc.\nShanghai, Seoul,\
    \ Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among the top ﬁve global cities considered.\
    \ These cities\nmainly work on real-time data, which helps in managing the assets\
    \ and future-prooﬁng them. They also cover the\ndowntown to provide 5G and 99%\
    \ of ﬁber coverage across the city. To fully ﬁll, the needs of residents, these\
    \ smart\ncities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”, which uses ambient technologies\
    \ like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data,\nwhich come under Smart City Generation\
    \ 5.0 [20].\n4. Architecture of smart city\nSmart city development includes the\
    \ integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential\n\
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application\
    \ management. The number of smart\ncity architectures proposed over time [226].\
    \ In Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four\nlayers.\
    \ All these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive\
    \ data.\nSensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents\
    \ the sensing layer or data collection layer.\nIoT devices are used to build this\
    \ layer. This layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity,\
    \ temperature, pressure, etc. Data\ncollection on mobile devices is a huge burden\
    \ on the sensor layer, which resides under the structure. This layer\ncaptures\
    \ real-time data from sensors [26,192].\nTransmission layer: – With a variety\
    \ of communication technologies, the transfer layer carries data to higher\nlevels.\
    \ This layer acts as the spine of any smart city architecture. In this layer,\
    \ the various communication networks\nlike 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite\
    \ also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication\nis embedded\
    \ in the base station for transferring huge wireless trafﬁc [100].\nData management\
    \ layer: – This layer resides between the transmission and application layers\
    \ and is the brain of\na smart city. The functions of this layer are deception,\
    \ editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n235\nFig. 4. Layered architecture\
    \ of a generic smart city [243].\nstored information in this layer is used to\
    \ provide services to various applications in the top layer. The primary role\n\
    of this layer is to preserve data integrity, data puriﬁcation, expansion, and\
    \ optimization [285]. As the ﬁnal function\nof the data management layer, the\
    \ conclusions obtained are transferred to the application layer for proper use.\n\
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management\
    \ layer with urban residents.\nThis is the topmost layer of this architecture.\
    \ This layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications\nthat\
    \ use IoT, for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather\
    \ forecasting, etc., and intelligent\nhealth [317]. As this layer is directly\
    \ connected to the end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the\n\
    improvement of services provided.\n5. Projects contributions related to smart\
    \ city\nThe research on smart city buildings has been accomplished worldwide.\
    \ Hence, the concept of smart cities was\nintroduced. The research was conducted\
    \ by various international organizations, universities, and businesses. Various\n\
    countries, like the US and China, have also accomplished research in intelligent\
    \ urban design [156]. The smart city\nencourages the planning of metropolitan,\
    \ oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation method proposed\nby\
    \ IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards. So far, the\
    \ various initiatives, contributions,\nachievements, and projects in smart cities\
    \ are listed in Table 3 [106].\n6. Probabilistic data structure\nThe exponential\
    \ increase in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due\
    \ to the emergence\nof ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce\
    \ accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off in\nspace and time,\
    \ which is not acceptable for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless\
    \ evolution, the\ntraditional data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and\
    \ storage. PDS has given an approximation solution, which\nmay be or may not be\
    \ the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction. Since PDSs have some\
    \ probabilistic\ncomponents, they are efﬁcient in reducing the time or space trade-offs.\
    \ PDS also plays a key role in big data\nprocessing, storing nonstructural data,\
    \ helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate predictions. In general,\n\

    \ is used to query an element. To ﬁnd the position of elements in the array, put\n\
    them into the k hash functions.\nFor insertion into BF, the ﬁrst element has been\
    \ added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,\nhash functions\
    \ are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index. In the query\
    \ process, an element is\nchecked to see whether it is a member of the set or\
    \ not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the\nbits are\
    \ set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then\
    \ the answer is “deﬁnitely not”.\nProperties of BF:\n– It is impossible to false\
    \ negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is\
    \ possible (in\nstandard BF).\n– To process an element, the query time is O (k),\
    \ where k is the hash function.\n– The size of the union and intersection of BF\
    \ is the same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise\nOR and\
    \ AND are used.\nFig. 6. Insertion in bloom ﬁlter [246].\n6.2. Count min sketch\n\
    Count-min sketch (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003\
    \ [64]. It is a streaming algo-\nrithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244].\
    \ Its functionality is also hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different\nfrom\
    \ BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional array to handle a given data set, while\
    \ BF uses a 1-dimensional array\nfor representing hashed data.\n238\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 7. Count min\
    \ sketch [246].\nThe basic data structure of CMS consists of a 2-D array (d *\
    \ w) where w is used for storing the counts and it\ndepends on the maximum outputs\
    \ given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1 . . . d) and it is pairwise\n\
    independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions with the d-hash\
    \ functions. The values determined\nby the hash function are used to get the actual\
    \ occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined\nvalues by\
    \ the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The space used\
    \ by CMS is equal to the count\nof (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate\
    \ values of d and w, we get efﬁcient results with very few errors.\nUse more hash\
    \ functions for more accurate results.\nProperties of Count-Min sketch:\n– It\
    \ supports union operations on cells.\n– The query time to process is O (k), where\
    \ k is a hash function.\n– The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple\
    \ times, with a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters.\n– CMS also has various\
    \ applications like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking,\
    \ etc.\n6.3. Locality sensitive hashing\nIn 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced\
    \ the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle\nof using\
    \ low-dimensional space for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected\
    \ very carefully, which\nhas more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The\
    \ LSH has three phases. These are: the ﬁrst phase is the\npreprocessing phase\
    \ where different measures are used for mapping data, in the second phase, hash\
    \ tables are\ncreated, and in the ﬁnal phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing\
    \ identical items (Fig. 8). The similar items\nare located in the same bucket,\
    \ so the whole data is located in buckets [104].\nFig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing\
    \ framework [246].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n239\nA LSH family lshF() is deﬁned with probabilities P1 and P2, an approximation\
    \ factor c ⩾ 1, a threshold R ⩾ 0,\nand for a metric space M = (M, d). This function\
    \ lshF() maps the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions\nh: M →\
    \ S [287]. The following conditions must be satisﬁed for p, qϵM and hash function\
    \ h chosen uniformly at\nrandom from F :\n– if d(p, q) ⩽ R, then h(p) = h(q) (i.e.,\
    \ p and q collide) with probability at least P1,\n– if d(p, q) ⩾ cR, then h(p)\
    \ = h(q) with probability at most P2.\nA family is interesting when P1 ⩾ P2. Such\
    \ a family lshF() is called (R, cR, P1, P2)-sensitive.\nProperties of Locality\
    \ Sensitive Hashing:\n– The same items are hashed to the same buckets as different\
    \ items, so LSH hashes the items a number of times.\n– Cosine, similarity, and\
    \ hammering distances are examples of item LSH functions.\n– The functions of\
    \ LSH are not limited to the same standard measures commonly used for data retrieval,\
    \ overlap,\nand dice coefﬁcient [54].\n6.4. Quotient ﬁlter\nMichael Bender et\
    \ al. proposed a quotient ﬁlter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It uses less memory to sample\
    \ an element that\nis a member or not of the set. Basically, it has performed\
    \ four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member\non the set. QF uses\
    \ the single hash function for ﬁngerprint generation with a size of p (in bits).\
    \ For insertion of\nelement in QF, remainder fr ← (fp(x) mod 2r) and quotient\
    \ fp ← (⌊fp(x)2r⌋) are calculated, where fp is the\nindex of bucket and fr is\
    \ value inserted in fp bucket. QF gives the speciﬁc result to the query that is\
    \ either probably\nyes or deﬁnitely not the element of the set. There is some\
    \ probability after querying that the element is in the set, but\nactually, it\
    \ is not present (Fig. 9). The storage size is decreased with the increase of\
    \ ﬁlter size, so there is a trade-off\nbetween storage and false-positive [82].\n\
    Properties of Quotient Filter:\n– An Approximate Member Query (AMQ) ﬁlter is used\
    \ to speed up the answers in the storage system.\n– Insertion, deletion, and updating\
    \ are allowed in QF, resulting in the large usage of proxy databases.\n– There\
    \ is no need to re-hash the original key for merging and re-sizing of QF.\nPDSs\
    \ are used in many real-time applications like preserving patient data in healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc control, energy-\nsaving, and also for SEM and SAM, and many more. In\
    \ the next section, the PDS and their applications in smart\ncities and big data\
    \ will be explored in a more detailed manner.\nFig. 9. Quotient ﬁlter [89].\n\

    \ city application\nThe smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, street lights. Intelligent technologies\nlike ICT, IoT, sensors etc.\
    \ and analysis of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard\
    \ of life.\nThe important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare,\
    \ smart trafﬁc management system, smart\nemergency system, smart street light,\
    \ a virtual power plant in smart grid etc.\nPeoples have a number of reasons like\
    \ job opportunities, education, and many more to move from one city to\nanother\
    \ even in an epidemic like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed\
    \ through IoT devices like\nsensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data\
    \ is used to improve social services, infrastructure, and decision-\nmaking. This\
    \ information plays an essential role in real-time application and services in\
    \ urban areas [202].\nFig. 10. Applications of smart city.\n7.1. Smart healthcare\n\
    Healthcare is an important service to the growth and development of any smart\
    \ city. In recent years, smart health-\ncare has emerged with the growth of ICT.\
    \ It is a process of managing one’s health by a couple of doctors themselves\n\
    or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system needs to be transformed into\
    \ smart healthcare in order to become\nmore efﬁcient and convenient for patients.\
    \ With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT, AI etc. the healthcare\nindustry\
    \ have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction between doctor-patient\
    \ to new i.e. remote health mon-\nitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky, NY, USA) came up\
    \ with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some\nchallenges\
    \ while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems, equipment\
    \ are under enormous\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in\
    \ smart city\n241\npressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially, inform\
    \ decision-making process with detailed information, ad-\nditional wisdom for\
    \ nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients\
    \ run from\none department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision\
    \ diagnostics, and right measurements. With the\nincrease of population, these\
    \ challenges are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance\
    \ of\nindustrialized nations is facing vital difﬁculties regarding the quality\
    \ and cost of numerous healthcare and wellbeing\nservices [3]. Due to limited\
    \ resources, some cities are deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of\
    \ this, there is\na need for new systems, smart healthcare. In the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ healthcare, devices, the internet, and IoT can connect\npeople with each other,\
    \ as well as manage healthcare activities and resources. Smart healthcare is one\
    \ of the highest\nlevels of knowledge building in the medical ﬁeld [108]. To collect\
    \ information dynamically, liking between insti-\ntutions and healthcare, smart\
    \ healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced technologies, devices like\
    \ wearable,\nmobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare can reduce workload\
    \ at the information desk, and also Help patients\nand their wards.\n7.1.1. Evolution\
    \ of healthcare\nVarious authors and researchers in their studies are categories\
    \ the healthcare system in different generations\n(Fig. 11) (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare\
    \ 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare system are discussed\n\
    as:\nHealthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the ﬁrst evolution ‘Healthcare\
    \ 1.0’ was introduced. Due to\nlimited digital resources, it was restricted to\
    \ paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the efﬁciency\nof health\
    \ services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed the home remedy\
    \ system and the\nuntrained physicians who provide paternal care into a more sophisticated,\
    \ intelligent, and data-driven system that\ncan be called the “medical complex”.\
    \ In the 1830s the British government start piping the water to homes, when\n\
    the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171]. Shortly thereafter,\
    \ the scientiﬁc vaccine theory\nwas established [48]. In the 19th century, a better\
    \ environment for healthy living integrated measures for sanitation,\ninfection\
    \ control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been created.\nHealthcare\
    \ 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0 was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to\
    \ combine with digital\ntechnology. Industrial machinery kept working and changing.\
    \ In the 20th century to increase the productivity of\ncheap products, the automobile\
    \ industry introduces the concept of mass production [120]. The healthcare system\n\
    also follows the same. At the end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical\
    \ companies were formed [214]. A few\nyears later various antibiotics were introduced,\
    \ with the advent of mass-industrial manufacturing technology [299].\nAlso at\
    \ that time in medical education importance was given to both clinical training\
    \ and basic science education\n[93]. Hospitals are expanding, being provided by\
    \ more specialists, and doctors are being trained to deal with more\npatients\
    \ with complex conditions. The main focus is on building a part of healthcare\
    \ 2.0 [58]. The second version of\nhealthcare is aimed at improving productivity\
    \ and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited to\nwithin\
    \ the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The new version\
    \ is entrenched in response\nto the symptoms, illness, and needs of the individual.\
    \ Information was shared with other organizations with privacy\nand security.\
    \ It was electrical energy-oriented.\nHealthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare\
    \ 3.0 was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs)\
    \ were introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud\
    \ gateway. It was a step\ntowards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication\
    \ and information communication technology\n(TICT), which provides database enhancement\
    \ and additional data efﬁciency to prevent medical-related problems\n[1]. The\
    \ advent of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small\
    \ computers and fast-tracking\nenvironments, as well as large data storage [127,255].\
    \ With advanced computer technology, tomography jumped\nfrom single images to\
    \ redesigned images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and\
    \ diagnose\ndiseases earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after\
    \ diagnosis disease [85]. They have additional\ninformation gathered from e-libraries\
    \ using fast computer technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emer-\n\
    gency care and was able to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness\
    \ or symptoms of the disease. Internet\nchanges learning because much medical\
    \ literature is available at e-libraries. In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to\n\
    use technologies like BDA and IoT-based wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical\
    \ record databases.\nHealthcare 4.0: – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric healthcare\nservices with the advent\
    \ of new technologies and IoT devices [261]. This healthcare evolution is inspired\
    \ by ‘In-\n242\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\nFig. 11. Health generation.\ndustry 4.0’ by establishing personalized\
    \ healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on\n\
    smart devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL,\
    \ AI, and IoT for the detection of\ndiseases, [151]. It is the successive approach\
    \ of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their\n\
    websites and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient\
    \ records are shared with healthcare\nprofessionals via an e-Health record over\
    \ the cloud or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers\ncan be\
    \ connected. It helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also\
    \ communicate with fellow doc-\ntors for better treatment. However, data sharing\
    \ has introduced new challenges such as authentication, security, and\nauthority,\
    \ and so on, [280]. New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories,\
    \ wearable devices,\nand 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efﬁciently;\
    \ illnesses can be quickly diagnosed using a drop of\nblood; custom-designed surgery\
    \ of body joints can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D\n\
    printing [280]. Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery,\
    \ CC, CPS, information security, and\nmany more.\nHealthcare 5.0: – The era of\
    \ healthcare 5.0 began in 2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features\n\
    such as a robot nurse, a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With\
    \ latency (10–100 ms) and reliability\n(99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high\
    \ accuracy for remote connections [314], 6G communication addresses\nreliability\
    \ and latency issues in smart cities. Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall\
    \ short of meeting future\ndemands for big data connections such as holographic\
    \ communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing), games, and\ntelesurgery. This\
    \ evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine\
    \ commu-\nnication. The human-machine cooperation and participation improve the\
    \ diagnosis system and fast results. This\nsystem is more secure than its predecessors.\
    \ A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications that auto-\nmatically\
    \ collects data and removes unreliable systems from external companies. The system\
    \ is not dependent on a\nsingle-point failure due to a decentralized network [150].\n\
    The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in Table 4.\nM.\

    \ in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,\npatients, and doctors.\
    \ Smart healthcare has many beneﬁts, like disease prevention and monitoring, diagnosis\
    \ and\ntreatment, hospital management, health decision-making, and medical research.\
    \ ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data,\nand modern biotechnology are the foundations\
    \ of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors use\nLaboratory\
    \ Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for managing health\
    \ data [207].\n7.1.2. Challenges in smart healthcare\nTrusted Communication: –\
    \ Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when\
    \ real-\ntime data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections\
    \ on mobile devices such as wearable devices\nwhile moving anywhere a patient\
    \ walks, crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching\n\
    the network to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation.\
    \ The different amounts of data are\ngenerated while switching to the network,\
    \ which is dependent on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider\nand\
    \ the location of the feed. As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity,\
    \ we should also adjust the\nnetwork type and location to the value, speed, audio,\
    \ and video required by our device.\nCyber security: – Cyber security is one of\
    \ the challenges when we talk about smart healthcare. As it requires\ninternet\
    \ access and IoT devices, the data may be stolen or attackers may attack data\
    \ or modify the data. So the ﬁrst\npriority of the healthcare system is to ensure\
    \ the privacy of patients and their data. There are some private IoT-based\nnetworks\
    \ (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol) that are available, which create private\
    \ areas only accessible by\nauthorized users or devices.\nScalable Platforms:\
    \ – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare system, a scalable platform is\
    \ required. For\nthe effectiveness of a smart healthcare system to be enhanced,\
    \ it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with\npatients and their big\
    \ data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients use the devices\
    \ and system\neasily for monitoring remotely.\nCost: – Meet, the requirements\
    \ of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may\
    \ take\nless time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require\
    \ new tools and techniques for efﬁcient\nstorage and retrieval.\n244\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nData Availability:\
    \ – The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and\
    \ device identiﬁ-\ncation. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent\
    \ data. So it requires identifying the resources\nand storage management with\
    \ new technologies in healthcare systems.\nData Security: – While accessing the\
    \ data, it is mandatory that only the authorized user can access the concerned\n\
    data. It still needs to be improved.\nUnique Identiﬁcation: – In the healthcare\
    \ system, it is required to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and\nvice\
    \ versa. This is required for providing or getting the best and correct treatment.\n\
    Privacy Issue: – This is one of the major issues while we are talking about big\
    \ data and IoT devices in a smart\ncity. Many kinds of research provide many tools\
    \ and techniques. But still, it needs to be improved.\nDevice Communication: –\
    \ Machine to machine, a device to machine, and human to machine communication\
    \ is\nchallenging. Patients need a quick response to their records, medical tests,\
    \ and medical reports. A 5G/6G network\nis required for the smooth transformation\
    \ of data communication. It is cost-effective, and also required some tools\n\
    and algorithms for privacy and data exchanges.\nData Integrity: – Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of healthcare data is also challenging because it is important for\
    \ providers\nto use it in making decisions about patient care. It is also required\
    \ for information exchange between doctors and\npatients.\n7.1.3. Application\
    \ of PDS in smart healthcare\nDue to the rapid growth in the population and an\
    \ epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and overcrowded. Patients\nare struggling\
    \ to ﬁnd the doctor’s ofﬁce and pre-body check-up center. Patients and their guardians\
    \ also face the\nissue of understanding medical terms, and they need someone’s\
    \ help to get the proper information. For that, a\nproper healthcare system is\
    \ required with the use of new technologies like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one\
    \ hand, the\nIoT has beneﬁted patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance\
    \ companies. On the other hand, challenges\nhave increased. Because sensors and\
    \ IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle this data, the following\n\
    is the application of PDS which may be used in smart healthcare systems:\nData\
    \ Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous or heterogeneous,\
    \ semi-structured or unstruc-\ntured, which will result in the trafﬁc load on\
    \ switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the perfor-\nmance\
    \ of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based\
    \ Secure rule-space\nmanagement’ is proposed for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\
    \ [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash\nfunctions for security checks\
    \ and also manages the network resources to handle the trafﬁc in data. Smart healthcare\n\
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.\
    \ The security of this data is in dan-\nger. The data security features are improved\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems.\nBF is\
    \ also useful in data transmission elimination [300].\nData Sharing: – The Garbled\
    \ Bloom ﬁlter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing\
    \ for\nmultiple users [260] in the Veriﬁable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).\
    \ This scheme supports single-\nkeyword search. The author also compares his programme\
    \ with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This\nscheme helps in\
    \ doctor-patient data sharing. The multi-keyword search veriﬁcation mechanism\
    \ is introduced based\non pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare\
    \ data systems [283]. The mechanism also takes care\nof authentication and advanced\
    \ encryption with advanced privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional\n\
    calculation protocol, to compare a unit of characters and record [277].\nData\
    \ Security and Privacy-Preserving System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays\
    \ a big role in smart healthcare.\nA huge amount of data is exchanged between\
    \ machines, humans, and devices. This big data can be encrypted and\nthen stored\
    \ on a cloud so that only authenticated users can access it. There are also privacy\
    \ issues. A scheme for\nefﬁciently sharing data is proposed to address this issue.\
    \ The author uses attribute-based encryption with attribute BF\nto control access.\
    \ While transforming data or sharing sensitive information, a lot of privacy concerns\
    \ may arise. Xu\net al. propose a scheme using BF, which is privacy-preserving\
    \ for patient health information for sharing information\n[293]. The author uses\
    \ an encrypted search method that allows numerical search for encrypted data.\
    \ The BF and\nmessage veriﬁcation code are used to ﬁlter patient data and check\
    \ the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design\ncooperative privacy preservation\
    \ for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for controlling\
    \ data\naccess in the context of space and time information [162]. In space-aware,\
    \ they use MinHash-based authentication,\nand in time-aware, attribute-based encryption\
    \ is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive\nM. Kumar\

    \ with the use of Blockchain for privacy-\npreserving. In this system, one leader\
    \ elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected users and the other\n\
    for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and suspected users, which\
    \ reduces the storage space. The\nblock size of the COVID-19 status ledger with\
    \ and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12).\nFast Response and Congestion\
    \ control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like trafﬁc lights,\n\
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource\
    \ sharing and effective communication,\nall devices with different conﬁgurations\
    \ have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of\nthese\
    \ devices, the trafﬁc in the network also increases, causing difﬁculty in predicting\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. G. S. Aujla\net al. propose an approach to handle these issues.\
    \ “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Deﬁned Network (SDN)\nin Smart City Applications”\
    \ is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette ﬁrmware can be integrated into a single\
    \ network\nusing the SDN controller [22].\nIn “Software-deﬁned Content Dissemination\
    \ Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Sce-\nnarios”, [111]\
    \ introduces a new way to ﬁnd the right online distribution channel described\
    \ in the healthcare ecosys-\ntem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV)\
    \ is an emerging concept that depends on smart transport, includ-\ning ambulances\
    \ and additional healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect\
    \ to the internet, espe-\ncially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately\
    \ and contact tracing, this IoHV is helpful and is deployed\nacross a smart city\
    \ setup. All healthcare vehicles are connected to each other through different\
    \ types of links: vehicle-\nto-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure\
    \ (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),\nand cellular links [147]. To overcome\
    \ congestion and improve response, the global information of devices is stored\n\
    in the deletable BF in the proposed framework. While implementing in the real\
    \ world, there are many ambient\nintelligence challenges. Some of them related\
    \ to healthcare are listed below:\nAdopting Advance healthcare technology: Almost\
    \ all medical devices are connected to IoT devices. The man-\nagement systems\
    \ like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information, etc. are\
    \ now handled by ML and\nAI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network\
    \ of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software\ndevelopment companies.\
    \ which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.\n\
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated\
    \ while using medical devices\nand AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare\
    \ companies lack data management systems and new architec-\nture.\nRising Healthcare\
    \ cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes\
    \ the manufac-\nturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing\
    \ processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab\ntests and do regular follow-ups.\n\
    246\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nPayment\
    \ Veriﬁcation: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number of transactions\
    \ is done digitally\nand payment veriﬁcation is required. In this lieu, Pratim\
    \ et al. a lightweight payment veriﬁcation based on the\nblockchain using BF is\
    \ proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for the full\
    \ location of\na small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy\
    \ leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It\nmay allow the full site\
    \ to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insigniﬁcant liaison service for\
    \ funds available\nfrom BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the\
    \ great difﬁculty in its ability to make a computer\nwhile crashing its system.\n\
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic\
    \ Health Records (EHR)\ncollection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching\
    \ targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference,\nYuan et al. [259]\
    \ propose a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in\
    \ the cloud. They\nimprove the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To\
    \ improve search efﬁciency, the Cuckoo ﬁlter is used\nand gives a facility to\
    \ data owners for modiﬁcation (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud.\n\
    7.2. Smart transportation\nFor moving from one place to another, horses and camels\
    \ were used for a long time in society. The world has\nentered the next phase\
    \ of the movement, namely smart transport, with the advent of new technologies\
    \ and smart\ntransportation systems [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future –\
    \ it is already our present”, says Lisa Jerram, senior\nanalyst at Pike Research,\
    \ simply to make sure the easy journey is acceptable as cities become more populous\
    \ and\nface potential budget crises by building new infrastructure, as is the\
    \ case in Europe, North America and Japan, [38].\nAccording to [274], the population\
    \ of the world’s urban areas increased from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008,\n\
    and it is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.\n7.2.1. Application of smart transportation\n\
    To meet the increased demand of citizens, the easy option is to provide then better\
    \ transport services. With this\nthe growth in supply of automobile is increases,\
    \ due to that the trafﬁc congestion is also increases. The attraction to\nthe\
    \ development of smart transport system took a lot of attention to addressing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and rapid urban\ngrowth [71]. It is identiﬁed that the implementation\
    \ of smart technologies is the key factor in gaining intelligence\nand stability\
    \ [107,233]. Also several researchers shown that how this sustainability achieving\
    \ the environmental and\neconomic efﬁciency [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation\
    \ is very important in today’s society. There are\nvarious application under smart\
    \ transportation are discussed as follows:\nSmart Street Light: – Smart city should\
    \ also needs to upgrade Road street light to smart street light. It helps in\n\
    reducing the energy consumption by dimming the lights. This saved energy are then\
    \ used for other services like\npollution monitoring, update about whether, GPS\
    \ etc. and also help in signing available parking in nearby area.\nBut smart street\
    \ lights are depending on its feature and requirements, and involve a combination\
    \ of cameras and\nsensors. Sensors and Cameras are collecting the data can either\
    \ process locally if street light have computing device\nor propagate through\
    \ network. These devices can detect the movement which enable dynamic lighting\
    \ and dimming\n[102]. Chen et al. present a system which used for controlling\
    \ the street lights using TX2 device and also help in\nupdating the parking status\
    \ to users (Fig. 13).\nIntelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art\
    \ transport system is heavily inﬂuenced by\nMachine Learning (ML) and Dynamic\
    \ Range Learning (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles,\ndispatch\
    \ passengers in a safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the\
    \ various advance technologies\nlike senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302].\
    \ The huge amount of data is being generated by these IoT devices\nand sensors\
    \ which contributes to the concept of intelligent cities and the future of ITS\
    \ [312]. The techniques like\nAI, ML, and especially DRL play an important role\
    \ as an integral part of sustainable in precisely monitoring and\nmeasuring real-time\
    \ data trafﬁc ﬂow in an urban area [301,305].\nThe various applications of ITS\
    \ are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent highway in Britain, which reduces\n\
    the trafﬁc and accident rate, The CRITER system in Lyon, France, offers transportation\
    \ workers a schematic plan\nlike a map and also predicts the bottleneck points.\
    \ In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC) measure the physical\ncharacteristics\
    \ of vehicles and check and deduct charges automatically if they are in ETC. It\
    \ is useful to avoid\nillegal entry into the city. Include IoT in ITS to build\
    \ a system where communication between road facilities,\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n247\nFig. 13. Smart street light\
    \ scenario [59].\nvehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers.\
    \ The Global Positioning System (GPS) is replaced by\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) in the IoT to become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author\n\
    also discusses the services for passengers on public transport, like service range,\
    \ charging, security control, and\nadministration.\nAvailability of Parking: –\
    \ With the rapid growth of vehicles in the city, it is a trick for drivers to\
    \ ﬁnd available\nparking. This dilemma is seen as an opportunity to increase the\
    \ efﬁciency of parking facilities, thereby decreasing\nroad accidents and taking\
    \ less time to ﬁnd free space in a smart city. The troubles related to parking\
    \ and trafﬁc\ncongestion could be solved if drivers were aware in advance of the\
    \ availability of parking in the area and surround-\ning areas [39]. A smart and\
    \ automated system that can detect empty parking spaces can reduce search time,\
    \ by\nﬁnding out where parking is available and bypassing lawful information to\
    \ drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image\nprocessing system that takes video\
    \ as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block [176]. These\n\
    frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems may be improved\
    \ if the availability of data and\nthe techniques to manage this data were improved\
    \ or changed with new technologies.\nStreet lights can also play an important\
    \ role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional\nparking\
    \ (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by [59].\
    \ They use Jetson TX2, an\nNVIDIA’s Computer Uniﬁed Device Architecture embedded\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence supercomputer, which has high\npower efﬁciency. This\
    \ system works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control\
    \ system. Parking\nspace is detected by marker-based image processing using the\
    \ onboard camera of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) [67].\nTrafﬁc Control: –\
    \ The authorities are facing chaos trying to manage the trafﬁc with an increase\
    \ of vehicles on the\nroads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities\
    \ are moving toward smart trafﬁc control to manage the city’s\ntrafﬁc. To reduce\
    \ congestion in the context of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of\
    \ smart robots is to give\ninformation to avoid ideal roads and manage trafﬁc\
    \ congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal trafﬁc behaviour or\ntrafﬁc violations,\
    \ the system uses street cameras [66]. But it is not possible to install street\
    \ cameras everywhere in\nthe city. Modern cars with video storage cameras have\
    \ been introduced to control trafﬁc violations in the city. These\ncars capture\
    \ the videos in the city and report any violations that happen to the authorities.\
    \ Rathore et al. propose a\nsystem to detect the front car and road line using\
    \ the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough transform\nfor self-driving.\
    \ A violation detection algorithm is designed for the fog device smart to identify\
    \ driving violations,\nU-turns, and driving central dividers [222]. Steve Mazur\
    \ has also presented a trafﬁc control system (Fig. 14) in\n[180].\nAutomated Toll\
    \ Collection: – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use\
    \ of the cream road\nis required. The government and road contractors are working\
    \ on making the new highways and ﬂyovers in the\ncities, and contractors are installing\
    \ their toll on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters\n\
    are spending their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax.\
    \ Due to this, the parking problem, trafﬁc\n248\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nFig. 14. Smart trafﬁc control [180].\ncongestion,\
    \ and pollution are increasing near the toll plaza. Commuters are also facing\
    \ delays, which increases\nthe travel time for their journey [34]. Automatic toll\
    \ collection is on the rise nowadays, both by governments and\nresearchers. The\
    \ main concern with this automated toll collection system, the RIFD tag, is that\
    \ it is installed on\nthe windshield of vehicles. To collect the required amount,\
    \ the vehicles pass through the sensor system before the\ntollgate [134]. Regular\
    \ user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards. So that the trafﬁc at tollgates\
    \ can be\navoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an alert message based toll collection\
    \ system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU)\n[34]. This system also helps in stopping\
    \ the payment violation by send the alert message if the any vehicle violate\n\
    the toll payment. This system is totally man free and barricade free, which also\
    \ help in rush hours to handle the\ntrafﬁc [34]. As the use RIFD tags not only\
    \ the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in toll plazas [8].\nSmart\
    \ Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in smart transportation\
    \ as it is consistent with the\ndevelopment of a sustainable world [101]. In particular,\
    \ either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or a complete\nfailure [31].\
    \ Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using new technologies like\
    \ IoT, ICT etc. Some\ntourists use apps to plan their journey, but they get limited\
    \ information and priorities for travel recommendations\n[205]. Smart mobility\
    \ is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity of a smart\
    \ city. Smart\nmobility also helps in improving the trafﬁc control system by giving\
    \ access to other routes in emergencies or trafﬁc\njams. Intelligent navigators\
    \ facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances\
    \ and\ngovernment. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming\
    \ year, smart mobility transform into mobility\nas a service paradigm, like car-sharing\
    \ [205].\n7.2.2. Beneﬁts of smart transportation\nFigure 15 explores a picture\
    \ of smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many beneﬁts,\
    \ some of\nthem are discussed as.\nSmart Transportation is safer: – In smart transport\
    \ the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing trafﬁc\nand road accidents.\
    \ In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices help in monitoring the\
    \ trafﬁc situation\nand intimate the same to users for improving road safety.\n\
    Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates the\
    \ public administration by allowing\nto monitor the performance of road safety\
    \ and trafﬁc. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and\n\
    tracks where maintenance is required.\nSmart Transport is very effective: – With\
    \ better management of resources in smart transport gives more efﬁcient\nresults.\
    \ If we are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement\
    \ is required. It also provides\nbetter-quality ﬁlling rates.\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n249\nFig. 15. Smart transportation\
    \ [180].\nSmart Transportation is more cost-effective: – Smart transportation\
    \ also helps in reducing the cost by providing\nthe best shortest routes, giving\
    \ information regarding facilities available with approx distance and price, and\
    \ many\nmore. Commuters also take beneﬁt if they get affordable public transport\
    \ as compared to hiring a private CAB.\nSmart Parking Management: – In smart parking\
    \ the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of ﬁnding the avail-\nable space\
    \ for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time data\
    \ from connected devices\nand sensors.\nSmart Trafﬁc Management: – With the smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system users can get information about conges-\ntion on road.\
    \ So that they can plan their journey accordingly.\nSmart Transportation provides\
    \ instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information in-\n\
    stantly regarding the issue in the city, trafﬁc congestion, and problem areas\
    \ using trafﬁc management centers. They\nalso ensure public safety and provide\
    \ information on affordable insurance plans.\nIntegrated Ticket Systems: – It\
    \ will also provide diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent\
    \ ticket\nsystem in some local services.\n7.2.3. Challenges in smart transportation\n\
    A large number of vehicles in major cities around the world has posed major transportation\
    \ and stability chal-\nlenges, like air pollution, trafﬁc congestion and energy\
    \ problems [284]. Following are some challenges to smart\ntransportation.\nSecurity:\
    \ – Vulnerable to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers.\
    \ Cyber attacks are\nmore common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the\
    \ internet increases. The data ﬂow during the smart\ntransport management system\
    \ are may be hacked or used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication.\n\
    The security of data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During\
    \ ﬁnding the available parking space user\nshare their location, this also may\
    \ create problems in user security.\nData Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved\
    \ without their knowledge. The user’s personal identity must not be\nidentiﬁed\
    \ or traced. Data privacy in smart transport is the main concern. Under the new\
    \ law, data processing must\nhave legitimate.\nSupply Chain: – Due to epidemics\
    \ like Covid-19 the global supply chain is affected. While transportation may\n\
    face various problems during this epidemic. Due to that many businesses are affected.\
    \ When the drivers may ill and\nmove from one region to another it may cause public\
    \ health.\nEnvironmental Problem: – With the rapid growth in the automobile industry\
    \ the trafﬁc on roads also increases.\nThis may affect the air quality and water\
    \ pollution in nearby residential areas. The environmental problems caused\nby\
    \ the IoT devices are currently serious and need to be addressed urgently [180].\n\
    Health Concern: – Health concern is also one of the challenges to smart transportation.\
    \ If the transport system is\nnot connected to hospitals, then it may cause major\
    \ problems or may loss their lives in road accidents. The system\nneeds to improve\
    \ its service on road, and proper intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police\
    \ stations).\n250\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n7.2.4. Applications of PDS in smart transport\nThe trafﬁc on roads in\
    \ both rural and urban areas is increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage\
    \ the trafﬁc\nand distribute the trafﬁc load by making the transport system to\
    \ be smart. It includes smart parking, smart street\nlights, violation check on\
    \ the roads, trafﬁc control system etc.\nData Dissemination: – It means the statistical\
    \ data is transmitted or distributed to end-users. In Pursuing a\nPub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT)\
    \ project use BF to store the path information in source routing. The main scenario\n\
    of this project is general data dissemination [16].\nPrivacy Preserving: – The\
    \ IoT devices and sensors are used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data,\
    \ to\nimprove the transport system. As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive\
    \ information (like vehicle registration\nnumber, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.)\
    \ was released to the cloud. The most accurate way to protect data\nprivacy is\
    \ to encrypt data before extracting it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly\
    \ over encrypted data is a\ndesirable way to make the best use of encrypted data.\
    \ Wang et al. has proposed a brand new idea for acquiring\nmultiple keywords (compound\
    \ keywords) in random search [282]. Unlike most existing keyword search programs,\n\
    the program eliminates the requirement of a predeﬁned keyword dictionary.\n7.3.\
    \ Smart environment\nMany developed cities suffer from poor air quality as population\
    \ and industry growth rapidly. Increasing accep-\ntance of smart transport data\
    \ in smart cities around the world has provided unprecedented opportunities to\
    \ improve\nair quality management in transportation [284]. Government agencies\
    \ and residents are increasingly concerned with\nair grade, which contributes\
    \ to a wide range of human environments and human development. The most common\n\
    methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level simulations.\
    \ These standards produce disappointing\neffects that have led to aspects inﬂuencing\
    \ the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of the\nbuilding.\
    \ Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is time-consuming.\
    \ Modeling incorporated\ntesting is a new expansion to measure air pollution and\
    \ conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally,\nmaximum houses\
    \ in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140]. Liu\
    \ et al. suggested a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment\
    \ in smart cities, which predict air quality\nthat assists Staked Auto-Encoder\
    \ (SAE) [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities.\
    \ The\ninternal components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing\
    \ SAE. The total error rate is 0.46 and\nthe class accuracy of 91.22% is shown\
    \ by this model, it still needs to be improved.\nJovanovska et al. proposed and\
    \ air quality system based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and\n\
    control air pollution using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3),\
    \ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and most\nimportant PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators\
    \ of contamination that cause health risks like heart and lung\ndiseases. So,\
    \ improving the quality of air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and\
    \ health of every citizen.\n7.3.1. Challenges in smart environment\nThe major\
    \ challenges for the environment are water pollution, air quality, and radiation.\
    \ To achieve sustainable\ngrowth by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance\
    \ is needed in the world. With the development of IoT and\nsmart sensors, Smart\
    \ Environmental Monitoring (SEM) is the system for environmental monitoring, in\
    \ the latest\nyears [273]. Figure 16 shows various issues of environment like\
    \ temperature, radiation, dust, humidity, ultraviolet\nsignal etc. For establishing\
    \ the system Silvia et al. used the WSN which provides an interface between smart\
    \ sensors\nand IoT Devices [273].\nAir quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid\
    \ increase in trafﬁc and industries, air pollution is one of the primary\nconcerns\
    \ of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions\
    \ of harmful gases like CO,\nNO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted\
    \ because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality\nneeds to be checked,\
    \ and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze\
    \ the data\nto predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry\
    \ Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor\nthe local air quality [175]. Dhingra\
    \ et al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to\n\
    monitor and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based\
    \ application has various features\nlike air quality, daily forecasts, health-related\
    \ tips, and risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with\nbig\
    \ data generated from sensors, then this application has faced some computational\
    \ complexity problems. For that\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\n251\nFig. 16. Challenges in smart environment.\nDhingra et al.\
    \ have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing. The IoT is a\
    \ global system of “smart\ndevices” which can detect and communicate with the\
    \ environment and interact with users and other applications.\nQian et al. found\
    \ that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system does\
    \ not work well and\nit also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is highly\
    \ correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where\nthese systems are\
    \ leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate\
    \ data neglect Qian\net al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution\
    \ Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method\nis used to compile and integrate\
    \ air pollution data.\nWater quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality\
    \ is important in determining water safety and related pub-\nlic health [256].\
    \ Water quality parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.\nBacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion,\
    \ free chlorine, and pH are the typical parameters\nof water quality [215,219].\
    \ The various research papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water\
    \ pollution\ncontrol systems using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of\
    \ water in the lake can be predicted using an\nML-based neural network for machine-reading\
    \ which analyzes the sensed image [160]. The water is classiﬁed as\npure or polluted,\
    \ and we studied the separation of water pollution with the use of ML methods\
    \ and IoT devices [61].\nThe prediction of water quality parameters using AI and\
    \ neural networks and the amounts of sulfate or chloride\npresent in water were\
    \ studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants in water using SVM, the analysis\
    \ of big data\nand problems faced during the separation of water pollution were\
    \ discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classiﬁcation system\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ and technology used for testing and its separation from non-drinking water [41,128].\n\
    Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution was investigated, which\
    \ used IoT video surveillance and\nML tools to separate dirty and clean water\
    \ [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use, another\nfunction\
    \ which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the water suggested\
    \ [311]. Different ML models\nwere used to test the concentration of chlorophyll-A\
    \ in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water\nmanagement system\
    \ [163].\nAgriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust\
    \ agricultural production methods has ac-\ncelerated to ensure the quality and\
    \ quantity of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”,\n\
    Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the\
    \ relevant growth factor for any\nnation [210]. It also helps in product development\
    \ and sustainable growth to handle major challenges in the agricul-\nture sector\
    \ [196,239]. Ullo et al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where\
    \ the SEM system is a smart\nagricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture\
    \ sector, various factors are very important for achieving\nsustainable production,\
    \ like water level, water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc.\
    \ These features are\nincluded in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which\
    \ is monitored and controlled using IoT devices, smart\nsensors for agriculture\
    \ data capturing, and WSN to transmit data into the cloud [273].\n252\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 17. Smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system using IoT devices and sensors.\nIn the new agricultural era,\
    \ there is a growing market for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The\
    \ various\nstudies and research on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM)\
    \ are discussed, which include fertilizer con-\ntrol, crop monitoring measures,\
    \ pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system for plant growth monitoring\
    \ i.e.\n‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use a 3rd-degree regression\
    \ model and provide a prediction with a\nhigh computational complexity of 98%\
    \ accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality test to monitor\n\
    the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data [242]. In the\
    \ rice quality test, SVMs were used\nwith limited sample size and back distribution\
    \ features. The land and its size play an important role in checking the\ngrowth\
    \ level of different crop species that are either satisfactory or not. To measure\
    \ the leaf index Hosseini et al.\npropose a system with a Gaussian process model\
    \ [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a lim-\nited sample size\
    \ [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water quantity\
    \ used for plant irrigation, an\nexpert system using AI was developed [78] using\
    \ the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data\ntaken from agriculture.\
    \ UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and soil health\
    \ for phenological\ndata of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest monitoring\
    \ [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in\nthe various uses of SEM systems.\
    \ Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth of plants. Ullu\
    \ et\nal. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil, moisture,\
    \ air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the\ncontext of SEM using IoT devices,\
    \ AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while smart agricul-\n\
    ture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making, and storage management\
    \ [249]. The data is moving\nwhile performing the techniques to achieve smart\
    \ agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers and\nresearchers.\
    \ Some of them are addressed below.\n7.3.2. Challenges in smart agriculture\n\
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production\
    \ will increase 70% by the year\n2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture\
    \ have been discussed (Fig. 18) as.\nIrrigation management: – One of the objectives\
    \ of an irrigation system is to calculate the water requirement for\ncrops based\
    \ on collected data and water ﬂow without interference from humans. Irrigation\
    \ systems use dispersed\nsensors to monitor the different soils, water bodies,\
    \ vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the\nmost important\
    \ variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer can adjust\
    \ his irrigation system in\na variety of ways according to soil and weather conditions\
    \ [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n253\nFig. 18. Challenges in smart\
    \ agriculture.\nweather from almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the\
    \ new infrastructure for irrigation in a very exciting\nway. Smart IoT-operated\
    \ irrigation systems use embedded sensors in the ﬁeld to monitor soil structures,\
    \ climate,\nand agricultural irrigation conditions.\nSoil management: – Soil monitoring\
    \ is one of the most challenging agricultural activities for both businesses and\n\
    farmers. Various soil parameters like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil\
    \ management and IoT sensors can be\nused to calculate these parameters. Soil\
    \ management helps in ﬁnding the right kind of plants and helps to identify\n\
    fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop production can be affected by soil testing\
    \ due to a number of environmental\nconcerns. The process and patterns of farming\
    \ can easily be understood, if these types of problems are well deﬁned.\nCrop\
    \ production may improve and fertilization practices can be promoted based on\
    \ ﬁndings of a soil survey study for\nfarmers [37]. The moisture and humidity\
    \ sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology identiﬁes\n\
    the contaminated soil and shields the ﬁeld from over-fertilization and damage\
    \ to crops. Agricultural productivity\nand quality may increase, pollution can\
    \ be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management.\nClimate\
    \ management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use\
    \ of an IoT-enabled weather\nforecast system, farmers can determine the best time\
    \ to plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors\nattached\
    \ to the ﬁeld, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air temperature.\nOn the basis of historical results, to maximize\
    \ the yield, farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and\nirrigation\
    \ season. By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate\
    \ steps to ensure a safe\ncrop yield. Many of the right things are put together\
    \ to maintain and establish a good plant environment while living\nunder stringent\
    \ limits like airﬂow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, where for\nadvanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent\
    \ sensors and devices, this can be achieved [288].\nAccurate farming: – The traditional\
    \ method of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on phys-\n\
    ical examination. If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error\
    \ after being involved in a serious\n254\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nincident on the farm. Farmers will face various\
    \ different types of challenges while farming, like less water, ﬂoods,\nlack of\
    \ suitable planting space, and cost control. Productivity can be improved with\
    \ the use of IoT in agriculture.\nWith the use of gathered information, farmers\
    \ can organize their farming activities, including what seeds they should\nsow,\
    \ what crop yields should be expected, the time to harvest, and how much fertilizer\
    \ to use. Example: The natural\nsoil diversity of a ﬁeld is an accurate agricultural\
    \ practice. The plants can be planted thicker and the irrigation can\nbe used\
    \ sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more water. Alternatively, if\
    \ the site is used for grazing, we can\ntake more cattle than an equivalent area\
    \ with a lower level of the soil.\nNutritional management: – As the human body\
    \ needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require\naccurate nutrition.\
    \ Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the right prices and\
    \ at the right times.\nToo much and too limited nutrients for plants will affect\
    \ the environment. For example, too much phosphorus,\nammonia, or nitrogen may\
    \ reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop cycle\
    \ allows\nfor balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation\
    \ and economic costs, achieving sustainable\nagriculture, nutrition, and technology\
    \ are essential [6].\nGarbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds\
    \ is common during farming. This needs to be\ncontrolled, but in an intelligent\
    \ manner. For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which\n\
    can smartly sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network\
    \ disposal is used to read, store and\ntransmit with the help of these smart trash\
    \ cans. Garbage management can be done with the help of some smart and\nsystematic\
    \ algorithms [10].\nLivestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role\
    \ in agriculture, so they need intention, proper care,\ntimely feeding, etc. It\
    \ is a growing worldwide issue to provide enough food to the world’s people with\
    \ the grow-\ning agricultural production. As a result, the importance of livestock\
    \ management on farms is crucial to survival.\nTo improve the quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products, new technology like IoT advances is important. It\n\
    also improves the quality of livestock by allowing farmers to make decisions based\
    \ on data-driven. To monitor the\nlivestock’s welfare remotely and identify their\
    \ habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power communica-\ntion sensors\
    \ [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory rate, digestion, blood\
    \ pressure, heart rate, and\nother day and night vital signs can be checked by\
    \ farmers using connected sensors. But the data ﬂow between these\nsensors and\
    \ smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure and well\
    \ managed to get efﬁcient\nresults.\nFarm Management System (FMS): – Smart farming\
    \ promotes productivity while minimizing environmental in-\nﬂuences, but this\
    \ smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With\
    \ the help of WSN\nand GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture\
    \ the data with a small controller [199]. With the\nuse of sensors and smart devices\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the identiﬁer is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,\
    \ fertility,\nand weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,\
    \ and analysis of the farm operations can\nbe automated using an IoT-based farm\
    \ management system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and\nbusiness\
    \ operations. The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals\
    \ and pests. But also automatic\nirrigation systems can increase the water consumption\
    \ [105,137].\nTracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures\
    \ to remotely track soil structure and\nits status in accordance with the needs\
    \ of plant culture. The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked\n\
    using GPS devices and wireless network connections. The real-time data processing\
    \ is tracked and approved by\nconnecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like\
    \ the Central Monitoring Station (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The\nGPS also enables\
    \ the farmer to take actions based on notiﬁcations sent to the farm manager through\
    \ SMS or MMS.\nIt is often used in agriculture to detect precise location and\
    \ control capacity, despite it having high operating and\nmaintenance costs.\n\
    Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s crop is most important in farming.\
    \ Farmers use good seeds,\norganic fertilizers, proper watering etc. for best\
    \ results. For farmers to protect themselves from them, they use\nchemical medicines\
    \ and fertilizers, which may later affect the human body. So, it required an intelligent\
    \ system that\nprotects the crop from insects and does not affect the human body.\
    \ This can be done by plant management, which\ninvolves monitoring and recording\
    \ the welfare of the crop. The plant and its diseases can be detected using RFID\n\
    chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can process the data remotely and take necessary\
    \ steps like keeping the insects\nfrom plants. The production of rice for a speciﬁc\
    \ country with a Chinese monitoring station using SVM [152].\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n255\nFarmers can also prevent\
    \ the risk and plan their farming practices by demonstrating an effective calculation\
    \ strategy\nfor coffee fruit [68].\nWater Management: – The major challenge in\
    \ greenhouses is to determine how much water is required i.e. wa-\nter management\
    \ [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed to control the waste of water and operate\
    \ them by using a\nvariety of IoT techniques. Automated drip irrigation is used\
    \ to control the soil moisture in irrigation and storage of\nwater in greenhouses.\
    \ The farmers are checking the water levels in a water tank with their Android\
    \ phones. With\nthe use of IoT devices and sensors, the whole water management\
    \ is done like the motor is automatically started and\nstopped by checking the\
    \ level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional irrigation systems,\
    \ up to 50% of\nwater is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS) provides a\
    \ system to overcome this issue. This system helps the\nfarmers to avoid water\
    \ wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation. SIS\
    \ also transmits\nthe knowledge of the ﬁeld to the farmer using temperature and\
    \ soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their\nirrigation according to\
    \ the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture\
    \ WD-\nSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,\
    \ various consensus mechanisms\nare used, and results show a trade-off is required\
    \ between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19. Water distribution\
    \ systems chain architecture [172].\nBlockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve\
    \ agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed\na secure\
    \ data storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,\
    \ agricultural contracts, and\ninformation about farm conditions from a reliable\
    \ source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers\nand consumers\
    \ and establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps\
    \ in tracking the food\nfor timely payments to stakeholders [191].\nTo monitor\
    \ the farm and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used.\
    \ To adopt the current\ncondition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices\
    \ as they use smartphones anywhere in the world. New\ntechnologies like IoT have\
    \ the potential to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production.\
    \ To\nface the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured\
    \ by providing different IoT-based tools\nand techniques. A massive amount of\
    \ unstructured data has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to\n\
    solve issues like handling big data with real-time response.\n7.3.3. Applications\
    \ of PDS in smart environment\nEnergy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness: – To improve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness. Yousef et al.\npropose a scheme in underwater\
    \ WSN for water pollution monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step\
    \ to\nreduce the number of transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious\
    \ energy. This type of project is mainly\nused in deep water like the sea and\
    \ ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for customer’s identity and privacy-preserving\n\
    of transferred data in WDS [173]. They also suggest the optimal parameters of\
    \ BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000\n256\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nnumbers of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain,\
    \ BF is used to match the authentication of network nodes in\nproof-of-authentication(PoAuth).\n\
    High-performance communication networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers,\
    \ actuators, and base sta-\ntions that need communications between them and send\
    \ millions of data that need to deliver with high-performance\ncommunication networks.\
    \ IoT devices that may have limited power resources or limited integration areas\
    \ have an\nimportant research challenge. To increase the performance of IoT communication\
    \ networks alassery et al. propose\nan efﬁcient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF\
    \ is used to store the routing information after aggregating packets to\nsend\
    \ receiving packets to upstream routers.\nQuery Optimization: – Under the big\
    \ data domain has been developed an air monitoring system, which poses\nmajor\
    \ challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a scheme for query optimization\
    \ of air quality big data using\nBF index [211]. The efﬁciency of data collected\
    \ in the air quality monitoring system is improved. They create a\nHive data repository\
    \ in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) ﬁle format and the Row Group Index (RGI).\
    \ For basic\ndata types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash function is used and Murmur3\
    \ 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary\ntype by BF in ORC.\nPrivacy-preserving\
    \ Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation algorithm is proposed using\
    \ BF for\nprivacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing system [212].\n7.4. Smart\
    \ industry\nIn world development, industrial growth plays an important role. When\
    \ the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then\nmost people probably think that it\
    \ is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased by 18th century.\n\
    Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces various challenges\
    \ like production, distribution,\nsupply chain management etc [279]. By the year\
    \ 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy\n[80]. The industries\
    \ are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary\
    \ [24].\nPrimary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general people,\
    \ means to sell and supply the products.\nThis sector is place dependent because\
    \ the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector for\n\
    economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The example\
    \ of these sectors are farming,\nmining, and ﬁshing and they extract the raw material\
    \ like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries\nunder the primary\
    \ sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry.\nSecondary industry:\
    \ – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary industries\
    \ used this\nmaterial for construction and manufacturing the products. These industries\
    \ are used to make products like steel for\nautomobiles, textiles for cloths,\
    \ wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery is\
    \ used\nin the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.\
    \ The example of these sectors\nare consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,\
    \ manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this\nsector: Heavy\
    \ industry and Light industry.\nTertiary industry: – The product is manufactured\
    \ from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use\nby consumers.\
    \ Tertiary industries generally they are not making any products but only provide\
    \ services to consumers\nand local industries & markets. The main feature of this\
    \ sector is discussion, experiences, access, etc. The ﬁnancial\nand education\
    \ sectors are two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (ﬁnancial) and\
    \ the other (education)\nis non-proﬁtable. Examples of these sectors are banking,\
    \ educators, administrative, medical, ﬁnancial, insurance,\ntransportation retail,\
    \ wholesale, real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information\
    \ technology and\nso on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary\
    \ sector: Telecommunication, Professional, and Franchises.\nThese industries help\
    \ in growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of the country.\n7.4.1. Industry\
    \ evolution\nThe farming and handicraft economizing processes changed to be monopolized\
    \ by industry and manufacturing\nmachines in the Industry Revolution. These changes\
    \ transformed society fundamentally in terms of living and\nworking styles. In\
    \ the 18th century Britain began this process and spread all over the world. The\
    \ production of\nmanufactured goods and the use of natural resources have increased\
    \ after these technological changes [294]. The\nindustrial evolution has been\
    \ categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as given in Table 5.\nIndustry 1.0: – In\
    \ the years 1760–1850, the ﬁrst revolution was introduced with the mechanical\
    \ theme [225].\nIt used steam, coal, and water mechanization for the manufacturing\
    \ process. Production through machines had\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n257\nFig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0.\nincreased, so\
    \ the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods\
    \ [270]. It also increased the\nstandard of life by creating various goods in\
    \ massive amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam\npower\
    \ [83]. Machines, stream power, and water power played an important role in the\
    \ ﬁrst industrial revolution’s\ngrowth. If we talk about the developing sectors\
    \ in this revolution, textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines,\ncement,\
    \ iron industry, gaslighting, transportation, agriculture, railways, and many\
    \ more are existing there [291].\nIndustry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution\
    \ was introduced with industrialization [131]. With the adop-\ntion of new technologies\
    \ like telephone, electric power, sewage, internal combustion engine, etc. this\
    \ revolution\nmanufactured mass production. The sectors that are developed in\
    \ Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper\nmaking, petroleum, automobile,\
    \ fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electriﬁcation, machine tools, telecommunica-\n\
    tions, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs in America, Britain, and Germany\
    \ [193].\nIndustry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013, the industrial revolution ‘Industry\
    \ 3.0’ was started. In this industry the\nproduction was automatically done without\
    \ human interference so, the production sector grew in the engineering\nﬁeld.\
    \ The automation was fully computerized, which increases the efﬁciency and reliability\
    \ of the industrial system.\nBut automation also affects employment. With the\
    \ growth in technology, many industries start using robots and\nreducing manpower.\
    \ Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated circuits and give\
    \ accurate and efﬁ-\ncient results. Robots can do painting, welding, testing,\
    \ labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of\nRobotics\
    \ there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51].\nIndustry 4.0:\
    \ – In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was ﬁrst proposed by the\
    \ German government. In\nthis revolutionary trend, computerization is used in\
    \ manufacturing [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed\nand all systems\
    \ are communicated using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278].\
    \ These IoT\ndevices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.\
    \ This industry transform information\nthrough Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The\
    \ key components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big\nData, Cyber\
    \ Security, Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry\
    \ 4.0 as “smart manufac-\nturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged\
    \ with the aim of achieving mass production and increasing\nproductivity using\
    \ innovative technologies i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213].\nIndustry\
    \ 5.0: – This revolution in the industry is declared by the European Commission,\
    \ after discussions with\nvarious funding agencies, and organizations in Research\
    \ and Innovation workshops in January 2021. To provide\nservices to humanity this\
    \ industry focuses on and highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain\
    \ concept\nto integrate the generated data from different industries. To achieve\
    \ social goals like employment, the standard of\nliving and development this industry\
    \ plays a key role [43].\nIndustry 5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version\
    \ of industry 4.0. With growing technology, artiﬁcial\nintelligence uses in industries\
    \ also improved. The capability of humans, interaction with computers, and robot\n\
    workers gives efﬁcient and effective results [279]. This industry proposed the\
    \ 3D techniques (like 3D printing or\nadditive manufacturing is used for creating\
    \ 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80].\n258\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    industries.\nNew and untested\ntechnologies\n7.4.2. Challenges in smart industry\n\
    Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the smart industry a huge\
    \ amount of data is moving\nbetween IoT devices. The security of data is also\
    \ a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and\nsafe from unauthorized\
    \ access is also a challenge to the industry.\nData Management: – This is also\
    \ the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over the network\n\
    and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good manner to access\
    \ and get efﬁcient results.\nStorage: – Storage of industrial big data is very\
    \ tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various\nresources\
    \ IoT devices are scattered and not ﬁltered. The storage of that type of data\
    \ is not easy.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n259\n7.4.3. Applications of PDS in smart industry\nRemove ambiguity: –\
    \ The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed\
    \ a technique\n“Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is\
    \ time and space-efﬁcient. They use BF in this tech-\nnique in each node, for\
    \ reducing data duplication. For efﬁcient detect and remove duplicate data [57]\
    \ proposed a\nnew data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’.\n\
    Validation: – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption\
    \ and bypass the unneces-\nsary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This\
    \ process is space-efﬁcient.\n7.5. Smart energy\nSmart energy plays an important\
    \ role in solving the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare,\n\
    agriculture, the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The\
    \ energy-saving systems have al-\nready been developed in various cities and buildings,\
    \ in the last few years. A lot of studies for efﬁcient energy have\nalready been\
    \ done [142]. Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to\
    \ use the terms “Smart\nEnergy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\
    \ Smart energy.\nThe energy system is also facing various challenges like stability,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, cost control, operational\nefﬁciency, environmental issue,\
    \ service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart energy management big data\
    \ an-\nalytics provide new opportunities to deal with these challenges [18]. The\
    \ innovative storage solution and distributed\nresources for efﬁcient power transmission,\
    \ clean power generation, dynamic power distribution, and rational elec-\ntricity\
    \ consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves the energy transmission\
    \ and data collection at\nthe same time by integrating energy and information\
    \ ﬂow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity\n260\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nsectors like cooling,\
    \ heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building etc. It also provides\
    \ affordable, achievable\nsolutions for sustainable and renewable energy [168].\
    \ In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry,\nenergy consumption\
    \ has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence of\
    \ ICT, the energy\nsystems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated\
    \ data from energy-related sources needs to be\nwell structured for efﬁcient and\
    \ fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption\n\
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its\
    \ developing stage and has brought\nchallenges like energy security and the adoption\
    \ of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third\nof the\
    \ total electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and\
    \ mining. So in order to gather\nvaluable information, they have collected a big\
    \ database. This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231].\nThe\
    \ variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of electricity,\
    \ and interaction with the user, is\nbeing collected by the smart grid. To process\
    \ this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],\nclustering\
    \ [232], classiﬁcation [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied. So, the accurate\
    \ prediction of electricity\ndemand and consumption, the operation and generation\
    \ of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively\ndevelop the pricing\
    \ mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives more control\
    \ over the use\nof energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable energy,\
    \ responds quickly to the demand for electricity,\nand also quickly restores and\
    \ detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking\
    \ decision\nfor customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid\
    \ [308]. Energy management uses emerging\ntechnologies like ICT (Fig. 22).\nFig.\
    \ 22. Energy management (energy cloud) [197].\nThe pattern of consumption and\
    \ production of energy is changed due to involving of big data. The energy big\n\
    data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value, velocity, volume,\
    \ and variety [308].\n7.5.1. Challenges in smart energy\nThere are various opportunities\
    \ and some challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here:\n\
    Effectively collection of energy big data: It is very difﬁcult to collect data\
    \ from energy resources for giving\nefﬁcient and effective decision-making and\
    \ quick responses.\nManagement storage of energy big data: This is also one of\
    \ the major challenges for energy big data to provide\nbetter services to customers.\n\
    M. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n261\nMining\
    \ and analyzing of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data\
    \ and analysis is a very\ntough job.\nLack of effective and efﬁcient decision\
    \ making: The decision making is one of the impotent key points of a smart\nenergy\
    \ system, it also needs to be improved by joining efﬁcient techniques like PDS.\n\
    Privacy preserving of energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving\
    \ security to energy big data.\nWith the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of\
    \ data is ﬂowing without any security measures.\nTo achieve the above-discussed\
    \ challenges efﬁcient and effective tools and techniques like PDS are required.\n\
    7.5.2. Applications of PDS in smart energy\nPrivacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed\
    \ a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and\nLossy Networks)\
    \ to defend from Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole\
    \ attack. Cuckoo-\nRPL is also useful to defend from other attacks like version\
    \ number and gray hole attack [303].\nNetwork trafﬁc management: Chaudhary et\
    \ al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based secure communi-\ncation protocol”\
    \ in the Smart Grid environment for their entity communication. They use a cuckoo\
    \ ﬁlter for fast\nforwarding of data [56].\nLoad Balancing: Debnath et al. present\
    \ a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for ﬂash storage device. This scheme also\nachieved\
    \ the load balancing of elements across the BF component. This scheme proves that\
    \ the BF is useful in load\nbalancing techniques [72].\n7.6. Smart governance\n\
    Smart governance means accessing the government services free and in a better\
    \ manner using various free data\nprojects. With the emergence of ICT in smart\
    \ cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by the\ncities [159].\
    \ Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies can play an important\
    \ role in providing a\ncollaborative platform. A smart economy also emphasizes\
    \ economic competitiveness in the development of the city,\non the competitive\
    \ edge economic and human activity [143].\nSmart Economy: – Smart economy that\
    \ is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-\nefﬁcient,\
    \ is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality\
    \ of life by adopting new inno-\nvative ideas and building new entrepreneurs,\
    \ and start-ups, which increase competitiveness and productivity [263].\nThis\
    \ whole system is based on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic\
    \ advancement. For social\nbeneﬁts smart economy is also expected to deliver more\
    \ products and services without compromising energy and\npollution [144].\nSmart\
    \ Government: – Smart government is the timely demand of the 21st century and\
    \ smart governance is its\nkey tool. The key pillar of smart governance is to\
    \ use technology. The public administration is required to update\nitself with\
    \ the emergence of technology. No one can oppose adopting smart governance as\
    \ it is the new face of\npublic administration, governance, and political process\
    \ [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in\nthe administration\
    \ system and political system and it is the starting face of smart government.\
    \ There is a trend of\nusing modern technologies in public administration for\
    \ smart governance systems by developed countries and their\nresearchers, academicians,\
    \ politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented\
    \ in Fig. 23.\nAn intelligent network is created in the sector of governance and\
    \ it is directly related to the internet where people\ncan connect with each other\
    \ for communication even in remote areas. Better communication with real-time\
    \ objects in\nthe intelligent network is done through the distributed network\
    \ [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so\nit is not artiﬁcial intelligence.\
    \ It only connects to the people for gathering information and making the decision\
    \ and\nuse it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and digital\
    \ applications, a lot of data is produced. The\nsource of big data is social networking\
    \ websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various private and\ngovernment\
    \ websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.\nBig data plays\
    \ an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart governance.\
    \ Researchers,\nacademicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation\
    \ of traditional public administration to modern and\nsmart administration in\
    \ point of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector\
    \ a large\namount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models\
    \ [238]. Big data also help in effective decisions,\nfast and efﬁcient results,\
    \ and expert users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also\
    \ helps in solving\n262\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\nFig. 23. Role of smart government.\ncomplex tools for reforming\
    \ the government but some researchers have doubts about future technologies. Many\n\
    countries have adopted big data for smart governance, but some public administrations\
    \ are still not ready to adopt\nbig data as full ﬂedge. It happens because, for\
    \ implementation of these technologies, data collection, production and\nprocessing\
    \ require a big investment. And those public administrations who implement impulsive\
    \ faces threats and\nchallenges like reducing the productivity, efﬁciency, and\
    \ capacity in governing system [248].\nThe solutions to these challenges, problems,\
    \ and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The\ngovernment\
    \ agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,\
    \ with the help of\nproper use of big data. The government is generating and managing\
    \ the knowledge with their major responsibility\n[5].\n7.6.1. Challenges in smart\
    \ governance\nAdopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already\
    \ adopting big data technologies in smart\ngovernance. But many are facing problems,\
    \ due to their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-\neffectiveness,\
    \ and data available being either unstructured or semi-structured.\nData Privacy:\
    \ Much conﬁdential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration.\
    \ So, it needs to be\nprotected from malicious users.\nApplications of PDS in\
    \ Smart Governance: As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart\
    \ gover-\nnance. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS\
    \ is an efﬁcient data structure for managing\ndata storage and is also compatible\
    \ with new technologies. PDS also helps in protecting data.\n7.7. Smart society\n\
    A smart society means to promote the satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and\
    \ the well-being of metropolitan\nresidents. In this reference, a smart society\
    \ includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure, education,\nliving;\
    \ water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society 4.0 faces the\
    \ challenge with information\nsharing and related knowledge, while in society\
    \ 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due\nto the\
    \ massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.\
    \ The major challenge\nwith big data is to take real-time decisions [94].\nM.\
    \ Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n263\nFig.\
    \ 24. Society evolution 1.0–5.0 [95].\n7.7.1. Society evolution\nSociety is coexistence\
    \ with nature, and according to ethnographers, society 1.0 had begun with the\
    \ birth of humans\nknown as the hunting society (Society 1.0). In 13,000 BC the\
    \ settlements had been ﬁrmly established and irrigation\ntechniques had been developed\
    \ known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the end of the 18th century,\
    \ the steam\nlocomotives were invented and mass production had started, it was\
    \ the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter\n20th century computers\
    \ were invented and the distribution of information was started, this is the information\
    \ society\n(Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century, “super-smart society”\
    \ has introduced and known as (Society\n5.0). The social evolution has categorized\
    \ and concise as given below (Fig. 24).\nSociety 1.0: – This society’s evolution\
    \ begins with the birth of humans. This society is also called a hunting\nsociety.\
    \ People used simple tools for full ﬁll their daily needs including food. People\
    \ have changed their habits on\nthe availability of resources [138].\nSociety\
    \ 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social evolution was introduced with new developing\
    \ agriculture techniques\nand it is also known as an agrarian society. With the\
    \ advancement of technology and demographical changes, this\nrevolution is transformed\
    \ from the earlier society revolution [29]. In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery\
    \ and the\ncultivation of barley and wheat were found at early stages [14].\n\
    Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin at the end of the 18th century,\
    \ when modern physics, gravity law, and\nthe invention of the steam engine had\
    \ discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society changes the face\n\
    of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions are one of the\
    \ growing ﬁelds in terms of economy\nas well as academia [254]. This also builds\
    \ the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and many\nmore.\n\
    Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in 1972 in Japan.\
    \ This society aims for a new\nera after the post-industrial revolution in the\
    \ year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human\ncreativity,\
    \ and the transition, and development of society.\nSociety 5.0: – At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-\n\
    smart society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through\
    \ technologies because it is human-\ncentered. This also improves the quality\
    \ of life, the use of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly\n[14].\n\
    7.7.2. Applications of smart society\nThe smart society is directly concerned\
    \ with citizens and daily lives. The main applications are discussed below\n(Fig.\
    \ 25).\nSmart Home/Houses: – To increase the quality of life and independence,\
    \ the homes are equipped with technolo-\ngies called “smart home” [73]. Smart\
    \ homes include home appliances like television, air conditioners, smart fans\n\
    264\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 25. Applications of smart society.\nand lights, etc. are connected with IoT\
    \ devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing\n\
    the services efﬁciently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent\
    \ role to make decisions [181].\nReducing environmental emissions, energy management,\
    \ and increasing home automation is the primary objective\nof smart home [229].\n\
    Smart Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase\
    \ their standard of living. It\nneeds to follow an inclusive strategic approach\
    \ across all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions\nthat are\
    \ controllable, productive, sustainable, economical, and efﬁcient. Smart living\
    \ is changing people’s lives\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al.\
    \ propose an architecture that controls home lighting using a\nBluetooth-based\
    \ Android smartphone [295]. Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to\
    \ face any problem, they\ncall independently also the objective of smart living\
    \ [153].\nSmart Buildings: – Smart building is deﬁned as it is efﬁcient energy\
    \ management, a convenient and comfort-\nable environment with reasonable investment,\
    \ and is designed to provide service and management [169]. A smart\nbuilding also\
    \ includes automated processes like security, heating, lighting, air conditioning,\
    \ ventilation, and many\nmore [221]. To develop the smart building the things\
    \ required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team, and robust\nwireless infrastructure.\
    \ The basic components of smart building for security includes CCTV system, access\
    \ control,\nintrusion system, gate automation etc [184].\nSmart Education: – With\
    \ the advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented\
    \ with\nAI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs\
    \ attention from both researchers and\nacademics [135]. Various smart education\
    \ projects [121] have already been performed in recent years, in which the\nﬁrst\
    \ smart education project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education\
    \ [62] faces certain issues like\naccessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral\
    \ patterns of a student, data integration, data mining, detecting\neffective and\
    \ emotional state of the student, and many more [60].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh /\
    \ Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n265\n7.7.3. Challenges in smart\
    \ society\nEfﬁciency: – All resource uses in a smart society have their limits\
    \ like battery power, memory storage, and\nbandwidth required for communication.\
    \ They directly affect efﬁciency, which also increases with the rapid growth\n\
    in data.\nHeterogeneous data: – The data generated in the super-smart city is\
    \ heterogeneous, which leads to challenges in\nprocessing, analyzing, and mining\
    \ data. Getting adequate information from big data in heterogeneous information\n\
    networks is also a big challenge.\nPrivacy preserving: – On increasing of smart\
    \ technologies in a smart society the issue of security, and privacy is\nthe main\
    \ concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control, authentication, policy\
    \ enforcement etc.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Society: As such we have not\
    \ found any existing use of PDS in the smart society.\nSo here the scope of use\
    \ of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges, there are many\
    \ studies\nand researches available that PDS and its variants give an efﬁcient\
    \ result with memory management, and storage,\nalso to handle heterogeneous data.\
    \ PDSs also provide security to the data.\n7.8. Smart sustainability\nThe idea\
    \ of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability deﬁne that the to meet\
    \ today’s needs without\nsacriﬁcing the future ability to fulﬁll their requirements\
    \ like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging\ntechnologies and digital\
    \ governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance\
    \ between\nthe technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The\
    \ main pillars of sustainability are environ-\nmental, economic, and social. Smart\
    \ sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].\n\
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable\
    \ development’s planning and\nimplementation, the stakeholder and policymakers\
    \ lack practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technolo-\ngies like\
    \ ICT, IoT and cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity\
    \ are being focused\non the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability\
    \ cities depending on the data-driven identiﬁcation\nof the dynamic changes in\
    \ the broadcast relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability\
    \ the data\ncame from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured.\
    \ The IoT technologies measures in smart\nsustainable cities are air and water\
    \ quality, green urban areas, tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation,\
    \ le-\ngality, and security (Fig. 26). Sustainable economic advancement includes\
    \ all the factors that are included in a smart\ncity. These factors are green\
    \ building, smart education, social responsibility, water management, sustainable\
    \ energy,\nsmart health, smart governance, natural resource management, sustainable\
    \ transportation, and waste management\n(Fig. 27).\nFig. 26. Smart sustainable.\n\
    7.8.1. Challenges in smart sustainability\nCollection of data: – For developing\
    \ sustainability a huge amount of big data is required at a place.\nStorage management:\
    \ – The management of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge.\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: – Security and privacy of this data is also the main concern.\n\
    266\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 27. Smart sustainable city.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Sustainability: As\
    \ such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city\nsustainability.\
    \ So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS and its variant\
    \ are very much\neffective in data collection with less time and efﬁcient storage\
    \ management. It also provides security to the data\nmovement in smart sustainability.\n\
    8. Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city\nIn the smart city, the data, and\
    \ information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive beneﬁts. Today,\n\
    billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of data via the internet,\
    \ and social networks. This\ngrowth in data required efﬁcient storage and handling\
    \ of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96].\nTo improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly or annual data\
    \ production from various\ncompanies, hospitals, institutions, and forests is\
    \ at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are\nimportant\
    \ for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized\
    \ data structure given by Burton\nBloom, for efﬁciently storing information of\
    \ static sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely\nused\
    \ in many networking and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing\
    \ uses of PDS in smart cities, it is\nfound that many researchers have used BF\
    \ in healthcare for efﬁcient storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc.\n\
    in various applications Some of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city\
    \ are recapitulated in below (Table 6).\n9. Generational data management\nA massive\
    \ amount of data is ﬂowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs to be managed\
    \ for their well-being\nto be used for both personal and civic data services.\

    \ – May be applicable in smart city applications.\nIslam et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ mechanism using bloom ﬁlter which provides protection from cyber threats\nin\
    \ the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ distributed data storage\nscheme with enabled edge computing. The counting bloom\
    \ ﬁlter is used when the storage checking fails to locate\nthe error data and\
    \ to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al. propose a secure and privacy-preserving\n\
    blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. For secure proﬁle matching, the ‘Key-policy\
    \ attribute-based encryption’\nalgorithm is used, and to verify the authenticity\
    \ of ciphertext, a bloom ﬁlter with hash functions is designed [200].\nA secure\
    \ framework in a sustainable city environment is proposed by Singh et al. for\
    \ smart parking that is energy\nefﬁcient and blockchain-enabled. For secure communication\
    \ of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n(ECC) algorithm is used\
    \ at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data [247].\n10. Research\
    \ opportunities and challenges in smart city\nAs discussed in Section 1.1, big\
    \ data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance from the\n\
    perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured\
    \ data, especially when responses\nare required in real-time, remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the\nidentiﬁed\
    \ research areas are:\nFiltering and processing of sensor data: – The data generated\
    \ by various sensors and wearable devices have\nsome limitations like security,\
    \ privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns. Also,\
    \ have\nincompatibility issues between data and information. The information collected\
    \ by these devices may contain some\nnoise. This sensor data may be also corrupted\
    \ by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue\
    \ needs to be addressed.\nDifﬁcult to monitoring user’s social networking data:\
    \ – It is difﬁcult to monitor users’ data on social network-\ning sites. In smart\
    \ healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system\
    \ for detecting the\npsychological disturbance in patients is presented named\
    \ emotional healthcare. Some techniques used to detect de-\npressive and stressful\
    \ content are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\
    \ and\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation\
    \ systems for patients to get a\ntext-based on the results while they had been\
    \ monitored.\nLack of efﬁcient computational models and data structures: – The\
    \ expansion of massive data has generated\nlarge and complicated data sets. Traditional\
    \ methods used for storage and retrieval of data, increase the computation\noverhead\
    \ in big processing and hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users.\
    \ For big data handling some\nadvanced data, models are required which produce\
    \ results in minimum time with minimum computation overhead.\nOne of the basic\
    \ problems of massive data is to style efﬁcient computational models and data\
    \ structures for solving\nthese problems in big data.\nThe need for energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data processing: – The rise of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for\
    \ a\nsmart city. Energy management has become a major issue resource as IoT devices\
    \ are constantly consuming huge\namounts of energy. These concerns must be considered\
    \ in order to establish an effective mechanism. The efﬁcient use\n272\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nof power aims to\
    \ promise a sustainable city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount\
    \ of data which is needed\nfor optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge\
    \ in securing smart cities is the sharing of data and access control.\nData storage\
    \ and processing: – Smart Cities take hold of the relative advantage of being\
    \ robust for storing\ndata and processing it in the information world. The applications\
    \ of smart cities have generated a continuous huge\namount of data from different\
    \ sources. The existing traditional methods are insufﬁcient to manage this volume\n\
    of data and they have restricted processing speed and effective storage expansion\
    \ costs. To overcome this issue,\nefﬁcient computational models and data structures\
    \ are required.\nVolume data: – Although it is difﬁcult to quantify this challenge\
    \ because data sets are typically very big like hun-\ndreds of terabytes or more.\
    \ The traditional storage system like Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\
    and new big data technologies like Hadoop are developed to efﬁciently count the\
    \ data that must be kept and pro-\ncessed. The new data structures are also required\
    \ to handle and produce results at run time.\nReal time response: – The Response\
    \ Time (RT) in the smart city is very important in term of service, results, data\n\
    transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact that the data transmission and business\
    \ data infrastructure at elevated cost\nand should be considered with fewer delays.\
    \ In this case, various techniques have been used which are depending\non the\
    \ situation and difﬁculty of analysis. In smart cities where responses need to\
    \ be given after processing huge\ndata or by handling streaming data, then traditional\
    \ techniques and approaches are not efﬁcient. So some new data\nhandling techniques/data\
    \ structures are required to provide results in real-time.\nVariety of Data: –\
    \ In the smart city the source of a variety of data is also a major issue. The\
    \ smart city data\nis available in different data sets for different applications\
    \ of smart city and with different format styles like audio,\nvideo, images, text\
    \ etc. The data collected from a variety of sources are ambiguous, unstructured,\
    \ or semi-structured.\nThis data needs to be in a well-structured manner for effective\
    \ and efﬁcient results. The traditional methods are not\nsufﬁcient or even do\
    \ not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data management,\
    \ a new data\nstructure like PDS is required.\nSearching and Retrieving for a\
    \ data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efﬁciently searching\n\
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,\
    \ in a variety of formats, is a major\nchallenge. In some applications when deadlines\
    \ are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious.\nStream Processing(Data\
    \ Collection and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart\
    \ cities is a\nbig challenge. There is a huge amount of data is ﬂow in the smart\
    \ city. The processing and analysis of this set of\ndata are required. When raw\
    \ data is combined like vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media,\
    \ weather\ndata, then the streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long\
    \ time in result, access problem etc. Also\nsome problems in development like\
    \ it is still dependent. Various decisions and predictions are based on this type\
    \ of\ndata like trafﬁc, future power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems\
    \ are proposed but with various limitations.\nA new mechanism is required to design\
    \ for efﬁcient and effective results.\nIntegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources\
    \ (Diversity Consolidation): – The data coming from different sources\nis not\
    \ in proper sequence, maybe in a different format, or ambiguous. The operation\
    \ on these data sets is difﬁcult to\napply like validation, authentication, updating,\
    \ alteration etc. This data is need to be well structured and organized.\nNatural\
    \ Text Analysis and Communication(social media analysis): – The analysis of natural\
    \ text from social\nnetworks is available through mobile devices like smartphones\
    \ is also challenging. This data is used for monitoring\nthe behavior and emotions\
    \ of citizens in real life. The information on location from various social networking\
    \ sites is\nnot in a proper format. The data include the comments and statements\
    \ about the user’s feelings, thoughts, interests,\nrelations etc. are integrated\
    \ with sensor data. The reliability of this data is also a big challenge.\nAmbient\
    \ Intelligence issues/challenges (speciﬁc to the current generation of smart city\
    \ domains): – The ex-\npeditious growth of conversion from rural to urban areas\
    \ and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly. It also\nincreases the usage\
    \ and deployment of smart technologies in everything and everywhere in the city.\
    \ So, smart cities\nmay also face some ambient intelligence issues. The main concern\
    \ in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine\nwith automation and autonomous\
    \ system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs like:\nHuman control\
    \ vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or fooled by scam stickers\
    \ on road by\nautonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving (Uber) had met a\
    \ deadly accident with a woman walking at night\n[185]. Hard Behavior is also\
    \ one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations\
    \ of\ncustomers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without\
    \ the involvement of humans. In AI-based\nbehavior, there are missing traceability,\
    \ transparency, and incomprehensible decisions.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n273\nPrivacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off\
    \ between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data\nshould be\
    \ provided to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.\n\
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used\
    \ for analyzing and gathering in-\nformation. These sensors generally collect\
    \ the data like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these\n\
    types of sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224].\n\
    Hackers vs Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses\
    \ of sensors and IoT technology\nhave expanded.\nBeing Socially Inclusive: The\
    \ programs like ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for\
    \ real-time\nupdates. This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart\
    \ cities can’t afford to take transit, all elderly\ngrowing people do use smart\
    \ mobile devices or apps, and how it is possible to use and reach technology to\
    \ these\ngroups of people?\n11. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper, we have\
    \ discussed the role of big data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance\
    \ of big\ndata in smart cities. In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have\
    \ been discussed. There are various architectures\nthat have been discussed by\
    \ many researchers, but the most appropriate architecture for the smart city is\
    \ elaborated\nin Section 4. Los Angeles took the ﬁrst action or made the ﬁrst\
    \ contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They\nanalyze the urban big data.\
    \ In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also future plans regarding\
    \ smart cities.\nThe role of big data in smart cities is crucial in a smart city.\
    \ Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed\n(Section 6) as a key\
    \ solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes the\
    \ various applications\nof smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,\
    \ smart environment, agriculture, smart governance\nand economy, smart society,\
    \ people, education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found,\
    \ after going\nthrough various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities;\
    \ that there is an inﬂuence of big data in a smart\ncity. Generated data is inconsistent,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured, lack of efﬁciency in retrieval and storage\n\
    management of data, privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city,\
    \ the collection of data itself is a big\nchallenge. The data collected using\
    \ IoT devices, records (medical history), social media, and web pages are too\
    \ large.\nObviously, this data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring\
    \ systems in smart cities also have issues in the\nanalysis and representation\
    \ of this big data with low dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere\
    \ endeavors\ninto extracting information from a huge amount of knowledge databases.\
    \ The main challenge in this effort is that\nthere is no standard approach to\
    \ efﬁciently map and keep the big data on consistent data structures. The existing\n\
    tool and techniques cannot work efﬁciently and satisfactorily in data management.\
    \ To store and processing of data\nfor optimal recovery and exploring procedures,\
    \ data structures like PDS is one of the adequate standards to use. In\nthe conclusion\
    \ of this paper after reviewing related work, we have listed the exiting and scope\
    \ of PDS in various\napplications of smart cities in Table 7.\nTable 7\nDomain\

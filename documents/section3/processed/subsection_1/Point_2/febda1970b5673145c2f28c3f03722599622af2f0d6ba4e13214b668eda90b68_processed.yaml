    Progress in Precision Agriculture ((PRPRA)) Abstract Wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) are a group of interconnected autonomous sensor nodes that use wireless
    communication technology. Their goal is to monitor physical or environmental conditions
    and to transmit their data cooperatively to a base station. The WSNs are used
    widely and have proved particularly useful in difficult environments where wired
    networks cannot be deployed. This feature together with their ability to adapt
    to changing environments, and the low cost of installing and maintaining them
    are the main characteristics that make them good sources of data in agricultural
    settings. The use of WSNs can provide farmers with valuable information on field
    properties, which can help them understand field variability and make better and
    quicker decisions on applying agricultural inputs such as pesticides, irrigation
    and fertilizers. Information on WSNs presented in this chapter is designed to
    provide potential users with the main concepts of WSNs and the ability to select
    the best WSN properly for their needs. The chapter is divided into three sections:
    (5.1) Concepts of Sensing with WSNs; (5.2) Applications of WSNs in Agriculture
    and (5.3) Conclusions and Future of WSNs. Section 5.1 presents the importance
    of WSNs. Most of the available wireless communication standards and protocols
    are described and their performance is compared. Section 5.2 presents the sensors
    and electronics that are available in the market. Furthermore, it describes and
    presents examples of applications of WSNs in agriculture such as irrigation, fertilizer
    application, pest management, crop and weather monitoring. Section 5.3 discusses
    the importance of WSNs for agricultural applications. Use of WSNs will improve
    overall agricultural system performance and will propel us closer to precision
    agriculture and smart farming, by providing the data that will allow farmers to
    apply the right amount of resources at the right time and in the right place.
    Future improvements to WSNs will make them more efficient, less complex and self-healing.

    with Wireless Sensor Networks 5.1.1 Introduction Rapidly increasing technological
    developments have resulted in communication technology, nanotechnology and small
    microchips. Each of these developments has contributed to the establishment and
    use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and smart sensors that are used in a variety
    of applications. A complete WSN in its simplest form consists of a sensor network
    made up of sensor nodes to record at least one property and a central gateway
    known as the base station that collects data from the sensor network. Data transfer
    among sensor nodes of the same network and between the sensor network and the
    base station requires the utilization of communication protocols. A sensor node,
    sometimes referred to as a mote , consists of three main components: the electronics,
    the sensor(s) and the antenna. The electronics are small-embedded computers that
    are responsible for collecting data from sensors, communicating with other sensor
    nodes and performing some processing, e.g. calibration of sensor readings based
    on ambient temperature. Sensor response is typically in the form of an electrical
    property such as voltage, current, or resistance and mathematical formulae are
    applied to transform the raw data to a measurement unit associated with the property
    being measured by the sensor. Hence, smart nodes are equipped with embedded computers
    that run software, which converts the output of the sensors into physical units.
    For example, some soil moisture sensors respond to changing soil moisture conditions
    by physically measuring the resistance between two conductors. The change in resistance
    is measured by the change in the excitation signal which the node captures, compensates
    for temperature using software and transforms to a measurement in terms of matric
    potential in units of kPa. In addition, embedded computers run software to establish
    communication among sensor nodes and the base station. Each sensor node has an
    antenna to ensure proper connectivity with other sensor nodes and or the base
    station within the WSNs . Even though WSNs use embedded computers to accomplish
    their tasks, the architecture of the network is different from that of other computer
    networks. A network makes information and services available to anyone on the
    network regardless of their location. There are many network types such as wide
    area networks (WAN), local area networks (LAN), personal area networks (PAN) and
    metropolitan area networks (MAN). The main difference between these types of networks
    is the arrangement of the elements of the communication network or the topologies
    and the protocols they use. 5.1.2 Principles of Wireless Sensor Networks in Agriculture
    Sensor networks were initially developed some decades ago to monitor information
    and control systems. Their initial design included hard-wired sensors and a central
    computer connected through a data bus network (Fig. 5.1). However, the installation
    cost of hard-wired sensors is large because of the labor, cables, testing and
    maintenance. In addition, with time wired sensor networks have proved to be unreliable
    because connectors can become loose, break or are misconnected. These problems
    are more frequent when sensor networks are installed outdoors. For example, it
    is cumbersome to use hard-wired sensors in a field for crop monitoring because
    either regular field activities are impeded by the cables or the cables are damaged
    by the activities. The WSNs eliminate many of these problems. They enable connectivity
    of sensors without the need for wires (Gutierrez et al. 2004). This means that
    this type of network collects data from wireless sensors and sends data to a terminal.
    The terminal of a WSN can have several forms. For example, it can be an actuator
    to control a system, a screen to present the information or even a server to store
    and manipulate the information. Furthermore, the development of micro electro
    mechanical systems (MEMS) and integrated circuits (IC) contributed to the development
    of sensor nodes (Schurgers and Srivastava, 2001). Sensor nodes can utilize wireless
    communication, read sensors and process the sensor readings at the same time because
    they use a processor. Additionally, sensor nodes are small, low-cost and require
    a small amount of power for their operation. More advantages and disadvantages
    of wireless networks are presented in Table 5.1. These characteristics make them
    ideal for outdoor use compared to hard-wired sensors. A WSN consists of many sensor
    nodes that can record pressure, humidity, soil properties, temperature, noise
    and many other variables. Fig. 5.1 Schematic diagram of a bus network Full size
    image Table 5.1 Advantages and disadvantages of wireless and wired networks Full
    size table 5.1.2.1 Wireless Communication Standards and Protocols Sensor nodes
    within a WSN exchange data with each other and with other devices such as data
    loggers and laptop computers. However, WSNs when developed must be based on standards
    to ensure communication among devices and other nodes. These standards are categorized
    into four types based on their specific application and transmission range. They
    are: The IEEE 802.15 standard that is used for wireless personal area networks
    (WPAN; Valentini et al. 2010; Mansourkiaie and Ahmed 2016, Luo et al. 2015); the
    IEEE 802.11 standard that is used for wireless local area networks (WLAN; Lin
    et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2015; Meng et al. 2016, Gupta et al. 2015); the IEEE
    802.16 standard, known as worldwide interoperability for microwave access networks
    (WiMAX) and also known as the wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN; Akashdeep
    et al., 2014); and the IEEE 802.20 standard that is used for wireless wide area
    networks (WWAN; Zou et al., 2004). Table 5.2 presents the differences in the four
    wireless communication standards. Communication protocols are formal descriptions
    of digital message formats and rules and can include information about authentication,
    signaling, error detection and correction. In addition, they can describe the
    syntax and synchronization of analogue and digital communications. There are currently
    nine wireless communication protocols used for WSNs (Table 5.3). The reason why
    so many are used is that each WSN application requires a specific combination
    of data rate, frequency, power consumption and reception range. It is very common
    in agriculture to use the IEEE 802.15 standard with the IEEE.802.15.4/ZigBee protocol
    because the power requirements are low, the range of distance for transmitting
    data is acceptable for agricultural applications and the cost is small. The IEEE.802.15.4
    was developed in 2003 for low-power wireless personal area networks (LP-WPAN)
    to overcome problems related to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth such as power consumption
    and reception range. Based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, it supports two categories
    of devices. The first is called a reduced function device (RFD) that is responsible
    for executing simple tasks. This type of device is not standalone, which means
    that they cannot be used to manage a network. They usually implement a sensing
    task (e.g. read sensors), report the sensor readings and go to sleep mode to save
    power. However, RFDs cannot exchange data with other RFDs but they can ‘talk’
    to full-function devices (FFD ). The FFDs are the second type of device mentioned
    above and are responsible for tasks that are more complicated. They can run software
    and also manage networks. Most common devices for outdoor applications are RFDs
    because they require simple programming code and they are able to set themselves
    into sleep mode for a certain period to save power before waking up again for
    the next round of sensing. Table 5.2 Main characteristics of wireless communication
    standards Full size table Table 5.3 Advantages and disadvantages of wireless communication
    protocols Full size table The use of the internet of things (IoT) in agriculture
    increased users’ demand for wireless networks that have large coverage, large
    scale deployment and require low power. To meet these needs, the long range wide
    area network (LoRaWAN) standard (commonly abbreviated as LoRa) was developed by
    the LoRaWAN Alliance. It is used for bi-directional communication on wireless
    sensor networks. The range of the transmitted data rates varies from 0.3 to 50
    kbps and depends on the spreading factor (SF) and the adaptive data rate (ADR)
    algorithm. The aim of the ADR is to select the ideal SF to reduce power consumption
    and optimize the bandwidth. The LoRa also uses a network server, which manages
    the communication of nodes and gateways and defines their SF . Nodes transmit
    data to more than one gateway and then the gateways transmit them to a network
    server. The network server transmits the data continuously to a specific application
    server. Communications between nodes and gateways are established in LoRa while
    communications between gateways and network servers utilize internet protocol
    (IP) such as WiFi or 5G. The main disadvantages of LoRa are the large number of
    rejected packet rates (RPR) and the large packet error rates (PER). The RPR is
    the number of data packages that arrive at the gateway with power that is less
    than the defined threshold and are considered lost, whereas PER expresses the
    number of data packages with binary error that are received from the gateway.
    An improved version of LoRa was proposed by Mroue et al. (2020). 5.1.2.2 Network
    Topologies in WSNs The topology of a network system is divided into two categories:
    the physical and the logical. The physical network topology describes how the
    elements of a network system are connected physically to each other such as wires,
    wireless connection and much more. On the other hand, the logical network defines
    the relation among the elements that are included in a network and explains how
    data are transferred in a network. Network topologies play a crucial role in network
    performance and functionality and they help with errors and faults in the network
    systems. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is widely used in agricultural applications,
    supports almost all topologies such as star (Fig. 5.2), mesh (Fig. 5.3), tree
    (Fig. 5.4) and cluster tree networks (Fig. 5.5). These topologies are also used
    by other networks and they have their advantages and disadvantages as described
    in Table 5.4. Fig. 5.2 Schematic diagrams of star topologies: (a) a typical star
    topology (b) an example of star topology used by LoRa Full size image Fig. 5.3

    a tree network. Reduced function devices (RFDs) devices cannot exchange data with
    other RFD devices, but they can ‘talk’ to full function devices (FFDs) Full size
    image Fig. 5.5 Schematic diagram of cluster tree network Full size image Table
    5.4 Advantages and disadvantages of the topologies of WSNs Full size table In
    a sensor network that uses a star topology, every node is connected directly to
    a central computer or a central node that controls the network (base station)
    and is indirectly connected with other nodes through the central node. The benefits
    of the star topology are that it allows the whole network system to work properly
    even if there are failures of one or more nodes. It is easy to set up a network
    system using star topology and it is simple to add and remove nodes from the network.
    A disadvantage of the star topology is that sensor network performance depends
    on the central computer (base station) and if it fails, the whole network will
    be down and will not record data. Another disadvantage, is that this topology
    typically requires line-of-sight between a sensor node and the base station. In
    contrast, in sensor networks that use mesh topology, every node communicates with
    other nodes in the same network. In other words, it is considered a point-to-point
    connection where nodes are interconnected (Fig. 5.3). This topology is often used
    in agriculture, especially when the distance between nodes is large. In this topology
    data are transmitted by the routing and flooding methods. The routing method uses
    the logical route that is the shortest distance between the nodes and the central
    computer or base station, whereas in the flooding method data are sent to every
    node that belongs to the same network. The advantage of mesh topology is that
    line-of-sight is not required between all sensor nodes and the base station. Data
    are transmitted to the base station if at least one node has line-of-sight to
    the base station. Another advantage is that mesh topology is self-healing. In
    other words, if one path of transmission is disrupted because of failure of a
    sensor node, the mesh is re-established using different pathways. However, network
    systems with mesh topology are complex and require extensive configuration. Another
    form of topology is the tree network (Fig. 5.4). The name comes from the shape
    of the layout which looks like a tree with many branches. The main characteristic
    of this topology is the hierarchical relationship between the main node (or root
    node) and the other nodes of the network while there is only one mutual connection
    between two nodes. The tree topology is ideal for sensor networks where the nodes
    are located far from each other such as in WANs. This type of topology allows
    users to add or remove nodes from the system and enables them to find and fix
    errors in the network. On the other hand, the tree topology has many reliability
    issues because if the root node fails the whole system fails. It is also difficult
    to control sensor networks with tree topology that consists of many nodes. To
    solve this problem, cluster tree topology is used. The latter is similar to tree
    topology, but the root node can be connected with many clusters of nodes (Fig.
    5.5). Unlike the IEEE.802.15.4 protocol, the IEEE.802.15.4/ZigBee supports only
    the star, tree and mesh topologies. 5.2 Applications of WSNs in Agriculture Economic
    pressures for achieving greater production efficiencies in agriculture coupled
    with global needs for more food production have increased the use of sensors on
    farms. Tables 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 give examples of the sensors used for agricultural
    purposes. They are used for sensing weather, soil and plant properties, respectively.
    Some of these sensors measure two or more properties and can be incorporated into
    WSNs . Table 5.5 Weather sensors used in agriculture Full size table Table 5.6

    they produce the required measurements and data, the critical component of a WSN
    is the micro-controller unit that reads sensor values and translates them into
    a physical unit. In many agricultural applications, these circuit boards are responsible
    for the network communication and data transfer. Table 5.8 presents some commercial
    circuit boards or motes and their features. 5.3 WSNs for Application of Inputs
    5.3.1 Irrigation Applications Farming is the dominant consumer of freshwater,
    consuming 70% the world’s fresh water withdrawals (Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations 2020). Agricultural demands on fresh water supplies are
    likely to increase as food production increases to feed growing populations and
    non-farm uses of freshwater continue to grow. During the last decade, groundwater
    supplies have been depleting at an alarming rate in many agriculture areas, while
    increasing amounts of industrial activity also demand huge amounts of fresh water.
    Substantial technological innovation has increased the efficiency of irrigated
    agriculture over the past several decades, but there is considerable potential
    for continued improvement. At least half of the irrigated cropland area across
    the United States is still irrigated with less efficient, traditional irrigation
    application systems. If irrigated agriculture is to survive, new irrigation practices
    and tools should be developed for more efficient water use. The WSNs are one of
    the tools that contribute to irrigation management for improving irrigation efficiency
    worldwide. In Portugal, Morais et al. (1996) used a WSN to record weather data
    such as solar radiation, soil temperature, air temperature and relative humidity
    together with soil moisture data. The network was ideal for low data-rate applications
    and included several solar powered wireless acquisition stations that collected
    the data. The soil moisture sensors used were dual probe type with a heat pulse.
    The network protocol used a combination of time division multiple access (TDMA)
    and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). The TDMA is a technique that is used
    in digital mobile radio systems. It allows several users to share the same frequency
    channel by dividing the timescale into different time slots that are allocated
    periodically to each user. On the other hand, CSMA is a protocol that checks networks
    for any other data transmissions that may be in progress prior to transferring
    data. When data transmission is detected, the network waits for it to end the
    transferring process. The system worked well; however, there were power supply
    problems. In Spain, Damas et al. (2001) developed and evaluated a WSN-based irrigation
    system for pivots and laterals. The network system was based on the M-Bus standard
    which used to be called HidroBus. The M-Bus is a European standard for remote
    reading of water, gas and electricity meters. The WSN is capable of reading meters,
    water pressure, reservoir levels, and controlling solenoid valves and water pumps.
    To evaluate the WSN , an area was divided into seven sub-regions and each sub-region
    was monitored through the WSN . The results showed that utilizing this WSN could
    reduce irrigation use by 30–60%, increase crop productivity and optimize fertilizer
    use. In the USA Evans and Bergman (2003) reported the use of a WSN for irrigation
    scheduling purposes that used soil moisture sensors, on-site weather data and
    grower preferences, whereas Kim et al. (2008) developed a closed-loop irrigation
    system based on a WSN . They used soil water content sensors to monitor soil moisture
    and IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth technology to collect weather information, soil
    moisture data and sprinkler position. The results of the system evaluation showed
    that such a low-cost wireless system could be useful for remote control of irrigation
    in precision agriculture (PA) applications. Similar work was done by Kim and Evans
    (2009) who developed an in-field WSN to implement site-specific sprinkler irrigation
    using Bluetooth wireless communication. Furthermore, they developed wireless in-field
    sensing and control software (WISC) which integrates a variable-rate irrigation
    controller with in-field data feedback. The whole system could be used as a decision
    support tool for irrigation and real-time monitoring of irrigation operations.
    Nam et al. (2016) proposed a WSN for irrigation management that is based on radio
    frequency identification (RFID) and quick response (QR) technologies. Specifically,
    they installed water gauges to measure the water levels of irrigation canals and
    gate regulators to control the water flow of the canals. The WSN was based on
    RFID and QR codes while a database management system was developed to manage the
    agricultural water. The sensor network collected data wirelessly and transmitted
    them to a local server that played the role of a decision support system. The
    transmission of the data between the sensor nodes and the server was based on
    the CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access; for long range communication) and Zigbee
    (for medium-range communication) protocols. The WSNs have also been used to increase
    irrigation water-use efficiency of drip irrigation (Barkunan et al. 2019). Smartphones
    were used to take photographs of soil samples to calculate the degree of wetness
    of the soil. The smartphone transmitted the data to a micro-controller that made
    irrigation decisions. The global system for mobile (GSM) communication protocol
    was used for transferring the data from the smartphone to the microcontroller.
    The University of Georgia Smart Sensor Array (UGA SSA) is a system that records
    soil moisture within fields (Vellidis et al. 2013; Liakos et al. 2017). It consists
    of a monitoring system, a commercial server that receives soil moisture data wirelessly
    and a website that presents soil moisture data and recommends irrigation rates
    (see Figs. 11.3 and 11.4 in Chap. 11). The monitoring system consists of smart
    sensor nodes and a gateway. Each node has a circuit board, a radio frequency (RF)
    transmitter (Fig. 5.6), soil moisture sensors, thermocouple wires and an antenna.
    Each node accommodates two thermocouples for measuring temperature and a probe
    that consists of up to three Watermark® soil moisture sensors (Fig. 5.7b). The
    RF transmitter module (Fig. 5.7; RF220SU, Synapse Wireless, Huntsville, Alabama,
    USA) is a postage stamp-sized intelligent low-cost ($44 in 2020), low-power (2–3.6
    V), 2.4 GHz radio module capable of acquiring, analysing and transmitting sensor
    data up to 2 Mbps. A diode installed close to the antenna plug is used to prevent
    high current such as that resulting from nearby lightning from passing from the
    antenna to the electronics. Fig. 5.6 The front side of the circuit with the radio
    frequency transmitter. SM1, SM2 and SM3 are the positive terminals for reading
    the current of the three soil moisture sensors and GNDs are the negative terminals.
    T1 and T2 are the terminals for connecting the thermocouple wires. The diode is
    installed to prevent high currents passing from the antenna to the electronics.
    This is used for extra protection of the electronics in case of a nearby lightning
    strike. The number on the sticker ‘D60533EB’ is the address of the radio transmitter
    Full size image Fig. 5.7 (a) A UGA SSA node installed in maize (Zea mays L.).
    The electronics are housed in the white PVC container. The Spring allows the antenna
    to bend when farm vehicles pass overhead, (b) The UGA SSA sensor probe integrates
    three Watermark sensors and can be customized to any length, (c) Antennae can
    vary in length to accommodate the crop. For cotton (Gossypium L.), 2.7 m antennae
    are used whereas for maize it is 4.2 m Full size image One characteristic of the
    soil moisture recording system is that it uses a wireless mesh network to communicate
    between irrigation sensor nodes. The RF transmitters act as a repeater to pass
    along data from other nodes to form a meshed network of nodes. If any of the nodes
    in the network stop transmitting or receiving, or if signal pathways become blocked,
    the operating software re-configures signal routes to maintain data acquisition
    from the network. To overcome the attenuating effect of the plant canopy on radio
    transmissions, the RF transmitter antenna is mounted on spring-loaded, hollow,
    6 mm diameter, flexible fiberglass rods approximately 2.5 m above ground level
    (Fig. 5.7a, c). This design allows field equipment such as tractors and sprayers
    to pass over the sensors. The published range of the RF transmitter is 500 m although
    its effective range has been observed to exceed 750 m. The smart sensor boards
    are powered with two 1.5 V alkaline batteries, which last for a growing season
    (>150 days; Fig. 5.8). Lithium batteries are not a good solution for this system
    because several field experiments exposed their vulnerability to low voltage,
    especially below 2 V. Furthermore, to optimize the battery life, the boards are
    programmed to set themselves in a low-current sleep mode when not transmitting
    data. Fig. 5.8 Power consumption graph of one node throughout the growing season
    of 2018 Full size image The potential of the UGA SSA is good because significant
    reductions (up to 50%) in irrigation water and significant increases in irrigation
    water-use efficiency (up to 40%) have been recorded. The UGA SSA was commercialized
    by Advanced Ag Systems (Dothan, Alabama, USA). An irrigation case study of the
    UGA SSA in peanuts is presented as case study 1 in Chap. 11 “Case study from the
    south-eastern USA: Variable-rate irrigation with centre pivot” (Case Study 11.1).
    Specifically, the case study gives a detailed description of how prescription
    maps for irrigation purposes are created and how the UGA SSA web-based user interface
    helps users to make irrigation decisions. Additionally, it presents performance
    data of an on-farm evaluation of the UGA SSA in a peanut field. 5.3.2 Fertilizer
    Applications Fertilizers are used to increase crop yields, but even under the
    best circumstances, their use efficiency does not exceed 50%. The WSNs have been
    used to help crop growers fertilize their fields more efficiently with the main
    aim of increasing crop production while decreasing input costs. An example of
    a WSN for fertilizer purposes was developed by Cugati et al. (2003) who created
    a fertilizer applicator for orchards. The system consisted of input and output
    modules and a decision support tool (DST). The input modules collected GPS data
    and real-time sensor data such as tree canopy size, soil electrical conductivity,
    path planning and weather conditions. The communication between the sensors and
    the input module was based on a Bluetooth connection and the data were imported
    into a geographic information system (GIS). The DST consisted of a mathematical
    model and controllers. The mathematical model was used to estimate optimum fertilizer
    rates based on the data collected and the controllers to control the actuators
    on spreaders (output module). The wireless connection between the DST and the
    actuators was based on the Bluetooth protocol. Another example of a WSN used for
    site-specific fertilizer application was described by Elhert et al. (2004) who
    developed a mechanical sensor that measures crop density. The sensor was mounted
    in front of a tractor with a spreader. A console received sensor data through
    a modified controller area network (CAN) bus connection and calculated the optimal
    amount of fertilizer. The console then controlled the spreader actuators. He et
    al. (2011) developed on ASP.NET platform DST for variable-rate application of
    fertilizers. The system used a LAN type WSN with the IEEE 802.11 protocol to acquire
    environmental data such as soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, temperature,
    pH, air temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and illumination and transmitted
    them to a server to make them available to participating farmers. The fertilizer
    application DST used integrated and optimal fertilization models that utilized
    these variables to recommend optimal fertilizer rates. Furthermore, the server
    used a GIS to interpolate data from small experimental plots and extrapolate them
    to larger plots to reduce the cost of data acquisition. 5.3.3 Pest Management
    Applications Pest management is the process used to solve problems related to
    pests. In agriculture, pest management typically involves the application of pesticides
    to crops either prophylactically or after pests have been detected. Several WSNs
    have been developed to increase pest management efficiency. For example, Baggio
    (2005) developed a WSN to protect potato crops from Phytophthora, a fungal disease
    that causes large economic losses on crops worldwide. The WSN consisted of sensors
    that measured relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture and height of
    the water table. The electronics that read the sensors communicated with each
    other using the time-out medium access control (T-MAC) protocol. This protocol
    allows every node to wake up periodically to communicate with its neighbours,
    and then to sleep again until the next frame. The use of this protocol reduced
    the power consumption of the nodes and the experiments proved that Phytophthora
    was significantly reduced in potatoes after using the WSN . Faical et al. (2014)
    proposed a more complicated pesticide management system integrated with a WSN
    . They used an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a sprayer for pesticide
    applications and installed a WSN on the ground. The WSN consisted of several nodes
    installed at different locations within a field. Each node measured the amount
    of pesticide applied by the UAV . In addition, the authors developed a model that
    estimated the difference between the prescribed pesticide rate and the applied.
    When the difference exceeded a specific threshold, the WSN sent messages to the
    UAV to adjust its route so that each location of the field received the prescribed
    pesticide rate. The communication between each node and the UAV was achieved using
    the Xbee–Pro 2 series that supports the IEEE.802.15.4/ZigBee protocol. 5.4 WSNs
    for Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring plays an important role in PA because monitoring
    different crop properties can lead to improvement in agricultural production.
    Thus, WSNs are often used for crop monitoring. Sanchez et al. (2011) described
    an integrated WSN solution for PA. The WSN used several nodes to record soil salinity,
    pH, soil temperature and soil moisture. A gateway was also installed in each field
    to collect data from each node and send the data to another gateway that was installed
    at a farmers’ cooperative. In addition, a motion detection (PIR, Passive Infrared
    Sensor) and identification (camera) sensors were used for video-surveillance in
    case of an intruder, therefore taking care of both crop security and control functions.
    Data from all sensors were transmitted by the communication modules to a common
    device denoted as the Gateway that was installed in the field. The gateway was
    responsible for delivering the information to a farmers’ cooperative system that
    provided farmers with information about their crops in real time such as sensor
    readings and videos of fields. The communication protocol used for transferring
    the data from fields to the cooperative was the IEEE 802.15.4. Liqiang et al.
    (2011) developed a crop monitoring system using a WSN . The system consisted of
    two platforms. One platform collected meteorological and soil information such
    as temperature, humidity, wind, air, rainfall and soil pH while the second platform
    captured images of the crops to quantify crop growth. The monitoring nodes used
    general packet radio service (GPRS) and code division multiple access (CDMA)  technology
    for wireless communication. Jones et al. (2018) developed a wireless sensor network
    for the study of evapotranspiration in different crops. Infrared temperature sensors
    and dry reference sensors were used to record canopy temperature and estimate
    evapotranspiration of cotton. The nodes transmitted the data to a base station
    located in the field using ultra-high frequency (UHF) radios while the base station
    sent the data to a server using 3G communication. The server then analyzed the
    data and visualized visualized them at an online web portal. Bauer et al. (2019)
    used a WSN to estimate leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat. The network consisted
    of sensors that measured the LAI below and above the canopy. Communication between
    sensors was achieved using the IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee protocol. 5.5 The WSNs for
    Meteorology Weather data are very important for agriculture because crop yields
    are strongly related to environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation
    and evapotranspiration. The University of Georgia Weather Network (http://weather.uga.edu/)
    consists of 87 ground weather stations which are equipped with sensors to monitor
    air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, wind
    direction, soil temperature at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 m depths, atmospheric pressure
    and soil moisture every second. Data are summarized at 15 minutes intervals while
    a daily summary is calculated at midnight. At each site, a microcomputer receives
    data from all sensors and uploads them on a server using a mobile network (GSM
    ). The server stores and analyses the data and delivers them to users. A similar
    automated wireless weather network is operated by the University of Florida (FAWN;
    https://fawn.ifas.ufl.edu/). The FAWN consists of 37 ground weather stations and
    records soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, barometric
    pressure, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction, dew point and evapotranspiration.
    The nodes at each site communicate with the base station using RF technology and
    each base station transmits the data to a server using a cellular modem with 2G
    technology and GPRS network (Table 5.9). Table 5.9 Applications of WSNs in agriculture
    Full size table 5.6 Conclusions The use of WSNs is rapidly evolving in the agricultural
    sector. Smart nodes with embedded computers can read many types of sensors in
    fields and provide farmers with data that help them make data-driven decisions
    about agricultural tasks. The WSNs have been used for management of agricultural
    inputs such as irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides as well as crop and weather
    monitoring. It is noteworthy to mention that in such studies, WSNs reduced the
    amount of irrigation and increased the efficiency of fertilizer and pesticide
    applications. There are many wireless communication standards and protocols because
    each WSN application requires a specific data rate, frequency, power consumption
    and reception range. The future of WSNs is expected to be bright because wirelessly
    they can do more than one task at the same time such as read more than one sensor
    and transmit data to specific gateways. Nevertheless, WSNs are not yet mainstream
    in agriculture because each application is highly customized. For this reason,
    more research and development are required to make the setup and maintenance of
    WSNs easier. This means that better hardware and more efficient and less complex
    software must be developed. The WSNs should also be designed to be energy efficient
    and to use energy sources that do not cause physical impediments in fields. More
    efficient techniques for fault monitoring and tolerance are necessary. Finally,
    yet importantly, more research is needed to develop more secure ways to transmit
    data. If data transmission is not properly secured, packet replay could occur,
    resulting in potential database corruption and other forms of malice. The WSNs
    have the potential to trigger the next revolution in computing in agriculture.

  analysis: 'This paper reviews the impact of wireless communications on automated
    systems for real-time irrigation management. The review includes power saving
    schemes, energy-harvesting techniques, and the applicability of different wireless
    communications to this system. The reviewed paper provided a list of requirements
    for the system for fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. The paper
    highlighted Zigbee and LoRa as the most suitable wireless protocols for these
    systems. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of implementing such
    systems such as reduced production costs, improved quality of produce, and environmentally
    beneficial solutions.


    **Specific verbatim quotes from the paper that demonstrate its pertinence to the
    outline point and review question are as follows:**


    **Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather) and
    their collection and use:**


    - “Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in agriculture to provide farmers
    with a large amount of information. Precision agriculture (PA) is a management
    strategy that employs information technology to improve quality and production.
    Utilizing wireless sensor technologies and management tools can lead to a highly
    effective, green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs
    information technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs
    for traditional farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations
    and relates the spatial data to management activities. PA involves ﬁve stages,
    namely, (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data analysis, (iv) precision
    ﬁeld operation, and (v) evaluation [4].”


    **Assessing the current state and future potential of real-time, automated irrigation
    management systems:**


    - “WSNs are used as cost-effective processes to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly,
    WSNs have been used in different agricultural applications, such as for monitoring
    climate and using soil nutrient data to forecast the health of crops and the quality
    of agricultural products. Irrigation planning can be predicted using WSNs by observing
    weather conditions (such as temperature and humidity) and soil moisture. Other
    sensor nodes can be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the
    agricultural monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some
    challenges have hindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining
    optimum deployment schemes, measurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,
    cost, communication range, scalability, and fault tolerance [5].”


    **Examining automation across the entire pipeline: data collection to cloud:**


    - “To fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems resulting from the
    long distance between farms and base stations, a mobile data connection service
    can be established by connecting unmanned aerial vehicles or drones with the base
    station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes to relay their data to the
    base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld. However, this solution is
    limited by the quality of service of WSNs.”


    **Highlighting the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the
    integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline:**


    - “For example, the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering
    period can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge
    the selection of the distribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many
    obstacles, the communication link may be weakened or lost as a result of signal
    attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from the battery, thereby preventing
    connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing power depletion
    and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering their limited
    battery power. Although the application of WSNs has increased constantly over
    the years, the manufacturing of batteries has not developed at the same rate [6].
    Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their batteries [7].”


    **Identifying challenges and proposing solutions for fully addressing the point
    and research gaps and proposing solutions:**


    - “Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management
    and highlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be used
    in agriculture.”


    This paper comprehensively reviews the current state of real-time, end-to-end
    automated irrigation management systems. It provides a detailed analysis of the
    different components involved in such systems, from data collection to cloud integration.
    The paper also highlights the importance of interoperability and standardization
    in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management
    pipeline. Finally, the paper identifies challenges and proposes solutions for
    fully addressing the point and research gaps in this field.'

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\

    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\

    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\

    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\
    \ farm ﬁeld-based Internet of Things (IoT) and provided by a solar cell battery\n\
    charger: (a) Agriculture sensor node with related sensor and solar cell, (b) Sink\
    \ and actuator nodes,\nand (c) Gateway node and cloud computing.\n4. Agriculture\
    \ Requirements for IoT\nThe IoT represents the visibility of a group of systems,\
    \ technologies, platforms, and design\nprinciples for joining things, depending\
    \ on the physical surroundings, through the use of the Internet.\nPA is an application\
    \ that can employ the beneﬁts of IoT to increase production efﬁciency, improve\
    \ the\nquality of yields, reduce the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence\
    \ of plant-eating pests or\nplant diseases, alert farmers about farm ﬁres [141],\
    \ and increase the proﬁtability of several agricultural\nproduction schemes. Agriculture\
    \ involves farming, planting, and animal rearing, and it has grown\nunder the\
    \ scope of IoT recently [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and irrigation\
    \ processes\nare the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding,\
    \ rearing, medication, and\nvaccination are essential applications of IoT in the\
    \ agricultural domain [143]. Consequently, several\nIoT modular architectures\
    \ have been proposed and implemented by scholars for PA monitoring (as\npresented\
    \ in Table 8). Real-time ecological information can be remotely gathered from\
    \ the agricultural\nsurroundings based on different sensors, which transmit the\
    \ information to be processed to determine\nproblems, take required actions using\
    \ actuators, or store data.\nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information\
    \ about environmental and physical\nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond\
    \ to the feedback to control or to perform an action over\nthe conditions (Figure\
    \ 3, Part B). The use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number of\n\
    requirements, including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance\
    \ of agricultural\nareas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces\
    \ of rough land, several crops on a single\npiece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, and\neliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements are\napplied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to handle\nthis information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized to make\na decision instead of raw data of the sensor\
    \ [132]. This information can be transmuted to the cloud\ncomputing via gateway\
    \ for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\nReference\
    \ [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node implemented\
    \ for PA\napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were soil moisture,\
    \ temperature, humidity, and\nwind direction and speed sensors to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket”\nplatform was selected for\
    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

  title: 'Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Agriculture: A Review'
  verbatim_quote1: “Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in agriculture to
    provide farmers with a large amount of information. Precision agriculture (PA)
    is a management strategy that employs information technology to improve quality
    and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies and management tools can
    lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management
    strategy that employs information technology to improve agricultural quality and
    production. PA differs for traditional farming in the sense that this process
    accurately identiﬁes variations and relates the spatial data to management activities.
    PA involves ﬁve stages, namely, (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data
    analysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld operation, and (v) evaluation [4].”
  verbatim_quote2: “WSNs are used as cost-effective processes to increase agricultural
    yield. Accordingly, WSNs have been used in different agricultural applications,
    such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient data to forecast the health
    of crops and the quality of agricultural products. Irrigation planning can be
    predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions (such as temperature and
    humidity) and soil moisture. Other sensor nodes can be added to the existing WSN
    to improve the parameters of the agricultural monitoring system and to make the
    network scalable. However, some challenges have hindered the agricultural application
    of WSNs, such as determining optimum deployment schemes, measurement periods,
    routing protocols, energy efﬁciency, cost, communication range, scalability, and
    fault tolerance [5].”

    The CQIRT system was found to provide seasonal data of sufficient quality to replace
    IQIRT devices for continuous monitoring of plant canopy temperatures on a seasonal
    timeframe in the field. The study highlighted the advantages of the CQIRT system,
    including its lower cost and ease of use, which may make it a viable alternative
    in many agricultural settings.


    Specific quantitative results from the study include:

    - Successful transmission rates for the 20 remote CQIRT sensors varied from 88.3%
    to 99.9%, with an average of 97.7% over the 80-day experimental interval.

    - When the two worst performing remote CQIRTs were paired for analysis, at least
    one valid measurement was available 99.5% of the time, suggesting that a pair
    of remote CQIRTs should provide effectively continuous monitoring of canopy temperatures.

    - The remote CQIRTs effectively measured diurnal and seasonal variation in canopy
    temperature and detected differences in canopy temperature associated with irrigation
    treatments.

    - The CQIRT system was found to be suitable for various common uses of plant canopy
    temperature, including irrigation scheduling, quantifying canopy temperature depression,
    and interpreting plant metabolic responses.


    Overall, the study provides evidence that the CQIRT system can provide accurate
    and reliable temperature data for agricultural applications, with advantages in
    cost and ease of use compared to traditional IQIRT systems.'

    Get rights and content Abstract Continuous measurement of plant canopy temperature
    is useful in both research and production agriculture settings. Industrial-quality
    infrared thermometers which are often used for measurement of canopy temperatures,
    while reliable, are not always cost effective. For this study a relatively low-cost,
    consumer-quality infrared thermometer was incorporated into a wireless monitoring
    system intended for use in plant physiological studies and in agricultural production
    settings. The field performance of this low-cost wireless system was compared
    to that of a typical research system based on an industrial-quality infrared thermometer.
    Performance was evaluated in terms of: reliability of data acquisition, quality
    of seasonal temperature measurements, seasonal stability of the consumer-quality
    infrared sensor, and the equivalence of temperatures measured by the consumer-quality
    and industrial-quality temperature sensors. Results indicate that for many common
    uses of plant temperature data, the two sensors provide functionally equivalent
    results. The cost savings and ease of use associated with the low-cost wireless
    temperature monitoring system present advantages over the higher-cost industrial-quality
    sensors which may make them a viable alternative in many agricultural settings.

    Introduction Environmental temperature is dynamic on both diurnal and seasonal
    time scales. Because plants are first and foremost biochemical systems, they are
    affected by temperature in virtually all aspects of their growth and development.
    Air temperature and plant temperature are often similar, particularly during darkness,
    and air temperature is often considered to be a suitable approximation of plant
    temperature. In arid environments, plant temperatures can range from significantly
    less than air temperature under optimal water status to significantly higher than
    air temperature when plant water status is less than optimal. Thermometers, thermocouples,
    and thermistors provide relatively straightforward measurement of air temperature.
    Even though plant temperature can be difficult to measure, the value of such measurements
    is well established (Pinter et al., 2003). Temperature sensors that require direct
    contact with the plant (e.g. thermocouples and thermistors) are useful for point-in-time
    measurements but are ill suited for continuous measurement of plant temperature.
    Non-contact measurement of plant temperature, which is potentially useful in many
    situations, can be accomplished through the use of radiometric surface thermometers
    commonly referred to as infrared thermometers (IRTs). The advantages of infrared
    thermometry in studies of plant temperature include: no requirement for physical
    contact with the plant, capability for continuous measurements, and the ability
    to automate data collection. Additionally since an IRT measures the temperature
    of the material within its field of view, the temperature measured by the IRT
    can represent a collection of leaves comprising a canopy. The cost and complexity
    of infrared thermometers have changed significantly over the 30 years that they
    have been used in agricultural settings. For example, the IRTs that were used
    in our laboratory in the mid 1980s required an external power source and had a
    cost of approximately $ 3000 (USD). Similar instruments today cost approximately
    $ 1500 (USD). The development of the infrared thermocouple (IRt/c) resulted in
    increased simplicity and affordability of instruments for temperature measurements.
    Industrial-quality IRt/cs (IQIRT) are commercially available from a number of
    manufacturers and have been used to monitor plant canopy temperatures in studies
    involving detection of plant water stress (Wanjura and Mahan, 1994, Pinter et
    al., 2003, Peters and Evett, 2004). Industrial-quality IRT devices are widely
    considered suitable for use in both research and agricultural production settings.
    Low-cost infrared temperature sensors have become widely available in the past
    few years. These lower-cost devices are very simple to use and are marketed for
    use in toys, home electronics, and other non-critical applications. Mahan and
    Yeater (2008) recently investigated the utility of a low-cost IRT sensor as a
    replacement for the more expensive IQIRT sensors. They used the term “consumer-quality
    IRT” (CQIRT) to differentiate these devices from the higher-cost and higher-quality
    IQIRTs. The results of their study indicated that a CQIRT sensor would be an appropriate
    substitute for the more expensive IQIRT sensors in certain research and agricultural
    settings. A wireless IRT system based upon a CQIRT sensor has been developed and
    is now commercially available (Smartfield.net). In this study we report the results
    of field and laboratory analysis of the functionality of the low-cost CQIRT sensor
    incorporated into a wireless IRT system. The objectives of the study were to:
    (1) delineate conditions under which the CQIRT system will be equivalent to more
    costly IQIRT systems; (2) document the ability of the CQIRT devices to detect
    and quantify canopy temperature differences in the field; (3) assess the stability
    of the devices on a seasonal timeframe; (4) determine reliability of data transmission
    on a seasonal timeframe under field conditions. The hypothesis of this study is
    that a CQIRT sensor, incorporated into a wireless data collection system, will
    provide seasonal data of sufficient quality to replace IQIRT devices for continuous
    monitoring of plant canopy temperatures on a seasonal timeframe in the field.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Wireless infrared thermometry system for CQIRT The
    wireless infrared thermometry system used in the study is a Smartcrop© Automated
    Crop Stress Monitoring System (Smartfield Inc., Lubbock, TX, U.S.A.). The Smartcrop©
    system uses a Zytemp model TN901 infrared thermometer (Zytemp HsinChu, Taiwan
    R.O.C.) as a temperature sensor. The use of this consumer-quality IRT (CQIRT)
    for agricultural applications has been reported by Mahan and Yeater (2008). The
    Smartcrop© system consists of a base/controller unit and 1–16 remote IRT units.
    The base/controller serves as a data logger that collects data from remote IRTs
    at a user-defined interval and provides storage and retrieval of the collected
    data. Data collection from the base/controller can be accomplished via serial
    communications’ interface that can be directly connected to a computer or various
    wireless communication devices (e.g. cell phone or UHF radio). The remote IRT
    consists of a CQIRT sensor (Zytemp) and the electronics necessary for acquiring,
    storing, processing, and transmitting temperature measurements. The remote IRTs
    can record the temperature output at a 1-min interval. Temperature values collected
    by the remote IRTs are averaged every 15 min and transmitted to the base/controller
    on 15-min intervals via a low-power radio link. Both collection and transmission
    time-intervals can be defined by the user. The base/controller stores temperature
    data in on-board memory for subsequent retrieval. The remote IRTs reliably transmit
    data up to 200 m with a low-cost dipole antenna (170 mm × 10 mm MHW series dipole
    Antenna Factor, Merlin, OR, U.S.A.) on the base/controller and an omni-directional
    1/4 wave antenna on the remote IRT. The Smartcrop© system was installed in an
    open area with no interfering structures between the base/controller and the remote
    IRTs. Topography and interfering structures will reduce the transmission range.
    The remote IRTs are powered by 4 AAA batteries that are user replaceable. Replacement
    of the batteries every 60 days provided adequate operational power. 2.2. Industrial-quality
    infrared thermometry system The “wired” temperature monitoring system used for
    comparisons to the Smartcrop© wireless system is representative of typical installations
    in our laboratory over a 10-year period. The infrared sensor used in this system
    was an Exergen model IRt/c.2 type K 27C (Exergen, Watertown, MA). This sensor,
    which will be referred to as the industrial-quality IRT (IQIRT), is recommended
    by the manufacturer for use in agricultural applications. The IQIRT was connected
    to a Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger for recording temperatures. The data
    collection interval was 1 min with 15 min averages calculated and stored for retrieval.
    Thermocouple extension wire was used to connect the IRTs to the data logger in
    the field. 2.3. Assessment of data loss rate of CQIRT system Between December
    2007 and March 2008 cotton canopy temperatures were collected in the field in
    Narrabri, NSW, Australia. Twenty remote CQIRTs and 2 base/controllers (10 remote
    CQIRTs per base/controller) were installed in an experiment that consisted of
    5 irrigation treatments with 4 replicated plots in each treatment. One remote
    IRT was installed in each replication of each irrigation treatment. The remote
    IRTs were installed in the field on 24 December at an angle of approximately 70°
    and a height of 10 cm above the canopy and were adjusted periodically to maintain
    a distance of approximately 10 cm from the canopy. This distance from target resulted
    in a field of view that was approximately 10 cm in diameter. The IRTs were installed
    on the south side of the canopy to prevent shading of the canopy. 2.4. Comparisons
    of pre- and post-season performance of Smartcrop© remote IRTs In this analysis
    the temperature readings of 10 remote CQIRTs (randomly selected from the set of
    20) were compared to a thermocouple reading in October of 2007 and again in April
    of 2008 following more than 80 consecutive days in the field and two trans-Pacific
    shipping flights (U.S.A. to Australia and return). Pre- and post-season performance
    of the Smartcrop© remote IRT units was assessed in the laboratory at constant
    temperatures with a controlled temperature system that uses a set of thermoelectric
    controllers to maintain specified temperatures in a series of aluminum target
    blocks (7.5 cm × 5 cm). The surfaces of the thermal blocks were covered with copper
    plates that were maintained at a specified temperature through the thermoelectric
    controller. The temperature of the thermal block during each measuring period
    was monitored with a fine-wire thermocouple (type K) attached to an Omega Model
    HH21 microprocessor thermometer (Omega Engineering Inc, Stamford, CT). The temperature
    of the thermal blocks was adjusted through a 10–50 °C thermal range to provide
    a range of temperatures for assessment. For each temperature reading the Smartcrop©
    remote IRTs were fixed at 2.5 cm above and perpendicular to the thermal plate.
    Five measurements were made and recorded at 10-s intervals with the Smartcrop©
    remote IRT and the thermocouple for each temperature setting. 2.5. Comparison
    of consumer-quality and industrial-quality IRTs Canopy temperatures were monitored
    in a cotton canopy using 16 IRTs (8 Smartcrop© remote CQIRTs and 8 IQIRTs) in
    Lubbock, TX over a 30-day period between 16 July and 15 August 2008. The plants
    were grown under 2 irrigation levels (6 mm per day and 2 mm per day via subsurface
    drip) to provide a broad range of canopy temperatures. The 16 IRTs were installed
    in the field on 8 July 2008. Four CQIRT sensors (Smartcrop© remote IRTs) and 4
    IQIRTs were installed in each irrigation treatment. The 8 CQIRTs were installed
    at an angle of approximately 70° and a height of 10 cm above the canopy (resulting
    in a field of view that was approximately 10 cm in diameter) and were adjusted
    periodically to maintain this distance. The 8 IQIRTs were installed at an angle
    of approximately 70° and a height of 20 cm above the canopy (resulting in a field
    of view that was approximately 10 cm in diameter) and were adjusted periodically
    to maintain this distance. All IRTs were installed on the north side of the canopy
    to prevent shading of the canopy. Data from the remote CQIRTs was collected as
    15-min means of 1 min readings by a Smartcrop© base/controller and data from the
    IQIRTs was collected as 15-min means of 1 min readings with a Campbell Scientific
    CR1000 data logger. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to summarize all
    variability in temperature readings as well as relationships among the 16 IRTs.
    PCA was conducted using R software (R Development Core Team, 2008). 3. Results/discussion
    3.1. Comparison of IQIRT and Smartcrop© remote IRTs (CQIRT) in the field The IQIRT
    used in this study (Exergen model Irt/c.2 K27C) has been used for the continuous
    determination of canopy temperatures in a large number of agricultural studies
    over the past decade and is recommended by the manufacturer for such applications.
    In an earlier paper, Mahan and Yeater (2008) used 5 days of field data to compare
    the canopy temperatures measured by IQIRTs with those measured by CQIRT (Zytemp)
    sensors in a prototype wireless remote IRT package. In the current study, we sought
    to more fully define the differences between the two IRT types, and paired them
    for measurements of canopy temperature in a cotton field with 2 irrigation treatments
    in Lubbock, TX over a 30-day measurement interval during the summer of 2008 (16
    July–15 August). Fig. 1 regresses the patterns of canopy temperature collected
    over the 30-day interval. The canopy temperatures are the mean of 15 min of measurements
    collected at 15-s intervals. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Comparisons
    of temperature readings from 8 consumer-quality IRTs (Zytemp) and 8 industrial-quality
    IRTs (Exergen) over a 30-day period (16 July–15 August) in a cotton field in Lubbock,
    TX. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that allows
    relationships among multiple variables to be displayed in as few as two dimensions
    (i.e., principal component axes, PC1 and PC2). It can be based on either covariances
    or correlations, and it is a useful approach for investigating the degree to which
    variables covary over time. We used PCA, based on correlations among the 8 IRTs
    within each treatment, to summarize all variability in temperature readings. Results
    of the PCA were illustrated in a biplot (Fig. 2), where each observation (n =
    2076 per treatment) is plotted using scores for PC1 and PC2. Arrows, representing
    the contribution of each sensor to each axis, were used to illustrate the relationships
    among the 8 IRTs. PCA was conducted using R (R Development Core Team, 2008). Together,
    the first two axes of the PCA accounted for 98.8% (Treatment A) and 99.0% (Treatment
    B) of the variability within the 30 days of temperature measurements from the
    16 IRTs (Fig. 2). Moreover, results of the PCA indicate a high degree of consistency
    among all IRTs. In both treatments, all IRTs were predominantly related to PC1,
    which accounted for >98% of the variability. However, there were small systematic
    differences between IRT types, with the Zytemp and Exergen sensors clustering
    together on PC2. On a few occasions, the Zytemp sensors overestimated temperatures
    compared to the Exergen sensors (seen as the points with high values of PC2).
    Nevertheless, PC2 only accounted for <1% of the total variability, regardless
    of treatment. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Biplot of the principal
    components analysis of the temperature measurements made by the Zytemp (Z) and
    Exergen (E) sensors in two irrigation treatments. The PCA summarizes variation
    in 8 dimensions (8 sensors per treatment) using only 2 dimensions (PC1 and PC2).
    Each axis represents a linear combination of the 8 sensors, and percent of overall
    variability accounted for by each axis is denoted in the axis labels. Individual
    points represent the observations (i.e., temperature readings) at each time point,
    and there were a total of 2076 measurements made over the course of the study.
    To illustrate the relationships among the sensors, correlations were calculated
    between temperature readings from each sensor and each PCA axis, and these correlations
    are reflected in the arrows. All sensors were highly correlated with PC1, and
    PC1 accounted for the majority of variation in both treatments. Overall, within
    an irrigation treatment the canopy temperatures collected by the two types of
    IRTs are remarkably similar. As previously discussed it is very difficult to separate
    temperature differences between two locations in the canopy from differences that
    are a result of the different types of IRT sensor. Thus differences ascribed to
    differences between IRT types may be exaggerated. The temperatures measured by
    the two types of IRT sensors agree within ±0.5 °C which is within the ±2 °C range
    specified accurate by the respective manufacturers. Thus, for the purposes of
    this study, they appear to be functionally equivalent. 3.2. Quality of the collected
    data While a wireless IRT system provides enhanced ease of use, the lack of a
    physical connection between the IRT and its base/controller presents the possibility
    of transmission-related data loss. The extent of data loss was assessed in an
    experiment in which cotton canopy temperatures were monitored in a cotton field
    in Australia during the 80-day period between 31 December 2007 and 19 March 2008.
    A perfect transmission rate over the 80-day analysis interval would have produced
    7680 temperature measurements for each of 20 IRTs. However, one documented retrieval
    error during the experimental interval resulted in the loss 19 measurement points
    for all 20 remote IRTs resulting in 7661 possible data points per IRT. Table 1
    shows the performance of the 20 remote IRTs over the measurement interval. The
    percentage of successful transmissions for the remote IRTs varied from a low of
    88.3% to a high of 99.9%. The average for all 20 remote IRTs over the experimental
    interval was 97.7%. In our experience IRTs are commonly installed in pairs within
    experimental units. When the two worst performing remote IRTs were paired for
    analysis, at least one valid measurement was available 99.5% of the time. This
    result suggests that a pair of remote IRTs should provide effectively continuous
    monitoring of canopy temperatures. Table 1. Ranking of successful transmissions

    and 16) 99.5 72.8 Reliable transmission of temperature measurements from the IRT
    is an important consideration in the use of a wireless data collection system.
    The wired IQIRT systems are generally quite reliable with data errors generally
    limited to problems with degradation of thermocouple wiring that connects the
    IRTs and the data logger. Wiring problems are typically a result of mechanical
    problems with wiring resulting from equipment and personnel moving within the
    experiment or rodent damage. These errors are generally readily detectable and
    easily repaired by replacement of the damaged wire. In the case of the wireless
    IRT system there is no wire that can be damaged. However, the radio transmissions
    between the remote IRT and the base/controller are subject to error. Factors that
    have the potential to affect the successful transfer of data between the remote
    IRT and base/controller include; transmission range, battery status of the remote
    IRTs, and the number of remote IRTs associated with a given base/controller. The
    successful transmission range for data varies according to the type of antenna
    that is attached to the receiver. While the antenna attached to the receiver can
    be changed, the antenna in the remote IRT is fixed. In this experiment the antenna
    attached to the base/controller was an inexpensive dipole antenna. There was no
    correlation between the distance from a remote IRT to the base/controller at distances
    between 100 m and 200 m (data not shown) suggesting that the dipole antenna has
    a reliable range of at least 200 m. Informal analysis using other antenna designs
    (YAGI and omni-directional) indicates that reliable communication can be achieved
    at a distance of 1000 m. The remote IRT is powered by 4 AAA batteries inside the
    unit that provide sufficient power for reliable transmissions for approximately
    60 days at a data transmission interval of 15 min. Battery voltage is included
    for each data point and can be monitored thus allowing replacement of batteries
    prior degradation of data transmission. The remote IRTs conserve battery power
    by activating their radio transmitters (for less than 5 s) on 15-min intervals
    in order to transmit 15-min averages to the base/controller. The radio receiver
    on the base/controller is continuously in a “receive” mode. As the number of remote
    IRTs associated with a base/controller increases, the probability of a failure
    to receive a 15-min transmission increases. Testing indicates that a base/controller
    can effectively communicate with up to 16 remote IRTs. 3.3. Quantitative analysis
    of canopy temperatures In the experiment conducted in NSW, Australia cotton, the
    remote IRTs effectively measured diurnal and seasonal variation in canopy temperature
    and detected the differences in canopy temperature that are associated with irrigation
    treatments (Table 2). Though the range of canopy temperatures varied among the
    treatments (see Table 2), the standard errors of the 30-day means of the 4 remote
    IRTs in each irrigation treatment were quite similar. Table 2. Summary of canopy
    temperature measured over an 80-day period (31 December 2007–19 March 2008) in
    a cotton field in Narrabri, Australia. Irrigation treatment indicates targeted
    percentage of daily ET replaced on a two-day irrigation interval. Irrigation treatment

    temperatures over a representative 30-day interval from 6 February to 7 March
    2008 of the Australian field study is shown for the means of the 25%, 50% and
    100% irrigation treatments in Fig. 3. The mean of each treatment represents 4
    remote IRTs in each of the irrigation treatments. Differences among the treatments
    are evident. The standard error of the mean among the remote IRTs in each treatment
    represents both the variability among the 4 remote IRTs in the treatment and the
    variability in canopy temperature among plants in the treatments (Fig. 3). Since
    it is infeasible to simultaneously monitor the temperature of identical portions
    of the canopy with multiple remote IRTs, the two sources of error cannot be effectively
    separated. Given the combined sources of error the observed pattern of standard
    error suggests that the remote IRTs are capable of providing continuous canopy
    temperature data of the quality needed for metabolic and water deficit studies.

    irrigation treatments designed to replace the designated fraction of ET on a 2-day
    irrigation interval. The means are of 4 remote IRT devices in each of the water
    treatments with the standard error of the mean shown for each treatment. The horizontal
    line in the figure marks the 28 °C value for cotton optimal temperature. 3.4.
    Pre- and post-season temperature stability In order to determine the stability
    of the Smartcrop© remote IRTs over time, temperature readings of 10 of the remote
    IRTs were compared to temperature readings of thermocouples using a controlled
    temperature device before and after a field deployment. A comparison of the results
    of the pre- and post-season temperature tests is shown in Fig. 4. A linear regression
    analysis of the remote IRT readings as a function of the temperature of the target,
    as determined by a thermocouple, results in similar behavior. The zero intercepts
    (0.94 for pre-season versus 1.46 for post-season) and slopes (1.04 for pre-season
    versus 0.96 for post-season) differed slightly while the correlation coefficients
    were identical (r = 0.998). There does not appear to be a functionally important
    change in performance over the growing season. It is perhaps worth noting that
    the Zytemp sensor units can be replaced in the remote IRTs for approximately $
    20 (US) so there would be no pressing need to use sensors over multiple seasons.

    target was measured in the laboratory with both the consumer-quality IRT and a
    thermocouple. Each point represents the mean of 5 measurements made sequentially
    at 10-s intervals. Standard errors of the means are smaller than the data markers.
    Regression lines are shown for pre and post deployment values along with a 1:1
    line. 3.5. Utility of the Smartcrop© system in research and production settings
    One goal of this study was to determine the suitability of the Smartcrop© IRT
    system as a replacement for the higher-cost IRT devices that are commonly employed
    for irrigation control and physiological studies in plants. The lower cost of
    the CQIRT system, in comparison to the IQIRT, will allow for the deployment of
    an increased number of IRTs for a given cost and thus provide more measurements
    of plant canopy variability. Four common uses of plant canopy temperature are
    discussed in the following paragraphs. The use of continuous measurement of canopy
    temperature has been used in irrigation scheduling by the BIOTIC method (Wanjura
    and Mahan, 1994, Wanjura et al., 1995, Mahan et al., 2005). This method compares
    measured canopy temperature to a biologically identified estimate of optimum plant
    temperature to provide an indication of the water status of the crop. The biological
    thermal optimum, which is used to interpret canopy temperatures, is a laboratory-derived
    value that typically is determined at a resolution of ±0.5 °C. It is evident that
    the results of temperature measurement with the Smartcrop© IRT devices, which
    is within the ±0.5 °C range, would be suitable for use in implementing the BIOTIC
    irrigation scheduling method. Plant canopy temperatures have been used to document
    differences between canopy and air temperatures. The relationship between canopy
    temperature and air temperature has been used as a tool for identifying plants
    with enhanced performance under water deficit conditions (Balota et al., 2007).
    Canopy temperature depression (CTD), the differential between ambient air and
    plant canopy temperatures, is a tool that has been used to interpret and evaluate
    plant response to environmental stress. Balota et al. (2007) reported canopy temperature
    depressions in winter wheat that ranged from 10 to 3 °C. Similarly, in another
    study conducted on spring wheat (Amani et al., 1996) there were differences in
    mean canopy temperature depressions ranging from −2.8 °C (early season) to −8.2
    °C (late season). Canopy temperature differences of this magnitude could be detected
    and quantified using a Smartcrop© IRT system. The relationship between plant temperature
    and metabolic responses has been used to define metabolic limitations on plant
    metabolism in agricultural systems. Examples of the use of canopy temperature
    measurements in metabolic studies include: modeling of seedling emergence (Mahan
    and Gitz, 2007); prediction of in vivo enzyme function (Mahan, 2000); and prediction
    of herbicide efficacy and resistance (Light et al., 2001, Mahan et al., 2006).
    In each of these approaches, the resolution of temperature that can be achieved
    in the laboratory is on the order of ±1 °C. The results of this study indicate
    that the Smartcrop© remote IRT is capable of providing plant temperature data
    at an appropriate resolution for such analyses. The suitability of the Smartcrop©
    IRT system is ultimately dependent on the intended use of the temperature data
    collected by the device. In regard to the above-mentioned uses of plant canopy
    temperature in plant research and production, it is concluded that the Smartcrop©
    IRT is sufficiently accurate for each use. There are uses of plant canopy temperature
    that require resolution of temperature on a finer scale than is possible with
    the Smartcrop© devices (Kacira et al., 2002, Xiao et al., 2006) for such uses,
    IQIRTs would be more appropriate instruments. 4. Conclusion The primary advantages
    of the Smartcrop© IRT system compared to the more widely used IRTs include: (1)
    wireless operation that is more suitable in many research and production applications
    and (2) reduced cost that, for a given expenditure, could allow for the deployment
    of a larger number of devices for a given expenditure. The results of this initial
    study indicate that the CQIRT sensors incorporated into the Smartcrop© remote
    IRT system provide resolution and reliability that are sufficient for many common
    uses of continuously monitored plant canopy temperatures. References Amani et

    Abstract Many agricultural studies rely on infrared sensors for remote measurement
    of surface temperatures for crop status monitoring and estimating sensible and
    latent heat fluxes. Historically, applications for these non-contact thermometers
    employed the use of hand-held or stationary industrial infrared thermometers (IRTs)
    wired to data loggers. Wireless sensors in agricultural applications are a practical
    alternative, but the availability of low cost wireless IRTs is limited. In this
    study, we designed prototype narrow (10°) field of view wireless infrared sensor
    modules and evaluated the performance of the IRT sensor by comparing temperature
    readings of an object (Tobj) against a blackbody calibrator in a controlled temperature
    room at ambient temperatures of 15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C, and 45 °C. Additional comparative
    readings were taken over plant and soil samples alongside a hand-held IRT and
    over an isothermal target in the outdoors next to a wired IRT. The average root
    mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) between the collected IRT
    object temperature readings and the blackbody target ranged between 0.10 and 0.79
    °C. The wireless IRT readings also compared well with the hand-held IRT and wired
    industrial IRT. Additional tests performed to investigate the influence of direct
    radiation on IRT measurements indicated that housing the sensor in white polyvinyl
    chloride provided ample shielding for the self-compensating circuitry of the IR
    detector. The relatively low cost of the wireless IRT modules and repeatable measurements
    against a blackbody calibrator and commercial IR thermometers demonstrated that
    these wireless prototypes have the potential to provide accurate surface radiometric
    temperature readings in outdoor applications. Further studies are needed to thoroughly
    test radio frequency communication and power consumption characteristics in an
    outdoor setting. Research highlights ► Readings of low cost infrared thermometer
    measure up to blackbody calibrator. ► Wireless infrared thermometer compensates
    well for changes in sensor body temperature. ► Wireless narrow FOV sensor provides
    ease of stationary mounting on moving sprinkler platform. Previous article in

    agricultureRemote sensingWireless sensors 1. Introduction Infrared thermometers
    (IRTs) have been widely used in agricultural research to remotely measure surface
    temperatures and develop vegetation stress indexes (Jackson et al., 1981, Colaizzi
    et al., 2003), monitor crop canopy temperatures and schedule irrigations based
    on plant feedback (Jones, 2004, Peters and Evett, 2007), predict crop yields (Pinter
    et al., 1983, Irmak et al., 2000, Ajayi and Olufayo, 2004), or estimate sensible
    and latent heat fluxes (e.g. Kustas and Norman, 1997, Kalma and Jupp, 1990). Historically,
    these applications employed the use of stationary industrial IRTs wired to data
    loggers. These sensors can be expensive, cumbersome, and impractical for commercial
    on-farm applications. Wireless IRTs in agricultural applications are a more practical
    alternative, but their availability is limited. Economical radiation thermometry
    detectors with both analog and digital outputs are readily available on the market
    and have been used in the automobile and medical industry, but there are few studies
    concerning these sensors in agricultural settings. A specific example of a wireless
    IRT module that has been evaluated in agricultural applications includes the low-cost
    wireless IRT work by Mahan and Yeater (2008) and Mahan et al. (2010). Although
    this IRT had a wide (1:1) field of view (FOV) and required the targets of interest
    be located near the IRT (approximately within 10 cm), it was reported to be similar
    in accuracy to an industrial-quality sensor over a 13–35 °C range of target temperatures
    in an outdoor environment. These IRTs are now available on the market and compared
    well with measurements from a commercial wired IRT when placed in a cotton field
    in Australia and monitored over a four-month period (Mahan et al., 2010). In separate
    work, O''Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) constructed a wireless IRT sensor by interfacing
    a commercial narrow field of view IRT (IRT/c.5-T-80F/27C, Exergen,1 Inc., Watertown,
    Mass.) with an off-the-shelf radio frequency (RF) module using the open ZigBee
    (IEEE Std. 802.15.4, 2007) communication protocol (O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2007).
    The Zigbee protocol is characterized by a slow data transfer rate (250 kbp @ 2.4
    GHz), power management to ensure low power consumption, and is optimized for short-duty
    cycle applications which are critical for power conservation. An overview of sensor
    technologies and standards for wireless communications in agriculture are summarized
    by Wang et al. (2006) and will not be discussed in this manuscript. A network
    of these wireless IRTs was created by mounting the IRTs onto a center pivot lateral
    for monitoring crop canopy temperatures using methods described by O''Shaughnessy
    and Evett (2010). Temperature data were transmitted to an embedded computer at
    the pivot point and used in an algorithm for automatic irrigation scheduling.
    The development of reliable wireless network systems that transmit data to a base
    station computer or nearby data logging device increases the convenience and flexibility
    of sensor use (ease of mobility and reduced maintenance of wiring) for researchers
    and producers. The use of an open communication protocol will allow incorporation
    of sensors developed by various manufacturers into sensor network systems without
    the added expense of specialized receivers and additional interface software at
    the base station level. Undoubtedly, dependable wireless networks of infrared
    thermometers that are capable of being integrated into agricultural systems for
    crop monitoring and machine control will also aid in the commercialization of
    precision agricultural applications. As with any scientific measurement, there
    is an inevitable amount of uncertainty when assessing measurements made by sensors;
    these uncertainties must be addressed to minimize error (Taylor, 1997). Infrared
    thermometers measure thermal radiation emitted by an object. All objects at temperatures
    greater than absolute zero radiate energy in the infrared range (Kaplan, 2007).
    Thermal radiation emitted from an object is proportional to the fourth power of
    the absolute temperature of an object''s surface: (1) where q is the emitted radiation,
    σ is Stefan Boltzmann''s constant (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4), ɛ is emissivity, and
    T is absolute surface temperature of the object (K). Radiation emitted from a
    target is a function of emissivity and surface temperature. However, the output
    of a conventional IRT depends on the temperature difference between the detector
    and target and the sensor and is a weighted average of the radiating components
    within its FOV (Wanjura and Upchurch, 2001). An IRT senses not only the emitted
    radiation but also the reflected thermal radiation from the target surface and
    the radiation from the internal surface of the IRT (Baker et al., 2001). The degree
    to which an IRT is sensitive to reflected and internal radiation is affected by
    the FOV (Brewster, 1992). Uncertainties associated with infrared thermometer signals
    are a combination of the effects of ambient temperature, the alignment of the
    thermometer, detector noise and non-linearity (Shimizu and Ishii, 2008), calibration
    shifts, the inability to eliminate or properly account for the influence of detector
    temperature on the measurement (Baker et al., 2001), true target emissivity values,
    and background radiation. Our interest in a narrow FOV wireless IRT is to provide
    the ability to accurately monitor row crops using sensor networks located on moving
    irrigation systems (Sadler et al., 2002, Peters and Evett, 2004). A sensor with
    a narrow FOV can be mounted on a pivot lateral and maintained at a stationary
    height. This is in contrast to a wider FOV sensor located on a mast in a field
    which requires periodically adjusting its height above the crop canopy as it grows.
    An IRT with a 10° FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral (∼5.1 m above the ground), looking
    slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique angle to the vertical mast and
    at a 45° (in the horizontal plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have
    a resolve of approximately 0.7 m2 of crop surface. The surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical foot print with the vertical axis estimated as: (2.1) where h
    is the height of the pivot lateral above the ground, α is the IRT''s FOV, and
    Li is the path length from the IRT to the canopy. The horizontal axis, a, can
    be approximated as: (2.2) and the area of the ellipse: (2.3) Positioning of an
    IRT in this manner will help reduce the amount of soil viewed by the sensor (Peters
    and Evett, 2004) when canopy is less than full and help to reduce sun angle effects
    by averaging the temperature readings of shaded and unshaded sides of the canopy
    (Fig. 1). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Graphic showing location
    of wireless infrared thermometer on pivot lateral and projected field of view
    (elliptical footprint with axis a and b). A fundamental difficulty with IR thermometry
    is that all objects emit thermal radiation, including the internal surface of
    an IR detector. Each type of detector, whether it is thermal, photon, or pyroelectric
    is strongly affected by ambient temperature changes which result in temperature
    drift. Temperature drift can be corrected using temperature compensation circuitry,
    temperature regulation, auto null circuitry, chopping, and isothermal protection
    (Omega Engineering, 2000). Although a narrow FOV IRT has the advantage of sensing
    temperature from a homogeneous target when aimed from the appropriate distance,
    there is the disadvantage that a greater percentage of the total incident radiation
    received by the detector will be from its own temperature due to internally reflected
    radiation. This makes narrow FOV sensors more sensitive to changes in their own
    body temperature (Bugbee et al., 1999). Currently, there are a limited number
    of low cost wireless IRT sensors available for retail. An IRT with a narrow FOV
    has the advantage of viewing a homogeneous sample at a height fixed above the
    crop canopy under partial canopy coverage, but the inherent problem of temperature
    output drift due to changes in ambient air temperature have to be overcome. Our
    objectives for this study were to: (1) develop a low cost, wireless, narrow FOV
    IRT sensor; and (2) evaluate the accuracy of the output readings under changing
    ambient temperatures and direct radiation. A brief evaluation of RF signal strength
    of the sensor module was performed to indicate the range of communication using
    whip antennas. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sensor specification The specifications
    of the infrared thermometer sensor, MLX90614-BCF (Melexis, Ypres, Belgium) are
    summarized in Table 1. This sensor was chosen because of its relatively low cost,
    narrow FOV (collimated to 10° by the manufacturer), and capability for non-contact
    radiometric surface temperature measurements. The sensor package is comprised
    of a long-wave filter that passes radiation from 5.5 to 14 μm, a thermopile detector
    chip and a second unique proprietary signal conditioning chip. The two voltages
    (Vs and Vo) corresponding respectively to: (1) the sensor body temperature (Tsb,
    K); and (2) the object or target temperature (Tobj, K) which is internally compensated
    by Tsb. Voltage outputs were converted to temperature readings using the equation,
    Ti = Vj × 0.02 in K and later converted to °C, where Ti represents either Tobj
    or Tsb and Vj is either Vo or Vs. As with any radiometric sensor, the accuracy
    of this thermometer can be influenced by thermal gradients induced across the
    sensor package (Melexis Data Sheet, 2009). Table 1. Wireless sensor module characteristics.

    We designed electronic circuitry involving a microprocessor to interface the digital
    output of the Melexis IRT and analog output of the battery pack with a wireless
    Zigbee RF module (XBee platform, Series 2, Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.).
    Sensor data (i.e. Tobj, Tsb), battery voltage, and IRT address (configured with
    dip switches), were collected and stored at the microprocessor level until sent
    to the base station lap top computer using RF telemetry. Temperature data were
    collected every 12 s, averaged and stored every minute. Battery voltage was measured
    and stored every minute. Transmission frequency, data averaging, and the cyclic
    period for the “sleep” state of the RF module were programmed through the microprocessor.
    The circuit was designed with two voltage regulators, one controlling power exclusively
    to the Melexis sensor. The average current draw after testing 5 sensor modules
    was 0.5 mA when the voltage regulator to the Melexis sensor was powered “off.”
    The average current draw was 10 mA when the sensor was powered “on.” During data
    transmission, the sensor modules drew an average of 33 mA, which is governed by
    the design of the XBee series II module. Application code for the sensor module
    processor was created using CodeVision AVR (V2.04.6, Progressive Resources, LLC,
    Indianapolis, Ind.), which is a commercial C compiler for Atmel AVR microcontrollers.
    Data were arranged into the application programming interface (API) format to
    extend the level of interaction between the sensor nodes and the host application
    (Fig. 2). Use of the API format allows detection of a complete data string by
    recognizing the start of the data packet, “7E” (a static value), size of the array
    to parse (based on the number of bytes in the data string), confirmation that
    the string was received from a sensor (based on the packet type and address of
    the sending node), and a means for error checking the data sent by validating
    the received checksum value. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Initial
    line is sample data packet sent by wireless IRT sensor node and received by the
    XBee modem. Pertinent packs are labeled below data line; data is transmitted in
    hexadecimal. Each sensor module was powered with 4 AA nickel metal hydride (NiMH)
    batteries. The batteries were housed in an external white, weather proofed poly
    vinyl chloride (PVC) housing and recharged with a 3 W solar panel (model SC3,
    Sunwize SolCharger, Hudson, Mass.). The combination of off-the-shelf components
    and circuit design will hereinafter be referred to as a wireless IRT (Fig. 3).
    Wireless data for the temperature comparisons discussed in this manuscript were
    collected by an XBee modem connected to a laptop computer using a program running
    under Visual Studio 2008 Ver. 9.2. (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.). Download

    2.2. Temperature comparisons To evaluate the accuracy of the wireless IRTs and
    reduce uncertainties in error measurement, three methods were used: (1) calibration
    against a variable blackbody; (2) spot temperature comparisons of soil and vegetation
    samples against a commercial hand-held infrared thermometer; and (3) continuous
    temperature comparisons over a highly uniform target against an industrial wired
    IRT in the outdoors. 2.2.1. Sensor vs. blackbody calibrator Temperature output
    instability of the wireless IRTs caused by changes in ambient air temperature
    was measured by comparing the IRT readings to the known set point temperature
    of the blackbody in a number of different ambient temperatures. The variable temperature
    blackbody calibrator (CES100, Electro Optical Industries, Inc., Santa Barbara,
    Calif.) and the wireless IRTs were placed inside of a 3 m × 3 m × 3 m temperature
    control chamber (Environmental Growth Chambers, Inc., Chagrin Falls, Ohio). The
    chamber and sensor body temperatures were brought to equilibrium, after which
    batch readings from the sensors were collected. A data logger (Campbell Scientific,
    model CR 3000, Logan, Utah) was used to automatically control the set point of
    the blackbody and its chiller unit. A special character was broadcast by the data
    logger through an XBee modem to the wireless IRT sensor modules when the blackbody
    had reached a programmed set point. Temperatures, Tobj and Tsb, and battery voltage
    measurements were sent via RF telemetry, only after receiving a special character,
    to a laptop computer located just outside the chamber. The blackbody temperature
    was automatically stepped from 15 to 55 °C (the expected range of canopy or soil
    temperatures during the growing season) in 5-degree increments using an RS-232
    communication link between the data logger and blackbody controller. Twenty data
    samples were collected from each sensor at each blackbody set point for a total
    of 180 data points per sensor per ambient air temperature. Wireless sensor IRT
    readings were taken in four different ambient temperatures (15 °C, 25 °C, 35 °C,
    and 45 °C). These represented ambient temperature ranges that were expected during
    a typical summer growing season at Bushland, TX (CPRL Climate Data files, 2010).
    Although our technique was automated, it was similar to methods performed by Kalma
    et al. (1988) and Bugbee et al. (1999). 2.2.2. Wireless IRT vs. AgriTherm hand-held
    thermometer The wireless IRT was evaluated against the AgriTherm II, a portable
    hand-held infrared thermometer (Everest Interscience Inc., Tucson, Ariz.). The
    sensor module and AgriTherm II were clamped onto separate masts and placed alongside
    one another with a nadir view angle over soil and vegetation samples. The soil
    was 0.25 m (depth) of dry Pullman Clay Loam spread evenly over a 0.46 m × 0.31
    m pan. Vegetation temperature readings were taken over grain sorghum (Sorghum
    bicolor (L.) Moench). The AgriTherm II had a zoom lens and pulsating laser; its
    field of view was adjusted to meet that of the wireless IRT and it emissivity
    was dialed to 0.98. 2.2.3. Wireless IRT vs. wired IRT and thermal imager A third
    comparison involved the use of a wireless IRT and one wired IRT (Exergen model
    IRT/c.5-T-80F/27C) mounted on masts and positioned above a black rectangular aluminum
    block target located outdoors. The wired IRT contained a Type-T thermocouple (copper-constantan)
    detector with specifications similar to the thermopile detector in the wireless
    IRT. The two sensors had the same FOV, were filtered to select spectral responses
    in the 8 to 14 μm range, and measured at comparable levels of accuracy near room
    temperature. The aluminum block target over which both type of sensors were positioned
    had dimensions of 81.3 cm × 38.1 cm × 7.6 cm (tall), and a measured emissivity
    value of 0.99. The method to measure emissivity is described in (Kaplan, 2007).
    Temperature measurements between the wired and wireless IRTs were made over a
    24-h period. Data from the wireless IRTs were collected by a lap top computer
    located in a remote building and time stamped by the acquisition program. The
    wired IRT did not require excitation, rather the voltage differences generated
    between the dissimilar wire types were amplified, collected, and time stamped
    by a data logger (model 21X, Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah). The clocks for
    the computer and data logger were synchronized prior to data collection for paired
    analysis. The temperature of the aluminum block was extracted from digital images
    taken periodically with a FLIR thermal imager (model SC2000 and ThermaCAM Researcher
    Pro 2.8 software, FLIR Systems, Billerica, Mass.) at a nadir view angle on DOYs
    89, 90 and 91, 2010. 2.2.4. Response to temperature transients with and without
    a heat sink Thermal mass requirements for sensor body temperature stabilization
    were investigated with the detector exposed to heating caused by direct radiation
    while: (1) embedded in an aluminum socket and the detector and circuit interface
    board enclosed inside of a white polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic sleeve; and
    (2) with the detector and circuit interface board enclosed only in the plastic
    sleeve. Transient incident radiation trials were used to simulate rapid changes
    in radiation on the sensor, which would affect sensor body temperature. Such changes
    may occur, for example, when the sun is intermittently blocked by cloud cover.
    All trials were performed in the controlled temperature room. During each trial,
    the sensor module was aimed at the blackbody target with a constant target temperature,
    TBB (°C). Incident radiation was increased and decreased by turning on and off
    a halogen lamp aimed at the sensor module. A shield isolated the blackbody from
    the radiation. The blackbody target was varied in 5-degree increments as described
    previously, and the testing was repeated in ambient temperatures of 20 °C, 25
    °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C. Temperature readings of wireless IRTs were compared with
    those from the blackbody, wired IRT, hand-held IRT and thermal imager using linear
    regression analysis. Statistics including root mean square error (RMSE): (3) where
    Oi is the ith measurement, Pi is the ith predicted value, n is the total number
    of data pairs. Root mean square error is the standard deviation of measurements
    and characterizes the reliability of measurements (Taylor, 1997). The mean absolute
    error (MAE): (4) is a statistic that indicates the average magnitude of error
    between the observed and predicted (forecasted) measurement. Its use is preferred
    for small or limited data sets. Finally the mean biased error (MBE) described
    by Mandel (1964): (5) reports the inaccuracy or difference in the sample mean
    or expected value (μ) and the reference value (Ri) for each measurement. This
    equation was used to identify systematic or non-random errors. Standard deviation
    from the mean or the non-negative square root of the variance was used to detect
    variability about the mean for measurements made by a single instrument. Finally,
    since it is not possible to measure the true temperature of an object especially
    in the outdoors, the standard error of the predicted y-value for each x in the
    regression was used to measure the amount of error in the prediction of readings
    from an industrial wired IRT (the predicted values) for an individual reading
    from a wireless IRT (the x value). The equation for the standard error is: (6)
    where y and , x and are the samples and mean for the wired IRT and wireless IRTs,
    respectively, and n is the number of paired samples. The standard error is a measure
    of the amount of error in the prediction of y for an individual x, but for our
    purposes, it was used to evaluate how well measurements from the two instruments
    agreed. 2.3. RF communications RF communications were tested by measuring the
    received signal strength indicator (RSSI, measured in dB) for a sensor node at
    each of five separation distances (7.5 m, 15 m, 30 m, 60 m, and 120 m). Signal
    strength is best measured by sending a number of packets and calculating the percent
    of packets received (Andrade-Sanchez et al., 2007, Hebel et al., 2007, O''Shaughnessy
    and Evett, 2010). At each distance, 25 packets of data were broadcast to the sensor
    node and the percent of successful receptions was recorded. Both the sensor node
    and the modem were enclosed inside of a PVC housing with an XBee series 2 (S2)
    module and whip antenna, Fig. 3. The signal strength of the antenna was equal
    to 1.5 dBi (gain of the antenna referenced to an isotropic source), and positioned
    at 1.5 m above the ground during testing. This is the height at which we typically
    place our IRTs relative to crop canopy height. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    IRT vs. blackbody calibrator The RMSE values calculated between the wireless IRT
    sensor readings and blackbody target temperatures ranged from 0.10 to 0.79 °C
    for measurements made in all ambient temperatures (Table 2). Compared to the standard
    accuracy of the Melexis, reported to be ±0.5 °C, only two of the tested sensors
    (#15 and #16) had a RMSE above 0.5 °C. The significance of a low RMSE value indicates
    a high level of accuracy; 92% of the tested sensors provided accurate temperature
    measurements against the variable blackbody calibrator in changing ambient temperatures.
    The MAE ranged from 0.12 to 1.52 °C for all sensors compared against the blackbody
    calibrator. Again the highest error values were contributed by sensors #15 and
    #16. This error statistic indicates that these two sensors can output an error
    in temperature reading that is 2–3 times greater in magnitude than the other sensors.
    The MBE for twenty sensors ranged from −0.5 to 0.5 °C. These values being relatively
    close to 0.0 °C and within the specifications provided by the manufacturer, imply
    limited bias. On the other hand, the relatively high MBE levels for sensors #15
    (−1.12 °C) and #16 (1.52 °C) suggest systematic errors. Review of the data for
    sensor #15 showed that the IRT readings were consistently higher than the blackbody
    calibrator, while data for sensor #16 indicated that its readings were consistently
    lower than the target. Fig. 4a provides a graphic of both the accuracy [range
    of residual errors, i.e. differences in temperature between the target (TBB) and
    the IRT reading (Tobj)] shown along the ‘y-axis’ for sensor #20. The error residuals
    generally ranged from −0.6 to 0.6 °C regardless of the temperature difference
    between TBB and Tsb shown along the ‘x-axis’; this indicated that the sensor output
    remained relatively accurate when sensor body temperature changed. In contrast,
    the errors in readings from sensor #15 were consistently greater than 0.5 °C whenever
    the Tsb was equal to or greater than TBB; and the majority of the errors were
    negative, Fig. 4b. The negative bias and sources of error may stem from any number
    of issues including imprecision of the temperature compensating chip or problems
    associated with the interface board. Probable examples include electronic noise
    caused by imperfections in the interface circuit that we constructed, heat build-up
    during the operation of the sensor or from the heat given off by the blackbody
    calibrator, or misalignment against the blackbody calibrator target when the sensors
    were tested in batches. Table 2. IRT readings compared against blackbody calibrator.

    image Fig. 4. Comparison of IRT performance between two wireless IRTs showing
    residual errors or differences in blackbody target (TBB) and wireless IRT (Tobj)
    temperature readings across a range of TBB and sensor body (Tsb) temperature differences
    from −40 °C to +40 °C for: (a) sensor #20 having a RMSE = 0.16 °C and MBE = −0.08
    °C; and (b) sensor #15 having a RMSE = 0.59 °C and MBE = −1.12 °C. The simple
    linear regression equation was used to calibrate each sensor and did not include
    sensor body temperature as a variable to adjust the sensor output reading: (7)
    where Y was the measured value of the blackbody target, and mi and bi are the
    customized slope and intercept from the regression. This calibration equation
    reduced the RMSE value in most cases, Table 2. The use of simple linear equations
    is different from those used by Bugbee et al. (1999) where in their studies, the
    slope and intercept were parameterized as a function of Tsb using higher order
    polynomials. Applying the correction techniques of Bugbee et al. (1999) to the
    wireless IRT sensors only slightly increased the RMSE values (data not shown)
    for our sensors. 3.2. Response to temperature transients with and without a heat
    sink When direct radiation was applied to the detector embedded inside of an aluminum
    socket and white PVC sleeve while the blackbody temperature was varied (in different
    ambient temperatures), the detector responded by decreasing voltage output (Vo)
    for the Tobj readings when Tsb was greater than TBB, and increasing Vo when Tsb
    was less than TBB (Fig. 5). In other words, the detector under compensated when
    the sensor body temperature was greater than the blackbody temperature (TBB) and
    overcompensated when the TBB was more than 10 °C greater than Tsb. With the detector
    embedded in the heat sink, the maximum error ranged from −0.8 to 1.5 °C which
    was greater than the manufacturer''s specifications of 0.5 °C under isothermal
    conditions. The MBE was not significantly different when the detector was embedded
    in the aluminum housing (0.08 °C) compared to 0.09 °C when the detector was located
    only in the PVC sleeve. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Error (difference
    between target blackbody temperature (TBB) and IRT temperature reading (Tobj)

    sensor module housed in an aluminum block and inserted in a white PVC sleeve.
    Comparisons were made in ambient temperatures of 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C.
    Further stability testing was performed by investigating the effects of direct
    radiation over a short period of time and under a constant ambient temperature
    near 20 °C with the detector embedded inside of a heat sink and the detector and
    interface circuit board inside of the PVC housing. There was no significant difference
    in Tobj readings (Fig. 6a). While embedded inside of the heat sink, the sensor
    body temperature rose by 4 °C after approximately 30 min (time frame corresponding
    to sampling between 27 and 107 on the horizontal scale) of direct heating. This
    test was repeated four times and the average RMSE between Tobj and the blackbody
    target temperature was 0.04 °C, while the MAE was 0.33 °C. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Reaction of IRT sensor at ambient temperature of 25 °C
    to transitory heat: (a) IRT housed in aluminum block and PVC sleeve, RMSE = 0.04
    °C; and (b) bare IRT sensor exposed directly to heat, RMSE = 0.05 °C. With the
    detector removed from the heat sink but enclosed inside the PVC housing with the
    interfacing circuit board, direct heat was again applied, Tsb rapidly increased
    over a short period of time, however, Tobj readings remained very near to TBB
    (Fig. 6b). The RMSE between Tobj and TBB was 0.05 °C and the MAE was 0.50 °C.
    The stability of the object temperature reading under the influence of direct
    radiation and no heat sink demonstrated that the compensation feature of the sensor
    functioned well to maintain accurate temperature readings relative to TBB and
    that the heat sink did not provide additional benefits. It should be noted that
    in both cases, the Tobj was greater than TBB however the change in Tobj was not
    significant over time and can be corrected using an offset. Realizing that it
    is not possible to measure the true temperature of an object, the next two experiments
    were completed to determine the differences between IRT measurements and those
    from accepted instruments, i.e. readings from a commercial hand-held IRT and an
    industrial IRT. The differences in measurements were not to be considered errors,
    but rather were used to characterize the magnitude of variation among and between
    IRT instruments. 3.3. Hand-held and wireless comparisons Multiple readings taken
    over vegetation and soil at different times of the day allowed us to evaluate
    the precision of the wireless and hand-held IRT. The standard deviation of measurements
    shown for each instrument over each sample type and time period ranged from 0.00
    to 0.08 °C for the Agritherm II and from 0.07 to 0.15 °C for the wireless IRT.
    This indicates that the variability of temperature readings for each instrument
    was small and that the Agritherm II instrument displayed less variability. The
    MAE represents the magnitude of difference between the instruments over the different
    samples and time periods. A difference of less than 1 °C indicates that the measurements
    were in good agreement, Table 3. Table 3. Average and mean difference of temperatures

    times of the day. SD represents one standard deviation from the mean temperature.

    Wired and wireless comparisons This study resulted in paired temperature measurements
    between a wireless and industrial wired IRT over a two-day period in ambient temperatures
    ranging from 10 to 45 °C. The standard error of the predicted reading (the wired
    IRT), for each reading from the wireless IRT was 0.32 °C (07:55–15:42 h) and 0.26
    °C (16:32–02:30 h) on DOY 89–90, and 0.43 °C (07:55–15:42 h) and 0.40 °C (16:32–02:30
    h) when viewing the aluminum block target on DOY 90–91. The relatively low standard
    error values demonstrate that the wireless IRT readings compared well with those
    from the commercial wired IRT, Fig. 7. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    7. Surface temperatures from the wireless IRT and commercial wired IRT. Measurements
    were made on DOY 89, 90, and 91 of 2010 while both sensors were viewing an aluminum
    block. Three thermal images were taken consecutively at 1-min intervals at each
    of four different start times throughout the day. Measurements from both IRTs
    evaluated against the extracted temperatures from the FLIR images were in good
    agreement. Evaluating the accuracy of both IRTs against data from the FLIR camera
    (the predicted value) using the RMSE statistic indicated that the wireless IRT
    (RMSE = 0.55 °C) was closer in value to readings from the thermal images than
    the wired instrument (RMSE = 1.10 °C), Table 4. As the ambient air temperature
    increased, the output of the wired IRT was consistently higher than that of the
    wireless IRT and data extracted from the FLIR image. The temperature drift of
    the wired IRT was indicative of this instrument''s sensitivity to changes in ambient
    air temperature and inability to compensate output readings quickly. In general,
    it is difficult to make concise paired measurements from multiple IRTs even after
    aligning the sensors side-by-side in an outdoor environment due to the numbers
    of variables impacting thermal measurements. The aluminum block was used to minimize
    target variations and improve comparisons between the wired and wireless IRT against
    a large isothermal target of relatively uniform emissivity (in the outdoors).

    38.1 3.5. Radio frequency communication Radio communications for three wireless
    sensors at five different distances from an XBee coordinator, indicated an average
    peak RSSI of 90% (of packets received), at an interval distance of 15 m, Fig.
    8. The RSSI declined as the distance between the sensors and coordinator increased.
    There was a consistent dip in signal strength at the 30 m interval for each sensor
    tested. The reduced communication range at 30 m could not be accounted for with
    the testing that we performed, since the calculated radius of the widest point
    of the Fresnel zone at a distance of 30 m between antennas was 0.94 m, the height
    of the sensors was 1.5 m, and there was no object obstructing the line of the
    sight between the sensor node and coordinator during the testing. However, the
    significant decrease in range at the 120 m interval was expected due the power
    limitations of the RF module. It should also be noted that enclosure of the RF
    antenna inside the PVC housing attenuates the signal strength has reported by
    Darr and Zhao (2008) and O''Shaughnessy and Evett (2010). Download : Download

    at a height of 1.5 m above the ground at separation distances of 7.5, 15, 30,
    60, and 120 m. Each data point represents 5 samples, and the vertical bars represent
    1 standard deviation. 4. Discussion Assessing uncertainties in the output readings
    of these prototype wireless IRTs was important because accurate measurements using
    these instruments are required in research applications. Although it was impossible
    to obtain “true” object temperature readings, a number of comparisons were used
    against instruments with very narrow specifications, and with instruments that
    have accepted temperature readings such as the commercial hand-held IRT and the
    industrial wired IRT. Output readings from the wireless IRTs may have been affected
    by imperfections in the interface board. Flaws may be detected by measuring the
    resistance of each component without power to the board and then measuring voltages
    at specific points and comparing the readings to expected values when the board
    is powered. If excessive heat build-up occurs during the transmission of data
    (period of highest current draw) and if it impacts the temperature of the IR detector,
    then it may be possible to limit the heat build-up by troubleshooting for imperfections
    that are the cause of high impedance, increasing the size of the power traces
    on the interface board, reviewing the dissipation and efficiency factors of various
    board components and replacing them with better performing parts, and limiting
    the length of transmission periods. Overall, the low RMSE values calculated for
    the majority of sensors indicated that the detector''s temperature compensation
    algorithm worked well. If built-in temperature compensation is not adequate, then
    the methods of calibration provided by Kalma et al. (1988) may need to be applied.
    It should be noted that the communication evaluation of the wireless sensors was
    very limited in scope, but the communication range of these IRTs can be improved
    by substituting a RF module with an external dipole antenna (greater gain) or
    by increasing the size of the antenna at the coordinator when established within
    a wireless sensor network. Additionally when working with mesh-type wireless sensor
    networks, the number of sensors in a network and the placement of repeaters can
    also impact the reliability and range of data communication. 5. Conclusions This
    study evaluated the performance of prototype narrow FOV wireless IRTs against
    a blackbody calibrator and measurements from hand-held and wired infrared thermometers.
    An increase in the availability of narrow FOV wireless IRTs could alleviate challenges
    for agricultural researchers who are utilizing infrared thermometry to effectively
    quantify crop water stress and provide instrumentation useful to precision agricultural
    applications. Surface temperature readings from the wireless IRTs compared well
    in indoor and outdoor environments, and over soil and vegetation samples. Low
    RMSE and MAE values indicate that the manufacturer''s applied signal conditioning
    method mitigated the issue of temperature drift under the tested conditions. There
    was no apparent advantage to using the aluminum socket for purposes of sensor
    body temperature stabilization which is important in designing suitable and economical
    housing. Although accuracy is not easy to obtain in outdoor conditions, the comparisons
    reported by this manuscript indicated that the readings from these prototypes
    will provide adequate monitoring of crop canopy temperature when positioned on
    a pivot lateral. However, because PVC housing does not completely isolate the
    IRT element from changes in ambient air temperature or heating that may be produced
    by the electronic components on the circuit board, additional testing of the wireless
    sensor modules in an outdoor setting is necessary to investigate the consistency
    and accuracy of long term object temperature readings, especially when the difference
    between sensor body and object temperature is greater than 10 °C. Acknowledgements

  limitations: The study acknowledges that the evaluation of RF signal strength of
    the sensor module was very limited in scope and that the communication range of
    these IRTs can be improved by substituting a RF module with an external dipole
    antenna (greater gain) or by increasing the size of the antenna at the coordinator
    when established within a wireless sensor network. Additionally, when working
    with mesh-type wireless sensor networks, the number of sensors in a network and
    the placement of repeaters can also impact the reliability and range of data communication.

    \ professionals because these small pieces of ―smart dust‖ offer \ngreat advantages\
    \ due to their small size, low power consumption, easy integration and \nsupport\
    \ for ―green‖ applications. Green applications are considered a hot topic in \n\
    intelligent environments, ubiquitous and pervasive computing. This work evaluates\
    \ a new \nwireless sensor network platform and its application in precision agriculture,\
    \ including its \nembedded operating system and its routing algorithm. To validate\

    \ of LORA-CBF, a wireless location-based routing algorithm that uses \ncluster-based\
    \ flooding. Cluster-based flooding addresses the scalability concerns of \nwireless\
    \ sensor networks, while the modified LORA-CBF routing algorithm includes a \n\

    \ \nAgricultural production represents a strategic sector of any national economy.\
    \ This is particularly \ntrue in Latin American countries, where traditionally\
    \ a large percentage of the population is rural and \ndepends on traditional agricultural\
    \ production to live. Efficiently monitoring crops is critical because it \nsignificantly\
    \ increases production, rationalizes the use of water and other consumables, and\
    \ produces \nvalue-added crops [1]. However, crop monitoring can sometimes present\
    \ technological difficulties, \nthus increasing operational costs and maintenance.\
    \ The cost and maintenance of complex systems \noften exceeds what smaller farmers\
    \ can invest. Smaller producers in developing countries cannot \nexploit the benefits\
    \ of a scale economy. Unfortunately, because smaller, traditional producers often\
    \ \ncannot compete, they abandon their fields seeking improved economic opportunities\
    \ in the cities. In \nLatin America countries, approximately 40% of the population\
    \ has migrated from rural to urban \nsettings either in their own countries or\
    \ abroad [2]. This migratory trend has resulted in decreased \nagricultural production\
    \ and increased agricultural imports, leading to increased trade deficits and\
    \ \nforeign dependency on foreign sources, both of which can contribute to making\
    \ basic products difficult \nto acquire [3]. \nMexico is not an exception to Latin\
    \ American trends regarding its agricultural sector. The \nmodernization of farming\
    \ practices and the use of technology in Mexico‘s fields has been at the center\
    \ \nof great debate. Because most of Mexico‘s land is not suitable for traditional\
    \ agriculture, \nmodernization of agricultural practices and the principle of\
    \ competitive advantage infer a transition, in \npart, to non-traditional crops\
    \ cultivated with emerging technologies, including wireless technologies, \nsuch\
    \ as sensors and actuators. This automation may not only significantly improve\
    \ production and \ncrop quality, but more efficiently use often scarce natural\
    \ resources such as soil and water.  \nPrecision agriculture techniques, whose\
    \ objective is to efficiently use consumables such as \nfertilizers, pesticides,\
    \ soil, and water, among others, can be applied in both open and closed spaces.\
    \ An \nadditional advantage of precision agriculture techniques is that they can\
    \ reduce the use of dangerous \nagricultural products that contaminate the environment.\
    \ Precision agriculture traditionally involves \nglobal positioning (GPS) to help\
    \ identify problems related to ground monitoring, insect pests, humidity \nand\
    \ crop density, among others. Present satellite technology and image analysis,\
    \ however, can be \nrather costly and imprecise, as many problems are too small\
    \ to be detected by satellite imagery. \nSustainable agricultural practices emphasize\
    \ the development of biotechnology, techniques to \nincrease crop production,\
    \ and the application of technology to agricultural production, among others.\
    \ \nHowever, these practices make applying state-of-the-art technology in many\
    \ parts of the world \ndifficult to achieve. Expanding the role of technology\
    \ to monitor and control crops and otherwise \nautomate agricultural practices\
    \ is essential to decrease costs and provide benefits to a greater \npercentage\
    \ of producers worldwide. Precision agriculture, comprised of sensors, wireless\
    \ networks, \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \
    \ \n \n \n1194 \ncomputer hardware, software applications, and wireless communication\
    \ technologies can significantly \nreduce the time a producer requires to make\
    \ important decisions related to resource management, \nplanning, administration,\
    \ process analysis and evaluation, which ultimately contribute to improved \n\
    decision making. \nPresently, the agricultural sector does not sufficiently employ\
    \ technology and informatics to modify \nproduction practices. Although progress\
    \ is being made with regards to the deployment of sensors, \nwireless networks,\
    \ actuators and other electromechanical devices in agricultural settings, there\
    \ are still \nimportant areas of development that have not been sufficiently explored.\
    \ The digital divide also affects \nagricultural practices in developing countries,\
    \ as many current innovations have not yet ―filtered \ndown‖. Embedded systems\
    \ and wireless technologies can, in the long run, reduce costs and increase \n\
    profits in countries with favorable year-round climates that permit multiple harvests\
    \ but lack other \nessentials required to maximize their potential.  \nAdvances\
    \ in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology have made the deployment\
    \ of \nwireless sensor nodes a reality, in part, because they are small, inexpensive\
    \ and energy efficient. Each \nnode of a sensor network consists of three basic\
    \ subsystems: a sensor subsystem to monitor local \nenvironmental parameters,\
    \ a processing subsystem to provide computational support to the node, and a \n\
    communication subsystem to provide wireless communications to exchange information\
    \ with \nneighboring nodes. Because individual sensor nodes can only cover a relatively\
    \ limited area, they need \nto be connected to one another in a coordinated manner\
    \ to form a wireless sensor network (WSN), \nwhich can provide large amounts of\
    \ detailed information about a given geographic area. Consequently, \na wireless\
    \ sensor network can be described as a collection of intercommunicated wireless\
    \ sensor nodes \nwhich coordinate to perform a specific action. Unlike traditional\
    \ wireless networks, WSNs depend on \ndense deployment and coordination to carry\
    \ out their task. Wireless sensor nodes measure conditions \nin the environment\
    \ surrounding them and then transform these measurements into signals that can\
    \ be \nprocessed to reveal specific information about phenomena located within\
    \ the coverage area \nsurrounding these sensor nodes. \nHowever, the imperative\
    \ necessity to control physical variables such as temperature, relative \nhumidity,\
    \ soil moisture, etc., has led to the development of wireless sensor and actor\
    \ networks \n(WSANs), which are commonly composed of heterogeneous devices referred\
    \ to as sensors and \nactuators. Sensors are low-cost low-power multi-functional\
    \ devices that communicate wirelessly for \nshort distances. Actuators are usually\
    \ resource-rich devices with greater processing capabilities, higher \ntransmission\
    \ capabilities, and longer battery life. Actuators collect and process sensor\
    \ data and \nperform specific actions within a specified environment based on\
    \ the information they receive.  \nFuture applications will extensively employ\
    \ wireless sensor networks that function in real time in \nconjunction with communications\
    \ systems, mechanical actuators, and even robots to monitor and \nintervene in\
    \ crop cultivation. A wireless sensors network (WSN) permits remote monitoring\
    \ of many \nparameters, depending on the type of sensors used and the coverage\
    \ area. This type of network consists \nof a large number of sensor nodes that\
    \ are wirelessly connected to each other, to electromechanical \ndevices, and\
    \ to a communications network, all of which form a triad to monitor and control\
    \ crop \ndevelopment. Generally, each node of a WSN consists of sensors and/or\
    \ actuators. Sensors are \ncharacterized by their limited memory and computation\
    \ capacities, but one advantage of sensors is that \nthey require little power\
    \ to perform their functions. Wireless sensor networks consisting of many \nSensors\
    \ 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n1195 \nnodes\
    \ are currently being used in densely populated large scale areas. WSNs can have\
    \ homogenous \nstructures, where all nodes present similar characteristics, or\
    \ heterogeneous structures, where some \nnodes are more powerful than others or\
    \ are differentiated by physical characteristics, including the \ntype of battery\
    \ or antenna the individual nodes use, or whether specific nodes are static or\
    \ dynamic. \nWSNs have a variety of applications. Examples include environmental\
    \ monitoring—which involves \nmonitoring air, soil and water, condition-based\
    \ maintenance, habitat monitoring, seismic detection, \nmilitary surveillance,\
    \ inventory tracking, smart spaces, etc. [4,5]. Despite their many diverse \n\
    applications, WSNs pose a number of unique technical challenges because of fault\
    \ tolerance \n(robustness), scalability, production costs, operating environment,\
    \ sensor network topology, hardware \nconstraints, transmission media and power\
    \ consumption. \nIn this work, we selected a 100-meter row of watermelons in a\
    \ 6-hectare field, where we placed \nsensors linearly at 5-meter intervals. Watermelons\
    \ were chosen as the crop for study because they \nrequire a specific temperature\
    \ and humidity to optimally ripen. However, our proposed technological \nplatform\
    \ can also be applied in other precision agriculture applications because it incorporates\
    \ a \nmodified version of LORA-CBF, a wireless location-based routing algorithm\
    \ that uses cluster-based \nflooding, which, as mentioned previously, addresses\
    \ the scalability concerns of wireless sensor \nnetworks, including monitoring\
    \ of residual battery energy. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\
    \ Section 2 classifies routing algorithms and \ntheir application in wireless\
    \ sensor networks. Section 3 describes the technological platform for \nwireless\
    \ sensor nodes. Section 4 reviews the proposed hierarchical and flat algorithms\
    \ for our wireless \nsensor network. Section 5 explains the system evaluation.\
    \ Section 6 describes the evaluated scenario \nand the results obtained from the\
    \ small-scale network and Section 7 summarizes our work and \nproposes future\
    \ research. \n2. Routing Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks \nRouting protocols\
    \ for wireless sensor networks can be classified as data-centric, hierarchical\
    \ or \nlocation-based. \n2.1. Data-Centric Protocols (Flat Architecture) \nIn\
    \ data-centric protocols, the sensor nodes broadcast an advertisement for the\
    \ available data and \nwait for a request from an interested sink. Flooding is\
    \ a simple technique that can be used to broadcast \ninformation in wireless sensor\
    \ networks. However, it requires significant resources because each node \nreceiving\
    \ a message must rebroadcast it, unless a maximum number of hops for the packet\
    \ are reached, \nor the destination of the packet is the node itself. Flooding\
    \ is a reactive technique that does not require \ncostly topology maintenance\
    \ or complex route discovery algorithms. However, it does have several \nadditional\
    \ deficiencies, including implosion, overlap and resource blindness [6]. A derivation\
    \ of \nflooding is gossiping, in which nodes do not broadcast. Instead, they send\
    \ the incoming packets to a \nrandomly selected neighbor.  \nSensor protocols\
    \ for information via negotiation (SPIN) address the deficiencies of classic flooding\
    \ \nby providing negotiation and resource adaptation [7]. However, the SPIN data\
    \ advertisement \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \
    \     \n \n \n1196 \nmechanism cannot, by itself, guarantee data delivery [8].\
    \ SPIN employs a shortest path strategy based \non three types of messages to\
    \ communicate: \nADV—new data advertisement. When a SPIN node has data to share,\
    \ it can advertise this fact by \ntransmitting an ADV message containing meta-data.\
    \ \nREQ—request for data. A SPIN node sends a REQ message when it wishes to receive\
    \ some  \nactual data. \nDATA—data message. A DATA messages contains actual sensor\
    \ data with a meta-data header. \nUnlike traditional networks, a sensor node does\
    \ not necessarily require an identity (e.g., an \naddress). Instead, applications\
    \ focus on the different data generated by the sensors. Because data is \nidentified\
    \ by its attributes, applications request data matching certain attribute values.\
    \ One of the most \npopular algorithms for data-centric protocols is direct diffusion,\
    \ which bases its routing strategy on a \nshortest path strategy [9]. A sensor\
    \ network based on direct diffusion exhibits the following properties: \neach\
    \ sensor node names the data it generates with one or more attributes, other nodes\
    \ may express \ninterest based on these attributes, and network nodes propagate\
    \ interests. Interests establish gradients \nthat direct the diffusion of data.\
    \ In its simple form, a gradient is a scalar quantity. Negative gradients \ninhibit\
    \ the distribution of data along a particular path, and positive gradients encourage\
    \ the \ntransmission of data along the path. \nThe Energy-Aware Routing protocol\
    \ is a destination-initiated reactive protocol that increases \nnetwork lifetime\
    \ by using a single path at all times, which is very similar to source routing\
    \ [10]. \nRumor routing [11] is a variation of direct diffusion that is mainly\
    \ intended for applications where \ngeographic routing is not feasible. Gradient-based\
    \ routing is another variant of direct diffusion [12]. \nThe key idea of gradient-based\
    \ routing is to memorize the number of hops when the interest is diffused \nthroughout\
    \ the network. Constraint Anisotropic Diffusion Routing (CADR) is a general form\
    \ of direct \ndiffusion [13] and lastly, Active Query Forwarding in Sensor Networks\
    \ (ACQUIRE) [14] views the \nnetwork as a distributed database, where complex\
    \ queries can be further divided into several  \nsub queries. \nThe XMesh Routing\
    \ Protocol is a multi-hop routing protocol developed by Crossbow to run on the\
    \ \nMICA and eKo families of motes [15]. In the XMesh routing protocol the cost\
    \ metric minimizes the \ntotal number of transmissions required to deliver a packet\
    \ over multiple hops to a destination and is \ntermed Minimum Transmission (MT)\
    \ cost metric. This differs from the traditional cost metric of \ndistance vector\
    \ routing which is hop count. The multi-hop network is initially formed when motes\
    \ \nbroadcast periodic beacon messages to all other motes within radio range.\
    \ When the beacon messages \nare sent, they contain a cost value, which indicates\
    \ the energy required to transmit a message from the \nmotes to the base station.\
    \ Higher cost indicates that more energy is required to transmit.  \n2.2. Hierarchical\
    \ Protocols \nHierarchical protocols are based on clusters because clusters contribute\
    \ to more scalable behavior \nas the number of nodes increases. Furthermore, clusters\
    \ provide improved robustness and facilitate \nmore efficient resource utilization\
    \ for many distributed sensor coordination tasks.  \nLow-Energy Adaptive Clustering\
    \ Hierarchy (LEACH) is a cluster-based protocol that minimizes \nenergy dissipation\
    \ in sensor networks by randomly selecting sensor nodes as cluster-heads [16].\
    \ \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n1197\
    \ \nPower-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information System (PEGASIS) [17] is a\
    \ near optimal  \nchain-based protocol. The basic idea of the protocol is to extend\
    \ network lifetime by allowing nodes to \ncommunicate exclusively with their closest\
    \ neighbors, employing a turn-taking strategy to \ncommunicate with the Base Station\
    \ (BS). Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient protocol (TEEN) [18] \nand Adaptive\
    \ Periodic TEEN (APTEEN) [19] have also been proposed for time-critical applications.\
    \ \nIn TEEN, sensor nodes continuously sense the medium, but data transmission\
    \ is done less frequently. \nAPTEEN, on the other hand, is a hybrid protocol that\
    \ changes the periodicity or threshold values used \nin the TEEN protocol, according\
    \ to user needs and the application type. \n2.3. Location-Based Protocols \nLocation-based\
    \ protocols make use of position information to relay data to the desired regions,\
    \ \ninstead of the entire network. Before a packet can be sent, the position of\
    \ the destination must first be \ndetermined. Typically, a location service is\
    \ responsible for this task. Existing location services can be \nclassified according\
    \ to how many nodes host the service. This can be either a specific node or all\
    \ of the \nnetwork nodes. Furthermore, each location server may maintain the position\
    \ of a specific node or all \nthe nodes in the network.  \nIn position-based routing,\
    \ a node‘s forwarding decision is primarily based on the position of a \npacket‘s\
    \ destination and the position of its immediate one-hop neighbor. The position\
    \ of the \ndestination is contained in the header of the packet. If a node has\
    \ a more accurate position of the \ndestination, it may choose to update the position\
    \ in the packet before forwarding it. The position of the \nneighbors is typically\
    \ learned through a one-hop broadcast beacon. These beacons are sent periodically\
    \ \nby all nodes and contain the position of the sending node. \nWe can distinguish\
    \ three main packet-forwarding strategies for position-based routing: greedy \n\
    forwarding, restricted directional flooding, and hierarchical approaches. For\
    \ the first two, a node \nforwards a given packet to one (greedy forwarding) or\
    \ more (restricted directional flooding) one-hop \nneighbors that are located\
    \ closer to the destination than the forwarding node itself. The selection of\
    \ the \nneighbor in the greedy case depends on the optimization criteria of the\
    \ algorithm. The third forwarding \nstrategy is to form a hierarchy in order to\
    \ scale to a large number of mobile nodes.  \nMinimum Energy Communication Network\
    \ (MECN) [20] establishes and maintains a minimum \nenergy network for wireless\
    \ networks by utilizing low-power geographic positioning system (GPS). \nThe main\
    \ idea of MECN is to find the sub-network with the smallest number of nodes that\
    \ requires the \nleast transmission power between any two particular nodes (shortest\
    \ path). The Small Minimum \nEnergy Communication Network (SMECN) [21] is an extension\
    \ of MECN. The major drawback of \nMECN is that it assumes that every node can\
    \ transmit to every other node, which is not always \npossible. One advantage\
    \ of SMECN is that it considers obstacles between pairs of nodes. Geographic \n\
    Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) [22] is an energy-aware location-based routing algorithm\
    \ primarily designed \nfor ad-hoc networks that can also be applied to sensor\
    \ networks. GAF conserves energy by turning off \nunnecessary nodes in the network\
    \ without affecting the level of routing fidelity. Finally, Geographic \nand Energy\
    \ Aware Routing [23] uses energy-awareness and geographically informed neighbor\
    \ \nselection heuristics to route a packet toward the destination region. \nSensors\

    \ Platform for the Wireless Sensor Node \nThe design of the agricultural platform\
    \ system faced three significant challenges: building a \nsufficiently lightweight,\
    \ energy efficient hardware capable of monitoring and control physical \nvariables;\
    \ incorporating and evaluating different operating systems and algorithms into\
    \ a software to \nachieve autonomous transfer sensing and control variables; and\
    \ integrating subsystems such as \nmicroprocessor, sensors and actuator modules\
    \ and wireless networking into a fully functional wireless \nplatform solution.\
    \ \n3.1. ARM System and Wireless Radio Networking \nThis section provides an overview\
    \ of the ARM microcontroller systems, focusing on the LPC2148F \nmodel of the\
    \ LPC2000 family. Table 1 provides a summary of the LPC2148F hardware and a picture\
    \ \nand the block diagram of the wireless sensor node is shown in Figure 1.  \n\

    \ where the S \nmeans that it has a synthesized VHDL core. For a more in depth\
    \ description of the LPC2148F system, \nthe following references should be consulted\
    \ [25-27]. The agricultural platform is equipped  \nwith 802.15.4 compliant radios,\
    \ namely the XBEE Pro Zigbee radios from Maxstream. These radios \nwere chosen\
    \ due to their combination of lightweight, long transmission range, serial interface\
    \ \ncompatibility with the ARM processor, and packet interface. As shown in Figure\
    \ 1, the small size of \nthe agricultural platform designed at the SITELDI Solutions\
    \ Laboratory possesses the advantages of \nbeing inexpensive, energy efficient\
    \ and highly resistant in outdoor environments.  \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n \

    \ Operating System Design \nIn this section, we describe the architecture of the\
    \ PaRTiKle operating system, which adheres to a \nclassical layered multi threaded\
    \ design, as shown in Figure 2.  \nFigure 2. PaRTiKle OS Architecture. \n \n \n\
    PaRTiKle [28,29] is a new embedded real-time operating system designed to be as\
    \ compatible with \nthe POSIX.51 standard as possible. The native API consists\
    \ of ―C‖ POSIX threads and provides \nsupport for C++, Ada and Java (tasking,\
    \ synchronization, protected objects, exception handling, etc.). \nPaRTiKle has\
    \ been designed to support applications with real-time requirements, providing\
    \ features \nsuch as full preemptability, minimal interrupt latencies, and all\
    \ the necessary synchronization \nprimitives, scheduling policies, and interrupt\
    \ handling mechanisms needed for these types of \napplications. To meet the application\
    \ requirements of sensor networks, the PaRTiKle OS implements a \nlightweight\
    \ and energy-efficient scheduler, a user-level network stack, as well as other\
    \ components \nsuch as device drivers all this in less than 12 Kbytes code lines.\
    \ A layered network stack and hardware \ndriver system is included to simplifying\
    \ communication in an embedded platform. The PaRTiKle OS \nitself is coded mostly\
    \ in C, and it presents a simplified C POSIX.51 standard programming interface.\
    \ \nAn application developer may write the application code in standard ANSI C\
    \ and compile it with gcc, \navoiding the need to learn a specialized language\
    \ or compiler. PaRTikle‘s structure provides several \nadvantages over existing\
    \ sensor network systems because it: \n is portable, configurable and maintainable\
    \  \n supports multiple execution environments. This allows it to execute the\
    \ same application \ncode (without any modification) under different environments.\
    \ Presently, it can be used in a \nbare machine and to facilitate application\
    \ development. It also runs as a Linux regular \nprocess and as a hypervisor domain,\
    \ increasing the number of devices that can participate in \na PaRTiKle network.\
    \ \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n1200\
    \ \n supports multiple programming languages. PaRTiKle currently supports Ada,\
    \ C, C++, and \nJava (the current support of this last language is only supported\
    \ when the 4.2 GCC compiler \nis used). \n supports a great deal of existing\
    \ code. A significant amount of open-source code can be \nported to PaRTiKle OS.\
    \ \n3.2.1. PaRTiKle Architecture \nFigure 2 sketches the PaRTiKle architecture.\
    \ Contrary to other small embedded RTOS, which are \nimplemented as a library\
    \ that is linked to the application, PaRTiKle has been designed as a real kernel\
    \ \nwith a clean and well-defined separation between the kernel and application\
    \ execution spaces. All \nkernel services are provided via a single entry_point,\
    \ which improves the robustness and simplifies \nporting PaRTiKle to other architectures\
    \ and environments. \n3.2.2. Execution Environments \nPaRTiKle has been designed\
    \ to run under several different execution environments. There are \npresently\
    \ three different execution environments are available, all of them for the ARM\
    \ and x86 \narchitecture: (1) on a bare machine, (2) as a Linux regular process\
    \ and (3) as a domain of  \nXtratuM [30,31]. This last alternative provides the\
    \ possibility of executing PaRTiKle jointly with \nanother general purpose operating\
    \ system (Linux so far).  \n On a bare machine: PaRTiKle is the only system executed\
    \ and is in charge of managing  \nall of the hardware. This environment is the\
    \ best option for applications with  \nreal-time constraints. \n As a Linux regular\
    \ process: This environment is intended for testing purposes and the \ngenerated\
    \ code is executed as a regular Linux process. PaRTiKle still has direct access\
    \ to \nthe hardware; however, real-time constraints are not guaranteed. \n As\
    \ an XtratuM domain: XtratuM is a hypervisor that provides hardware virtualization\
    \ and \nenables the execution of several kernels (or run-times) concurrently.\
    \ PaRTiKle can be built \nto be XtratuM aware and then loaded using the XtratuM.\
    \ \n4. Proposed Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks \nLocation Routing\
    \ Algorithm with Cluster-Based Flooding (LORA_CBF) [32] was developed by the \n\
    principal author of this work, and was modified to meet the requirements of precision\
    \  \nagriculture applications.  \nLORA-CBF is formed with one cluster-head, zero\
    \ or more members in every cluster and one or \nmore gateways to communicate with\
    \ other cluster-heads. Each cluster-head maintains a ―Cluster \nTable.‖ A ―Cluster\
    \ Table‖ is defined as a table that contains the addresses and status of neighbor\
    \ \nnodes. A node in LORA-CBF can be in any of the following four states: \n\
    \ Undecided: A node is in this transitional state when it is in search of a cluster-head.\
    \ Nodes \nare initially undecided when they enter the network or when they wake\
    \ up. \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n\
    \ \n1201 \n Member: A node that is a member of any cluster assigned to a cluster-head.\
    \ A member in \nLORA-CBF cannot retransmit a search packet. \n Cluster-head:\
    \ A node that is responsible for all the nodes in its cluster. The cluster-head\
    \ is \nresponsible for periodically transmitting Hello messages. The cluster-head\
    \ also maintains \nthe cluster table of the member and gateway nodes in its cluster.\
    \ \n Gateway: A node that is member of at least two cluster-heads that can be\
    \ used for \ncommunication between clusters. \n4.1. Cluster Formation \nTo enable\
    \ cluster formation and maintenance, all nodes keep the information about their\
    \ neighbors \nin their neighbor table. Let t be the period of time between the\
    \ Hello broadcasts. When a node first \nswitches on, it first listens to Hello\
    \ packets on the broadcast channel. If any other node on the \nbroadcast channel\
    \ is already advertising itself as a cluster-head (status of node = cluster-head),\
    \ the new \nnode saves the heard cluster-head ID in its cluster-head ID field\
    \ and changes its status to member. At \nany point in time, a node in the mobile\
    \ network associates itself with a cluster-head. The cluster-heads \nare identified\
    \ by the cluster-head ID. Otherwise, the new node becomes cluster-head. The cluster-head\
    \ \nis responsible for the cluster and periodically sends a Hello Message.  \n\

    \ member receives a Hello message, it registers the cluster-head and responds\
    \ with a \nreply Hello message. The cluster-head then updates the Cluster Table\
    \ with the address and status of \nevery member in the cluster. When a member\
    \ receives a Hello packet from a different cluster-head, it \nfirst registers\
    \ the cluster-head, but the member does not modify its cluster-head ID until the\
    \ expiration \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \
    \  \n \n \n1202 \ntime for the field has expired. Before the member rebroadcasts\
    \ the new information, it changes its \nstatus to a gateway. After receiving the\
    \ Hello packet, the cluster-heads update the Cluster Table with \nthe information\
    \ about the new gateway.  \nStrategy for Gateway forwarding \nIf (Packet_received)\

    if (know_sink) Send_packet_sink() \n \n \n \nelse Relay_packet_s() \nelse Lora_cbf()\
    \ \nIf the cluster-head source wants to send a message to the sink, it first checks\
    \ its routing table to \ndetermine if it has a ―fresh‖ route to the sink. If it\
    \ does, it first seeks its Cluster Table to determine the \nclosest neighbor to\
    \ the sink. Otherwise, it starts the discovery process. \n4.2. Routing Strategy\
    \ for Hierarchical Architecture \nWhen a node wants to send a packet to the sink,\
    \ it sends a packet ―d‖ (discovery) to its cluster head \n(Figure 3). \nFigure\

    \ \n \n \n         \n \n \n1203 \nThe cluster head source seeks the route in its\
    \ routing table. If it has the route, the cluster head \nsource sends a packet\
    \ ―r‖ (route) to the sink. Otherwise, the cluster head source sends a package\
    \ ―s‖ \n(search) to search for a route to the sink. After this, the sink receives\
    \ an ―s‖ package and it replies to \nthe cluster head source by sending a ―t‖\
    \ (target) packet that leads to the cluster head source as the \ntarget that generated\
    \ the ―s‖ package. This package contains the path to the sink. However, if the\
    \ route \nto the sink becomes invalid, the cluster head source generates an ―f‖\
    \ (fail) package indicating that it \nwas not possible to reach the sink, and\
    \ rebuilds a package ―s‖ to find a new route to the sink.  \n4.3. Routing Strategy\
    \ for Flat Architecture \nWhen a node has data to transmit to the sink, it sends\
    \ a broadcast message to the nodes that are \nwithin its coverage area to create\
    \ a temporary table with the energy and number of hops needed to \nreach the sink.\
    \ In the Figure 4, the node possessing the most energy and the requiring the smallest\
    \ \nnumber of hops to the sink is chosen to send the data packet. This process\
    \ is repeated until the data \npacket reaches the sink. If a data packet fails\
    \ to reach the sink, this process is repeated, beginning at \nthe source, until\
    \ it successfully reaches the sink.  \nFigure 4. Routing Strategy for flat architecture.\

    \ \n \n1204 \n5. System Evaluation \nThe following metrics were used to evaluate\
    \ the LORA-CBF algorithm in a hierarchical and a  \nflat architecture.  \n Route\
    \ discovery time (latency): the amount of time the source has to wait before sending\
    \ the \nfirst data packet.  \n Packet delivery ratio: the ratio of the number\
    \ of data packets delivered to the destination and \nthe number of data packets\
    \ sent by the sender. Data packets may be dropped en route \nexclusively if the\
    \ next hop link is broken at the moment the data packet is ready to be transmitted.\
    \ \n Average end-to-end delay of data packets: all of the possible delays caused\
    \ by buffering during \nroute discovery, queuing at the interface queue, re-transmission\
    \ delays at the MAC, and \npropagation and transfer times. \n Throughput: the\
    \ average rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel. \n\
     Routing load: the routing packets transmitted per data packet transmitted. This\
    \ provides an idea \nof network bandwidth consumed by routing packets with respect\
    \ to ‗useful‘ data packets. \n Overhead (packets): the total number of routing\
    \ packets that are generated divided by the total \nnumber of data packets transmitted,\
    \ plus the number total routing packets. \nIn the Figure 5, the red line represents\
    \ the hierarchical architecture and the blue line the flat \narchitecture. Figure\
    \ 5(a) shows that the latency of the flat algorithm increases linearly in proportion\
    \ to \nthe number of hops. On the other hand, the latency of the hierarchical\
    \ algorithm increases irregularly \nbecause of its group formation mechanism.\
    \ However, it is important to note that regardless of whether \nthe algorithm\
    \ is flat or hierarchical, latency increases proportionally to the number of hops.\
    \ Figure 5(b) \nshows the Packet delivery ratio. In this scenario, both the flat\
    \ and hierarchical algorithms behave the \nsame. Figure 5(c) shows that End-to-End\
    \ delay increases proportionally for both algorithms, although \nthe flat algorithm‘s\
    \ End-to-End delay increases linearly while the hierarchical algorithm‘s increase\
    \ in \nEnd-to-End delay is more irregular due to its group formation mechanism.\
    \ This mechanism \nsubstantially increases End-to-End delay. Figure 5(d) represents\
    \ the throughput which is significantly \nbetter in the hierarchical algorithm\
    \ because of its superior packet transmission mechanism, which \nsubstantially\
    \ reduces the possibility of collisions. Figure 5(e) shows the routing load. The\
    \ flat \nalgorithm performs better than the hierarchical algorithm with regards\
    \ routing load because it does not \nhave a group formation mechanism that can\
    \ increase packet transmission. Figure 5(f) shows overhead \n(packets) which is\
    \ the total number of routing packets that are generated divided by the total\
    \ number of \ndata packets transmitted, plus the number total routing packets.\
    \ Again, the flat routing algorithm \nperforms better than the hierarchical algorithm\
    \ with regards to overhead. \nIn summary, the hierarchical architecture adds more\
    \ delay in terms of route discovery time,  \nEnd-to-End delay, routing load and\
    \ overhead, but it significantly improves throughput. The main \nadvantage of\
    \ using the hierarchical architecture vs. the flat architecture is network scalability.\
    \ The \nhierarchical architecture is more scalable and can handle a greater number\
    \ of nodes.  \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \

    \ 6 was used to evaluate the proposed routing algorithms. Five wireless sensor\
    \ \nnodes were employed to represent a small-scale network. Node N2 represents\
    \ the node which starts the \nrouting process.  \nThe wireless sensor network\
    \ consisted of 20 sensors that were placed linearly at 5 meter intervals. \nThe\
    \ position of the four wireless sensor nodes is shown in Figure 6. The temperature\
    \ and humidity \nsensors were placed on wooden rods placed in the soil. We chose\
    \ to place the nodes in this way \nbecause we wanted the average air temperature\
    \ and humidity at the intermediate height between the \nplants. The soil moisture\
    \ and temperature sensors were placed approximately 5 cm from each other at \n\
    each 5-meter interval. The sensors were then placed just in the soil a few millimeters\
    \ below the actual \nground level.  \nSensors 2011, 11 \n \n \n          \n \n\

    Each wireless sensor node has four ports, so we connected three soil moisture\
    \ and temperature \nsensors and one humidity and temperature sensor per wireless\
    \ sensor node sensing each one of the \nvariables every hour. The wireless sensor\
    \ network was deployed on Monday 13/12/2010 at 13:00, \napproximately, and was\
    \ recovered on Wednesday 15/12/2010 at 12:00. \nResults Obtained from the Small-Scale\
    \ Network \nFigure 7(a) shows the ambient temperature in degrees Celsius. The\
    \ wireless sensor network was \ndeployed at 13:00 on Monday in a field as shown\
    \ in Figure 6. On Monday, the temperature  \nreached 33 °C and on Tuesday, the\
    \ temperature reached 32 °C between 13:00 and 15:00 P. M. The \nprimary difference\
    \ between the two days was the greater cloud density on Tuesday. However, the\
    \ \nminimum temperature was the same on both days reaching a nightly low of 16\
    \ °C. Figure 7(b) \nprovides the relative humidity experienced on both days. The\
    \ maximum relative humidity reached  \nwas 95 (Relative Humidity Index, RHI),\
    \ which is a typical outdoor field environment in this region. \nThe minimum relative\
    \ humidity was 40 RHI on Monday, which increased to 50 RHI on Tuesday \nbecause\
    \ of the increased cloudiness that day. This difference, however, allows us to\
    \ infer that RHI \nincreases with exposure to sunlight. Figure 7(c) shows the\
    \ soil temperature. Similarly to the ambient \ntemperature, the soil temperatures\
    \ were slightly affected by the cloud density on Monday. The \nmaximum temperature\
    \ of 28 °C was reached between 13:00 and 15:00 hours on Monday and a \ntemperature\
    \ of 27 °C between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday. The minimum temperature was 17\
    \ °C for \nboth days. Figure 7(d) presents soil moisture results. The soil moisture\
    \ results differ significantly from \nplant to plant because the plants are irrigated\
    \ manually using traditional methods. Consequently, the \nwater is not distributed\
    \ uniformly among the plants and causes different soil moistures, depending on\
    \ \nthe irrigation time and actual water flow each plant receives.  \nSensors\

    \ its embedded operating system \nand its routing algorithm was evaluated in terms\
    \ of route discovery time, packet delivery ratio,  \nEnd-to-End delay, Throughput,\
    \ routing load and overhead. A flat and hierarchical algorithm was \nevaluated\
    \ in a small-scale network under test bed conditions in a watermelon field. The\
    \ flat algorithm \nproved to be superior with regards to route discovery time,\
    \ End-to-End delay, and routing load and \noverhead. The hierarchical algorithm\
    \ proved to be superior regarding Throughput and scalability. In \nsmall-scale\
    \ network applications, we found that the flat algorithm is more suitable because\
    \ of its \nsimplicity. Results show that LORA_CBF is suitable for both flat and\
    \ hierarchical algorithms and is \nsuitable for small-scale agricultural use.\
    \ We conclude that our proposed technological platform with a \nmodified version\
    \ of the LORA_CBF routing algorithm can also be applied to precision agriculture\
    \ \nbecause it is a wireless location-based routing algorithm that uses cluster-based\
    \ flooding and monitors \nresidual battery energy. \nAcknowledgements \nThis work\

    over the world have required various food safety and health issues in the past
    years. Food safety and quality issues generally occur due to incurring problem
    of food products handling processing. The concerns about food safety and quality
    have launched new legislative initiatives along the food supply chain (FSC). These
    factors have led to a growing interest in developing systems for food supply chain
    traceability. The increasing interest directly produces with customer demands
    on food quality and safety in food traceability (Trienekens & Zuurbier, 2008).
    However, the benefits have been categorized as: increase in customer satisfaction,
    improvement in food crises management, and improvement in FSC competence development
    (for companies), technological and scientific contribution and contribution to
    agricultural sustainability (Bosona & Gebresenbet, 2013). A FSC consists of several
    stakeholders among each other such as farmers, producers, processors, distributors,
    retailers. FSC stakeholders typically attribute different values to traceability:
    for the customer it represents a food needs related mainly to safety and quality,
    while for food producers it control food production visibility which might strongly
    affect the product quality. Traceability in the whole supply chain is the capability
    of the stakeholders to tracking and tracing the products throughout the supply
    chain in a forward and/or backward direction. Tracking is the ability to follow
    the downstream path of a product along the supply chain in a forward. Tracing
    refers to the ability to determine upstream path of the origin and characteristics
    of a particular product in a backward (Bechini, Cimino, Marcelloni, & Tomasi,
    2008). Tracing is the reverse process of tracking by which the history of a product
    in food supply chain is aim to identifying problem through food product usage
    life cycle for food safety and quality issues. A FSC traceability system is considered
    as a record-keeping and task-triggering mechanism to improve consumer confidence
    in food consumption and to efficiently reduce the asymmetry of information across
    food supply chains. Research into traceability systems covers some topics such
    as traceability system development (Feng, Fu, Wang, Xu, & Zhang, 2013). Some studies
    proposed to aim at facilitating data acquisition for the development of databases
    and web-based systems for traceability management (Gandino et al., 2009, Ruiz-Garcia
    et al., 2010). Traceability systems required to comply with all stakeholders needs
    can yield a huge volume of information, therefore information technologies (IT)
    with data collection, storage and accessibility become critical. In recent years,
    a great research interest about integrating RFID (radio-frequency identification)
    and EPCglobal (electronic product code) within the food supply chain has emerged
    (Kumar et al., 2009, Myhre et al., 2009). Pizzuti, Mirabelli, Sanz-Bobi, and Gomez-Gonzalez
    (2014) presents the Food Track &Trace Ontology (FTTO) which is part of a general
    framework devoted to managing food traceability and it has been developed a global
    track &trace Information System. Thakur, Sorensen, Bjornson, Foras, and Hurburgh
    (2011) introduces a new methodology for modeling traceability information using
    the EPCIS (EPC information system) framework and UML (unified modeling language).
    Kang and Lee (2013) propose and develop a novel set of services called the traceability
    services using EPCglobal information system. Lin et al. (2011) proposed a WSN-based
    (wireless sensor network) traceability system for aquaculture that can automate
    many monitoring tasks. Based on the requirements of traceability in the food chain,
    a conceptual framework is explored (Aung & Chang, 2014). Alfredo, Alvarez-Melcon,
    Trebar, and Filippin (2014) presents a novel system based on the EPCglobal Architecture
    and developed under the framework ‘‘RFID from Farm to Fork’’ in the aquaculture
    sector. According to the above-mentioned discussion, this article indicates two
    issues. Firstly, the focuses of these studies tend to be on automated identification
    and product problem status in food chain based on internet of thing (IoT) using
    new technology such as RFID, WSN and EPCglobal, there is lacking in modeling the
    traceability process for developing “autonomous” traceability system in comparative
    to “automation”. Secondly, little research has been conducted where the product
    problem information related to the cause of problem, the responsibility attribution
    and their effect on the food quality and safety is recorded simultaneously. Each
    FSC actor should have an autonomous triggered behavior that would enable them
    to trace back from backward product design so as to determine the cause of the
    problem or to efficiently attribute the responsibility. The development and design
    for a food product is the most important issue in a competitive market. The forward
    design is the key on the R&D department. Which a new product is successful or
    fail, is related to the customer product problems. So we can trace the problem
    and clarify the responsibility for efficient performance management. We can accumulate
    experience and feedback to design origin so that mechanisms such as design guidelines/checklist
    can be developed to prevent problem reoccurrences in the future. This is a thought
    which establish a reverse design by reverse thinking (Youngsup & Russell, 1995).
    The food product problems here may be extended to farmers, producers, processors,
    distributors, retailers and customer. When a food product occur problems, it is
    usually a customer brings up the problem and gives the product to the retailer
    for handling. Normally, the food product will be sent to the original retailer
    which is a chain retail store, and then the original retailer will send it to
    distributors to trace. If the distributor cannot handle this problem, it will
    be sent to the producers or processors. This process is a long, complicated and
    not efficient. However, they usually don''t have an efficient way to utilize the
    past information well within the tracing and longwinded flow path. So that when
    the problem occurs next time, they will spend much time on the handling and tracing
    for the problem again. In order to solve the two issues, it is important to develop
    IoT-enabled autonomous systems for food chain traceability through upstream supply
    chain and provide an integrated framework of backward design process seamless
    and relationship in the product usage life cycle. This upstream supply chain includes
    linking units of output with specific units of input for all stakeholders. As
    the IoT techniques become intelligence, emphasis is put upon approaches that allow
    things to become more autonomous. The existence of a large number of variables
    to be considered for FSC traceability to trace the cause of problem and the responsibility
    attribution, due to the additional variables relating to the stakeholders, and
    the uncertainty imposed on the variables require collaborative judgment to identify
    core variables and the causal relationships among them. For such situations, fuzzy
    cognitive maps (FCM) seem to be appropriate to deal with and model complex system
    (Stylios & Groumpos, 2001). We propose the utilization of the fuzzy causal characteristics
    of FCM and fuzzy rule-based knowledge repository as the underlying approach in
    order to generate a hierarchical and dynamic network of interaction performance
    impact. By using the above mentioned approach, this paper design the intelligent
    autonomous tracing system based on IoT architecture using FCM and fuzzy rule method
    for food product usage life cycle. It aimed at simulate complex system with imprecise
    relationships while quantifying the performance impact of backward design process
    efficiency. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces related work
    such as IoT, FCM, intelligent system and software agent. Section 3 presents the
    proposed approach to develop intelligent autonomous tracing system for backward
    design in food supply chain. Section 4 describes the autonomous Tracing FCM by
    state-transition method. Section 5 presents the case study for agriculture food
    product. Section 6 submits experiments that are conducted by utilizing numerical
    analysis of FCM conduct total effects algorithm in the case study. Section 7 concludes
    the work and future research. 2. Related work 2.1. Internet of things With the
    advent of information system and related emerging technology, such as IOT (Internet
    of Things) is available in the Market. The internet of things attributed to the
    Auto-Id Labs (2010) is a novel paradigm that refers to the possibility of endowing
    everyday objects with the ability to identify and interact with each other to
    reach cooperation goals (Giusto, Iera, Morabito, & Atzori, 2010). The IoT describes
    a global network infrastructure, internet-based information service architecture
    around us of a variety of things (objects)-such as RFID tag, sensors, readers,
    actuators, mobile phone, NFC etc. Internet of things is as an infrastructure to
    facilitate the information exchange of products (Amaral et al., 2011, Atzori et
    al., 2010). The technical development of the required infrastructure of components
    is specified by EPCglobal (2013). EPCGlobal architecture is a set of internet
    of things objects and information exchange standard implemented by the international
    organization “EPCGlobal”, it defines the information exchange units such as basic
    form standard, middleware, EPCIS and advanced applications, discovery service
    and pedigree, to integrate into this architecture. Mobile RFID system had focused
    on practical application. The past researches represent solving the quality tracing
    system for quality control in supply chain (Zhang, Ran, & Ren, 2011). The quality
    tracing is traceability capability that it can find the source of food product
    problem and identify of the inputs used and production operations to trace the
    history of product through the supply chain to or from the place and time of production
    (Manos and Manikas, 2010, Resende-Filho and Hurley, 2012). At present, tracing
    system has some application in electric product recalling and food production
    pedigree The role of WSN (wireless sensor network) in the IoT is that of a virtual
    skin by becoming aware of their surroundings to take informed decisions in industrial
    environments. EPCglobal allows for sharing of information related to product problem
    integrated of RFID technology into the EPC standard. The conceptual sensor data
    integration has been exploited the classification approach (Theodorou, 2007).
    2.2. Intelligent system and software agent Taking into account different possible
    intelligent system, a autonomous mechanism can be considered as a self-created
    behavior capable of performing a variety of tasks by triggered event using intelligent
    algorithms based on condition without command instructions in advance. Intelligent
    systems are systems that act as the agents by autonomous learning human-being
    behaviors with the help of artificial intelligence. According to Feigenbaum (1982),
    an intelligent system is an intelligent program that it solves a difficult problem.
    Hayes-Roth (1984) indicates that intelligent systems use a human knowledge in
    order to resolve problem. Previously, some papers had presented intelligent systems
    such as human-expert forum system (Huang, Chen, Kuo, & Jeng, 2008). The so-called
    “intelligent products” are meant to use in the IoT which may be defined as physical
    and virtual objects with unique ID using RFID technology. According to Dimitris
    (2011), he introduced a new definition which contains sensing, memory, data processing,
    reasoning and communication capabilities at various four intelligence levels.
    This paper adapt the forth intelligence level: physicals with product embedded
    information devices. This intelligent product may develop wisdom capabilities.
    The past paper presents an event-triggered software component into intelligent
    distributed control systems (Mohamed & Mosbhahi, 2010). Fuzzy cognitive maps are
    a fuzzy logic methodology that can explore model complexly system using a causal-effect
    fuzzy reasoning. Intelligent systems based on FCMs can be used in modeling and
    simulation of complex systems (Mendonc, Angelico, Arruda, & Neves, 2013). Thus,
    this article proposed intelligent tracing system using FCM. 2.3. FCM A FCM was
    first introduced by Kosko (1986). A FCM consists of nodes and weighted arcs (denoted
    Cij). Nodes represent concepts or states. A FCM is composed of concept node (C)
    of a problem, signed directed arrows, and causality value (eir of Cij) among the
    other nodes. Meanwhile, weighted arcs represent causality between pairs of concepts.
    If each concept is characterized by a variable Vi, the weighted arcs Cij is formed
    by the influence of causal concept Vi on concept Vj. The Cij take care value in
    the fuzzy interval [−1, 1]. Cij = −0 explains no relationship. Cij > 0 defines
    positive causality (increase). Cij < 0 indicates negative causality (decrease).
    In order to describe the degree of the relationship between nodes, it is possible
    to use fuzzy linguistic terms such as “large”, “medium” and “small”. A FCM-based
    approach is chosen as it allows easy integration of the different tasks of tracing
    process in upstream stakeholders and quantification of the degree of haziness
    in relationships among the variables concerned. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps is a modeling
    methodology for complex decision systems. FCM in a graphical illustration seem
    to be a signed directed graph with multiple maps, loops, cycles etc. FCMs have
    been commonly used in the field of supply chain. A good review of recent applications
    and advances in FCM modeling can be found in Glykas (2010). Thakur et al. (2011)
    present that state and transitions can be used for modeling food traceability
    information. Lee, Lee, Lee, and Lim (2013) proposed an agent based inference method
    to overcome dynamic relationships, time lags, and reusability issues of FCM evaluation
    that represents industrial marketing planning problem. These authors also indicate
    “feedback” applied into FCM evaluation. They indicate that a feedback is positive
    (negative) if an increase in the first variable leads to an increase (decrease)
    in the second variable. Thus, this article proposes feedback-based FCM for feedback
    design in food product problem tracing upstream FSC. Carvalho (2013) proposed
    the semantics and the possible use of FCM as tools to model and simulate complex
    social systems when one models or interprets a FCM, it is necessary to have in
    mind the meaning of a concept and of the relations. Since relations and concepts
    on a FCM must semantically represent variations, this article explore fuzzy rule-based
    FCM to go against the semantics of the presented causality definition. 3. Intelligent
    autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain According to
    the Cooper''s study (1994), the forward design of a new product development process
    is divided to seven steps, such as an idea beginning of a product, early estimation,
    a concept design, product development, product test, pile run, and mass production.
    Hamilton and Beeby (1991) indicate that traceability is defined by as the ability
    to discover the design history of every feature of a product from product design
    and development perspective. In this paper, the backward design process means
    starting at users and back to farmers, producers, processors, distributors, retailers
    etc. These become a tracing process for product usage life cycle in Fig. 1. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Tracing process for product usage life cycle.
    The proposed system is divided into four methods such as the architecture of intelligent
    tracing system, the integrated framework for food product problem feedback process,
    integrated framework of IoT-based product usage life cycle, and autonomous agent-based
    tracing system using IoT. They are described as follows. 3.1. The architecture
    of intelligent tracing system This article proposes the architecture of intelligent
    tracing system in Fig. 2. Through this architecture, food product problem can
    be traced and it will be via two ways. One way, if the food product problem is
    a new problem, it will be classified automatically to the upstream organization,
    and store the problem-solving solutions into the knowledge warehouse for the fuzzy
    data storage model. These can avoid happening again and become the guideline reference
    to the product development. Thus, this article is knowledge intensive process
    by causal relationship. Causal relationship knowledge, which utilizes causal reasoning,
    is particularly useful because it seeks to establish the relationship between
    causes and responsibility in the food product design process. By modeling these
    causal relationships, the traceability of food product problem are executed and
    their effects are predicted. The other way, we can get the cause from the upstream
    organization to respond to the customers instantly for problem-solving. The food
    product problem feedback comes from the upstream such as the farmers, producers,
    processors, distributors, retailers. In order to respond and handle the complex
    process, it needs a software agent based on IoT architecture with autonomous algorithm
    instead of the artificial process. In Fig. 2, we can see that the software agent
    execute the feedback from the product problems and store problem-solving solution
    in the fuzzy rule-based knowledge repository. According to the above mentioned,
    we know that actualization of the IoT into the information system is possible
    through the integration of several enabling technology such as EPC (electronic
    product code). The EPC could support the spread use of RFID in industry-driven
    global standards based on IoT technology for the EPCGlobal network. From the EPCGlobal
    point of view, there is a demand for the development of complex information systems
    in the IoT-based systems that can be archived taking advantage of intelligent
    service-integrated platform like autonomous reasoning of systems. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. The architecture of intelligent tracing system. 3.2. Integrated
    framework for food product problem feedback process According the architecture
    of intelligent tracing system in Fig. 2, this paper will describe an integrated
    framework for formalizing such a food product problem feedback process using object-oriented
    relationship method through the product usage life cycle. Generally, the process
    of the food product problem is started at the service after sales department.
    Then, it is handled by the original producer or the channel department. It is
    less to make a further inquiry into the problem and cause classification and the
    responsibility to which upstream organization and rarely to tracing to the design
    rule of R&D for reference. In such a case, it will make an influence that could
    not respond to customer promptly. So this paper will build up an integrated framework
    of food product problem feedback to link upstream food supply chain and is described
    as follows: (1) Firstly, the food product upstream supply chain is divided into
    six stages such as the farmers, producers, processors, distributors, retailers,
    user, and each stage is downward defined the industry function process, and then
    it is referenced as the right part of Fig. 3. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. The integrated framework. (2) Then, it defined the happening location
    of each problem according to the different stage as a participation role, such
    as processors, distributors, retailers etc., and which is corresponded with the
    cause of the problem. And it maps the cause to the department of the organization
    to clarify the responsible unit for attribution. It is referenced as the left
    part of Fig. 3. (3). Moreover, fast and correctly map the problem characteristic
    to the department which cause the problem and to the six stages of the upstream
    supply chain. For Fig. 3, it is known that some problem may not be caused by single
    cause (for example: the cause which the problem A is high probability in the sales
    department. It is higher than the probability in the material department) Developing
    a food traceability system is a complex undertaking system as it involves all
    the stages of production, handling, storage, processing, transportation and distribution
    for upstream food supply chain. So, the food traceability system must has an integrated
    framework to trace the cause of problem, the responsibility attribution and their
    effects on the food quality and safety. A food product problem feedback process
    is very complex and many-to-many relationships; it must be built by structured
    multi-level many-to-many relation based on object-oriented relationship method
    such as class level diagram in order to deal with problem-cause identification
    or responsible attribution. The paper will use class hierarchy diagram to connect
    all stages for upstream food supply chain seamlessly. The integrated framework
    focuses on analyzing and feeding the problem-causes to appropriate departments
    such as R&D, PE(product engineering), Man.(manufacturing), IE(industrial engineering),
    Mat.(material), Pro.(procurement), Log.(logistical), ship, channel, sale, etc.
    for further evaluation and actions. The organization''s responses to the problem-causes
    can be learned and response performance evaluated for incentive or penalties.
    We use the class hierarchy diagram, aggregation, and composition in the object-oriented
    relationship method to analyze the multi-level many-to-many relation. The class
    level diagram shows the multi-level. The aggregation show a one-to-many relation.
    The composition is the key connection. In this structure, its benefit is to frame
    a hierarchy for the product problems and to reach an instant and coordinate interaction.
    The steps of class level diagram are shows as follows. Step1. Analyze the relative
    and basic class: problem class, cause class, responsibility department class.
    Step2. Define the properties of each class: the symptom properties in the problem
    class. Step3. Define the super-class and sub-class: the general problems in super-class,
    the specific roles problems in sub-class. Step4. Set up the relationship between
    the classes by aggregation and combination: the general problem class and specific
    roles problem class are in aggregation (shows in white diamonds). The specific
    roles problem class and responsibility class are in combination (shows in black
    diamond) Step5. The development of the class level diagram shows in Fig. 4 Download

    feedback process. 3.3. Integrated framework of IoT-based product usage life cycle
    From intelligent traceability system perspectives, this paper will describe an
    integrated framework of IoT-based product usage life cycle as followings. The
    automatic identification of intelligent product plays an event-trigger role in
    the product usage life cycle for IoT architecture with RFID technology. RFID system
    comprises tags (transponders) and readers (transceivers). The tag stores a unique
    identifier, the Electronic Product Code (EPC). The reader can interrogate tags
    within its region with advert of RFID system. The information of moving products
    can be equipped with RFID readers to identify and update the central database
    with the captured information. Once finding problem which organization occurred,
    the next step is carry on symptom diagnosis to identify the cause of product problem,
    and then the tracing process should be furthermore identified where the cause,
    responsible and solution occurred in the upstream organization of product usage
    life cycle. Fig. 5 shows on the IoT-based tracing system using EPCGlobal standard,
    which contains the following four layers: (1) Infrastructure layer: includes physical
    environment such as RFID tag, reader and server, as well as network such as wireless
    sensor network (WSN) and internet. The WSN with RFID system can cooperate to better
    trace the status of product problem. Among this layer features, these intelligent
    products allow monitoring and recording information of the intelligent food products
    for product usage life cycle. (2) Information layer: includes middleware mechanism
    and software agent. The middleware is a software layer between the infrastructure
    layer and application lays. This layer plays a role in the automatic data filter
    and transfer using middleware software. Problem-solving information of products
    changes a series of “events” through product usage life cycle. Events describe
    the situation and may correspond to the post condition or precondition of some
    functions. An event-driven triggers a procedure with different state. The procedure
    should be formatted in such a way that it always is tracing problem-solving status
    of product usage life cycle. Information processing can realize real-time monitoring
    and recording of almost every link of the product usage life cycle. An agent is
    a computer system that is situated in some environment, and that is capable of
    autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives.
    The concept of autonomous tracing processes is an approach of solve complex backward
    design process for product usage life cycle by representing each software agent
    by event-triggered in the collaborative environment. (3) Application layer: Application
    is exporting tracing system''s functionalities to the food traceability approach.
    This layer by the tracing system should be processed for the purposes of simulating
    the path of backward design process using FCM method and then stored by the fuzzy
    rule database system. This has led to one approach that emphasizes tracing process
    to realize the cognitive backward design process underlying multi-attributes of
    cause–responsibility relationship for food traceability using FCM method. There
    is a number of motivating factors or drivers for traceability in the food supply
    chain with regard to food safety, quality and visibility (Aung & Chang, 2014).
    These drives consist of safety, quality, competitive advantages, trade globalization,
    chain communication, supply chain efficiency, labor/cost reduction, legislation,
    etc. This tracing system can explore collaborative interaction during backward
    design inference mechanism using fuzzy rule method. The proposed integrated framework
    is divided into three logical subsystems based on EPCglobal standard, namely the
    identification, capture and exchange subsystems. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Integrated framework of IoT-based tracing system. 3.4. Autonomous
    agent-based tracing system using IoT Generally, software system presenting different
    automation levels such as monitoring, alarm and control action. It is different
    from autonomous mechanism. Autonomous traceability is defined as the food tracing
    processes where events by triggered when meet condition are recognized actions
    in a timely in order to respond quickly to FSC. Event-based actions by triggered
    gives the ability to generate traceability graphs to be traversed in the case
    of a food safety incident, which originating upstream of a specific location in
    a food supply chain. In this article, we propose intelligent IoT-based tracing
    system. Intelligent IoT-based tracing system puts emphasis on the problem-solving
    needs of the backward design process to satisfy these needs of upstream food supply
    chain which is triggered by event-driven of the farmers, producers, processors,
    distributors, retailers using autonomous agent procedure in Fig. 6. Given that
    agents can reason using specific algorithm and then react to different situations
    accordingly our approach provides a more intelligent, flexible, and autonomous
    solution to event handling in intelligent tracing system for upstream FSC. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Autonomous agent procedures. In proposed intelligent
    tracing system, different tasks in the food product problem feedback process,
    such as identifying, clarifying, attributing, event triggering and computing,
    are delegated to a number of both autonomous and collaborative agents. Given that
    agents can reason using specific algorithm and then react to different situations
    accordingly our approach provides a more intelligent, flexible, and autonomous
    solution to event handling in intelligent tracing system for upstream FSC. Where
    there is food product problem in the product tracing process should be started
    at the original place where the problem occurred. By tracing how the problem occurred,
    we can figure out the upstream responsible organization such as producer, processor
    and farmer. The novelty of this study in solving a practical problem (developing
    an autonomous tracing system to support food traceability) lies in overcoming
    the limitations of traditional FCMs in representing the link weight in the causal
    relationships among concepts that are common in food traceability, so that food
    product problem feedback process can be traced later through the integration of
    agent technology. In order for any traceability system to meet requirements of
    ensuring food quality and safety, there is need to integrate all this information
    into an autonomous tracing system for backward design so that a problem caused
    either due to processing or handling can be identified and traced back to the
    source. To ensure this need, it is important to use new technology such as IoT
    technology. In general, these software agents are applied in a multi-layers network
    based on IoT technology like wireless communication, sensor and RFID, these RFID
    and sensor systems are essential to monitor the usage status continuously and
    facilitate autonomously instead of humanly in the product usage life cycle. In
    order to meet the above-mentioned objective, this article submits an autonomous
    agent procedure to tracing food product problem upstream FSC in Fig. 6. This procedure
    consists of three components such as transition, task and algorithm. A transition
    is always embedded in the software agent with object-oriented schema and method
    of its source state in Fig. 6. A task expression associated to the transition
    can be implemented directly in the EPCIS event based on IoT as a triggered event
    when condition is satisfied. Once EPCIS event is triggered, the submission and
    delegate will be executed. A selection algorithm based on autonomous agent procedures
    is embedded in the method of object-oriented database for state-transition through
    transformed parameters. This algorithm will be discussed in Section 4. Moreover,
    these tasks can be autonomously reached by the intelligent system made of autonomous
    software agents. 4. Autonomous Tracing FCM This section proposes an autonomous
    tracing algorithm approach (ATFCM, Autonomous Tracing FCM) as a solution to improve
    the applicability of the FCM and fuzzy rule to food product problems tracing process.
    In this article, ATFCM approach for decision making of causal relationship impact
    to human way of thinking simulation process using FCM with fuzzy rule and software
    agent is discussed. The term “causal” indicates cause and effect relationship.
    Autonomous agents control both over their internal states and over their own behaviors
    so as to dynamically respond and adapt to a changing environment (Lee et al.,
    2004, Marconi et al., 2006). A FCM describes the behavior of a system in terms
    of concepts; each concept representing a state of the system (Xirogiannis & Glykas,
    2004). 4.1. Autonomous tracing algorithm According to the above-mentioned, this
    proposed autonomous tracing algorithm adopts state-transition method using fuzzy
    set to construct algorithm procedure by integrated FCM and software agent. The
    state-transition of FCM integrates all food product problems and responsibility
    information as well as drivers of food traceability into autonomous tracing system
    for backward design in food supply chain. This model forms the basis for mapping
    food production transitions to EPCIS events and linking them to corresponding
    food product problem tracing parameters of food traceability. In fuzzy cognitive
    maps are weighted and directed graph with feedback. The graph nodes are used to
    model concepts describing the system behavior. These concepts as “states” are
    connected by weighted arcs as “transition” representing the causal relationships
    between them in FCM. Each transition represents from one state (denoted P) to
    the next, i.e. Pi → Pr, A state-transition is a visual path consisting of cause–effect
    relationship representing states linked together with transitions. A state can
    contain entry/exit tasks in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, for example, food product problem
    traceability with “cause of problem” entry tasks for retailer and “responsibility
    of problem” exit tasks for producer. A typical transition can be denoted by an
    event and a sequence of atomic tasks by called ‘task chain’. A transition will
    execute the task chain when the event is triggered. Formally, at each state node
    i associate an initial variable Vi ranged 0∼1(initial score from expert''s opinion)
    for Pi, which accounts for the fuzzy matrix algorithm contained in the state node
    i. These states are formally described introducing an m*m Fuzzy weight matrix
    in Equation (1), where m is the total numbers of entry/exit tasks. Pi is represented
    by fuzzy weight matrix for state i and is described as follows. Assumed m = 3,
    i = 3 from Fig. 7). (1) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. State-transition
    process. The definition of L has the following structure: Li,1 indicates the entry
    task of the state i, while Li,2 represents its exit task. For any state node i
    (assumed i = 3), one defines the sets of links entry and exit node as and , k
    and j belong to entry and exit node for some states, respectively. For example
    in state node 3,in3 = {V1,V2}, out3 = {V4} (2) The example from Fig. 7 is described
    as follows. After calculating Si, we can obtain next state Vr of Pr from this
    state Vi of Pi by using state-transition step: (3) where Vr(i) is a update variable
    score of state r for Vr transition from i to r, eir is causal relationship value
    between state i and state r. If this state-transition belongs to entry task then
    adopt “+” because the entry task can enhance next state node score. If this state-transition
    belongs to exit task then adopt “−” because the exit task can reduce next state
    node score. For the above-mentioned example using Equation (3), we obtain: This
    state-transition step is executed when the triggered-event occurs owing to condition
    is satisfied. To ensure effective decisions are made in evaluating condition quality
    based on this autonomous tracing algorithm, it is important to adequately establish
    condition model using fuzzy rule method. Fuzzy rules can be generated using IF-THEN
    statements: IF (fuzzy proposition) THEN (fuzzy proposition). A fuzzy rule-based
    is systematic inference method that can capture the knowledge judgment of experts
    by using Fuzzy rules. It can be generated using IF-THEN statements: IF (fuzzy
    proposition) THEN (fuzzy proposition). From the discussion above, fuzzy rule-based
    knowledge repository can be constructed using IF-THEN statement to assist food
    problem tracing in screening the problem-solving alternatives of design consideration.
    The statement is as followings: IF (cause, responsibility of problem with fuzzy
    number) AND (the problem-solving alternatives) THEN (design consideration). Consequently,
    the autonomous tracing algorithm consists of state-transition method using fuzzy
    set and fuzzy rule method. 4.2. ATFCM procedure According to the above-mentioned
    discussion in Section 4.1, the proposed ATFCM procedure is summarized as follows
    and shown in Fig. 8. Step1: Establish object-oriented database using class level
    diagrams Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. ATFCM procedure. Every object
    is independent entity. All objects in fuzzy object-oriented databases include
    three components: object name as roles, schema as cause/responsibility and method
    as algorithm in Fig. 6. Each objects also denoted as “state” and “agent”. The
    method stores logical formulas and describes object behavior logic, which is described
    by autonomous tracing algorithm. Furthermore, we linked these all objects (states)
    using class hierarchy diagram, aggregation, and composition. Step2. Calculate
    cause-responsibility mapping degree using fuzzy classification accuracy At this
    step, the food traceability system must have an integrated framework to trace
    the cause of problem, the responsibility attribution and their effects on the
    food quality and safety in Fig. 3. We define a classification accuracy rate (S(S,C))
    as the mapping degree for clarifying cause-responsibility in Equation (4), which
    is attributed to a composite measure of design dimensions (Chen, 2009, Yuan and
    Shaw, 1995). Definition 1 Given the fuzzy data, the accuracy probability of the
    classification can be defined as (4) The fuzzy subset hood S(S,C) measures the
    degree with the accuracy probability of the classification to which S is a subset
    of C. A fuzzy method is a generalization of the crisp case. Before giving the
    definition, we denote the following symbols: U(X) is the family of all fuzzy subsets
    defined on X, and the cardinality measure of a fuzzy subset. x is given finite
    data of U(X). S is defined by the membership of a fuzzy subset US which takes
    values in the interval [1, 0] in a universe of U(X). Forx∈U,US(x) = 1 means that
    x is definitely a member of S and US(x) = 0 means that x is definitely not a member
    of S, S is a crisp set. (5) The intersection S∩C is defined by probability summation
    for S and C. Step3. Construct FCM graph Fuzzy causal relationships link states
    to each other and they formulate the adjacency matrix. This step exploited the
    adjacency matrix representation of fuzzy cognitive maps. Based on this result
    of interrelationship matrix by this Delphi, we can build the fuzzy causal relationship
    to gain initial version adjacency matrix of FCM. The initial version of adjacency
    matrix can be converted into a following refined values fall between 0 and 1.
    Causal relationships link component to each other and they formulate the adjacency
    matrix. The much causal chaining information can be gained from reachable adjacency
    matrices. Causality admits of degree, and vague degrees at that. It illustrates
    this systematic approach how to construct food product problem tracing system
    through upstream stakeholders such as farmers, producers, processors, distributors,
    retailers with fuzzy causal relationship for the linkages among these concepts
    (states) based on product usage life cycle. In order to realize fully the cognitive
    complexity of backward design process, the comprehension process must be utilized
    significantly the tracing system using FCM method. To identify these states relevant
    to the fuzzy causal relationship, tasks chain should be discussed as follows.
    From tracing the information loops, these flows are starting food product problem,
    and then back to retailers, distributors, processors, producers and farmers in
    the backward design process. So, this process explores design consideration methodology
    such as design for use, design for channel, design for distribution, design for
    ship, design for produce and design for farm source. The flow of the FCM inside
    the food supply chain is modeled via a number of oriented arrows by links of the
    graph. Step4. Fuzzy rule The systematic fuzzy rule base is developed for fault
    classification, reducing the redundancies and complexities system (Samantaray,
    2013). Thus, fuzzy linguistic rules are easily understandable for database system.
    They can well explain how and why an instance has been judged as similar to a
    query problem through rule database system. Such fuzzy rules can cover a group
    of elementary rules that use to judgment basis of event by triggered as rule conditions.
    Fuzzy rules representation offers a more flexible means to express the condition
    whether is satisfied or not than traditional rule. The fuzzy rules aim to assist
    food problem tracing in screening the problem-solving alternatives of design consideration
    in this article. For example, the statement is as follows: IF (cause, responsibility
    of problem with fuzzy number) AND (the problem-solving alternatives) THEN (design
    consideration). In this article, we use S(S,C) method represented the mean of
    “cause, responsibility of problem with fuzzy number”. Thus, this fuzzy rule can
    translate the following statement: IF (S(S,C) >= threshold value) AND (the problem-solving
    alternatives is A) THEN (design consideration for D). where threshold value represent
    at the least mapping degree for clarifying cause-responsibility. where A represent
    problem-solving alternatives from responsibility department (C) to tracing the
    food product problem and clarify the responsibility for efficient performance
    management. where D represent design consideration for roles from upstream various
    stages of FSC to make “Out-of-control action plans” so that future problems can
    be properly and quickly resolved. Thus, the fuzzy rule aims to help that the autonomous
    tracing system can accumulate experience and feedback to design origin so that
    mechanisms such as design guidelines/checklist can be developed to prevent food
    product problem reoccurrences for food quality and safety in the future. Carvalho
    and Tomé (1999) proposed a rule based fuzzy cognitive map (RBFCM) where fuzzy
    rules are explored for reasoning. Furthermore, it is necessary to adequately establish
    condition model using fuzzy rule method for autonomous tracing algorithm based
    on FCM. Thus, the fuzzy rule is used to condition model and when it is satisfied
    by triggered-event the state-transition step will be executed. Once state-transition
    step be executed, some variable Vi score of state node i will be changed. These
    changes will effect new FCM graph using inference process in next step Step5.
    Simulate the inference food product problem tracing process ATFCMs are soft computing
    tools, which link food task chain including stakeholders upstream FSC with elements
    of fuzzy logic. It aimed to simulate complex system linked cause-responsibility
    with imprecise relationships for food product quality based on all stakeholders
    while quantifying the performance impact of decision-making efficiency for food
    product problem tracing system. Based on benefits of food traceability, it describes
    one input vectors such as customer satisfaction, Based on the six stakeholders
    of upstream FSC from expert''s opinion using Delphi method, it describes six states
    the adjacency matrix of FCM. In addition, the adjacency matrix can be used usefully
    for changes of multiple states. Therefore multiplying a clear measuring the tracing
    effects resulting from this input vector with adjacency matrix, it can obtain
    output vector. Once the state value of the input vector is changed, the output
    vector may be interpreted such that changes way affect these states each other.
    5. Case study To validate the ATFCM methodology described above, we prepare a
    case study by simulation for agriculture food product as proposed food product
    kind. The agriculture food product is a description given to a complex global
    diversity of businesses that supply and produce much of the food. The FSC conceptualizes
    related to the process domain in the field of the agriculture food processes.
    The agriculture food processes includes crop cultivation and livestock production.
    This article use agriculture food processes as case study based on generic food
    supply chain including farmers, producers, processors, distributors, retailers
    and customer. The crop cultivation process includes the activities of sowing,
    irrigation, weeding and harvesting. The livestock production process includes
    feeding processes and watering. Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an
    agricultural setting to produce commodities such as meat food. Farming practices
    for growing animals are different depending on the type of animals and breading
    farm. Food distribution is a method of distributing or transporting food from
    one place to another through transportation, food handling technology and supply
    logistics. Food retail outlets can serve as food sale of commercial development
    such as grocery stores and supermarkets. The case study combines agriculture food
    processes with generic food supply chain and is described as sowing/irrigation
    for farmer, weeding/animal feeding for producer, meat butcher/meat processing
    for processor, picking/packing for distributor, and handling/re-packing for retailer.
    In order to tracing food safety and quality, important information such as cause-responsibility
    of food product problem must be automated recorded for each process depending
    on the specific tasks operated on food. The analysis of case study underlines
    that since a food product moves from the primary farm source to the final customer,
    that product goes through a number of transformations. Each transformation will
    involve different agents. Every agent must collect, keep and share information
    in order to enable food product problem traceability. Important information to
    store for each object operated in a unit operation is information on process parameters,
    such as environmental parameters like temperature, humidity and pressure. These
    parameters will be taken to attributes of food product problem cause. Some object
    properties have been introduced for representing the knowledge related to the
    processes operated in upstream FSC. According to the above-mentioned, this section
    divided into two sub-sections as follows. 5.1. IoT-based autonomous tracing system
    The proposed tracing system for backward design process is described as follows
    in Fig. 9. The RFID tag is encoded with an EPC number, while the RFID paper label
    is printed with the same information used so far and with QR code. RFID middleware
    reads the tag to store a new event in the EPCIS repository. Every meat food product
    is tagged with an RFID tag in order to be identified and collect tracing information
    during FSC operations. The collection of tracing information such as tracing status
    as meat food product handling/re-packing with at the retailer store is done using
    RFID handheld readers. Furthermore, RFID data loggers are also placed in the WSN
    environment to monitor the tracing status such as picking/packing during the transport
    from processor to distributor. The processor is also equipped with RFID handheld
    and fixed readers to collect the information from the meat butcher/meat processing
    process. Afterward, animal feeding status is identified in the WSN environment
    by a gate with an RFID portal that reads every EPC of the animal as they enter
    through the farm gate. For farmer stage, embedded WSN on farm environment can
    real time automatic record operational parameters while the sowing and irrigation
    are in process, such as temperature, humidity and element of seed as well as farm
    location via GPS for traceability purposes. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 9. IoT-based autonomous tracing system. When the meat food products fail,
    the symptom caused the product failure can be obtained through customer respond,
    and the information of the respond used to form the meat food product can be obtained
    through smart phone APP software and QR code, by which combined together we can
    get the related information of meat food products and its pedigree, furthermore
    to trace to the original farm as well as root reason caused the product failure
    through IoT-based autonomous tracing system. The tracing system is the link which
    connects retailer, distributor, processor, producer and farmer, and is consummated
    by combined with the relationship among these stages. RFID-enabled meat food product
    (denoted intelligent product) and WSN environment make them possible to automatic
    record data without any direct human intervention. These records are stored at
    object-oriented database system for this meat food product and take as assessment
    base for data source of S(S,C). Furthermore, they allow storing information in
    the object-oriented database system at each step of the upstream supply chain
    by software agent that consists of six roles. These software agents allow the
    event to trigger about the processes while some conditions are satisfied, and
    send events to the EPCIS repository. Once event is triggered, the ATFCM implementation
    is executed as follows in Section 5.2. 5.2. ATFCM implementation To further realize
    the autonomous tracing system with this agriculture food case, we used an ATFCM
    method for backward design in food supply chain. For the acquisition of domain
    expert knowledge, the FCM constructor is developed and ATFCM is systematically
    generated from the FCM. Through case studies, we show that ATFCM for customer
    satisfaction benefit is an efficient methodology for capturing causal knowledge
    of domain experts and is described as follows six steps according to the Section
    4. Step1. Establish object-oriented database using class level diagrams In the
    object elements of object-oriented databases, the symptom of cause is fuzzy sets,
    and the cause-responsibility is also fuzzy set. Fuzzy sets are the set of every
    element in object and its corresponding membership degree. We build the classification
    accuracy rate (S(S,C)) in the method of object. We can input these fuzzy values
    into this method and then get value of (S(S,C)). From the above-mentioned, we
    establish a class level diagram based on Fig. 4 by using the object-oriented method
    in Fig. 10 for agriculture food case study. From Fig. 10, we can know that six
    objects as roles (state) is established. They are farmer, producer, processor,
    distributor, retailer, customer, respectively. Each object consists of schema
    (cause-symptom) and method (cause-responsibility attribution), for example, schema
    of the farmer object is “sowing/irrigation” and method of one is “cause-responsibility:
    PE/R&D department”. These objects form a class level diagram for agriculture food
    case study. The farmer, producer and processor object link to distributor and
    retailer object using aggregation (shows in white diamonds). These five objects
    (farmer, producer, processor, distributor and retailer) explore specific object
    with method using combination (shows in black diamond). In such as this diagram,
    its benefit is to frame a hierarchy for the food product problems and is to reach
    an instant and coordinate interaction in tracing system for backward design upstream
    FSC. Step2. Calculate cause-responsibility mapping degree using fuzzy classification
    accuracy Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Example of class level diagram.
    According to step2, we gain five classification accuracy rates and all fuzzy data
    for five objects such as farmer, producer, processor, distributor and retailer
    for customer satisfaction benefits. This algorithm in the classification accuracy
    of cause-responsibility from Equation (4) is described as follows. An example
    of the data for farmer object with fuzzy values is shown in Table 1. It lists
    the cause of food product problem (S) for customer satisfaction. Table 1. The
    fuzzy data for farmer object. S = cause Sowing/Irrigation C = responsibility department
    H M L H M L PE department R&D department No.1 0.3 0.4 0.6 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.3
    No.2 0.5 0.3 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.4 No.3 0.6 0.2 0.4 0.7 0.4 0.5 0.3 0.3 The
    cause (S) has two attributes: S = {sowing, irrigation}, and each attribute has
    three values: It has two classes: Gain as the same procedure: As result using
    average method for farmer object: S(S, C) = (0.638 + 0.661)/2 = 0.715. Gain as
    the same procedure: As result using average method for producer, processor, distributor
    and retailer: 0.66, 0.12, 0.56, 0.67. These S(S,C) will be adopted judgment base
    for fuzzy rule. Step3. Construct FCM graph From food product quality and safety
    perspectives, quality tracing favors in describing problems by backward design.
    To the FSC, when the customer meets the product with quality problems, it stresses
    on qualitative problem description and determines the root reason of the problem
    by marking, retrieving and analyzing the data and events. When there is the above-mentioned
    food product problem in the product, tracing process should be started at the
    place where the problem occurred, and all the stakeholders (stages) within food
    products problem should be found out by tracing gradually with software agent
    system using FCM network. In order to build an FCM, the knowledge and experience
    of one expert on the system''s operation with Delphi must be used to reach a consensus
    among the experts in FCM (Bryson, Mobolurin, & Joseph, 1997). In this article,
    we adopt some expert''s opinion using Delphi to build initial FCM. The concepts
    (states) of FCM consist of six factors such as farmer, producer, processor, distributor,
    retailer and customer. In this study, the initial FCM adopts Delphi questionnaires
    with these six factors relationships. This Delphi questionnaires are based on
    the relationship indicator''s evaluation value by refined values fall between
    0 and 1. The threshold value 0.3 is determined to select accepted opinion. If
    it is no less than 0.3, this expert''s opinion is accepted. A Delphi questionnaire
    might include some statements with relationship indicators, for example: ‘What
    relationship degree are them among these six factors in the food product tracing
    process for agriculture food product?’ The survey questionnaire included a 0 and
    1 scale to identify which factor is considered most important relationship with
    another factor. The Delphi questionnaires were asked to rate 36 statements (6*6
    factors) with relationship indicators according to these six factors by 3 experts.
    It can be seen from Delphi questionnaires that 13 relationship information indicators
    were accepted after survey was finished. These information can be constructed
    initial FCM in ATFCM algorithm. By tracing how the problem occurred in FCM, we
    can figure out the responsible department, furthermore problem-solving alternatives,
    and design consideration for specific stage upstream FSC for backward design process.
    In the backward design process by food product problem, there are customer feedback,
    distributor feedback, processor feedback, and producer feedback to improve the
    product quality and provide constructive problem-solving alternatives for the
    food product design in the entire stages upstream FSC. Meanwhile, we can find
    out the causal relationship among these stages. And the whole tracing process
    for this case study is shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 shows fuzzy causal relationships
    represented FCM graphic and forms initial version of adjacency matrix M in Table
    2. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Initial FCM for food product tracing.

    tracing process includes product problem description, cause of problem, responsible
    department for six stages upstream FSC. By inputting related problem description
    and cause-responsibility attribution, you can carry on fuzzy rule-based conditions
    and verify at the stage place where root reason is attributed with regard to this
    condition. Thus, next step will introduce this fuzzy rule-based condition. Step4.
    Fuzzy rule To reduce the food product problem tracing burden on the decision maker
    in the evaluation and selection process, rules-based consisting of fuzzy IF–THEN
    rules are used to assist in tracing efficiency of FCM by triggered event. According
    to agriculture food case study, this article generates fuzzy rule data by collecting
    food industry information and expert interview using Delphi method. A Delphi process
    is used to determine the evaluation and selection criteria which help prioritize
    the criteria so that a consensus can be reached for evaluating and selecting the
    available fuzzy rule. As a result of this process, five fuzzy rules are identified
    for evaluating design consideration, including threshold value of S(S,C) and problem-solving
    alternatives in Table 3. In the form of fuzzy rules, each fuzzy rule is a conditional
    statement and is described as allows. If S(S,C) > threshold value and problem-solving
    alternatives ∈ specific stage then condition is satisfied and further provide
    design consideration for specific stage based on upstream FSC, otherwise the condition
    is incomplete. Table 3. Case study of fuzzy rule. Rule Fuzzy rule Responsibility
    Threshold value Rule 1 for farmer IF (S(S, C) >= 0.6) AND (the problem-solving
    alternatives is weather variability) THEN (design consideration for farm source)
    R&D, PE (product engineering) 0.6 Rule 2 for producer IF (S (S, C) >= 0.5) AND
    (the problem-solving alternatives is poor nutrition) THEN (design consideration
    for production) Man.(manufacturing), IE (industrial engineering) 0.5 Rule 3 for
    processor IF (S (S, C) >= 0.7) AND (the problem-solving alternatives is environmental
    pollutants) THEN (design consideration for fabrication) Mat.(material), Pro.(procurement)
    0.7 Rule 4 for distributor IF (S (S, C) >= 0.4) AND (the problem-solving alternatives
    is food protection) THEN (design consideration for logistical operation) Log.(logistical),
    ship 0.4 Rule 5 for retailer IF (S (S, C) >= 0.5) AND (the problem-solving alternatives
    is harmful detergent) THEN (design consideration for channel management) Channel,
    sale 0.5 From the fuzzy rule-based condition in Table 3 with calculated result
    in step2, the state-transition step will be executed when it is satisfied by triggered-event.
    Once state-transition step be executed, some variable Vi score of state node i
    will be changed. These calculated changes from Equation (3) are shown as Table
    4. From the Table 4, for example, results of Vi are V1(5), V2(4), V4(3), respectively
    for customer satisfaction benefits alternative. Step5. Simulate the inference

    Causal State (stage) (customer satisfaction benefit) I II III IV V VI V1 V2 V3
    V4 V5 V6 I II III 0.7 IV 0.5 V 0.6 VI In the inference process, I assume an inference
    vector which is defined as a vector showing a set of input or output values. In
    addition, the adjacency matrix M can be used for clearly measuring the effects
    resulting from change of multiple factors. There are six concept nodes in Fig.
    11 which are interrelated with fuzzy causality values. By referring to Fig. 11,
    the adjacency matrix M is derived in Table 2. According to state-transition for
    customer satisfaction benefit that input factors are changed base on the V1(5),
    V2(4), V4(3) (farmer, producer and distributor), the input vector may be obtained
    as follows: Input vector: [0.6, 0.5, 0, 0.7, 0, 0] Therefore multiplying this
    input vector with adjacency matrix, we can obtain an output vector as follows:
    Output vector: [0.25, 0.18, 0.54, 0.36, 0, 0.7] From the above calculated result,
    the output vector such as customer satisfaction benefit may be interpreted such
    that change in those factors including farmer, producer and distributor affect
    farmer by 0.25, producer by 0.18, processor by 0.54, distributor by 0.36 and customer
    by 0.7. Therefore, we can conclude that changes of two factors may affect the
    processor and customer most favorably (>=0.5). Thus, these two factors are used
    to take as identified items for measure metric. The adjacency matrix shows that
    the variation of some factors causes an effect on other factors and the effectiveness
    of tracing system for backward design process. The direction and strength of cause
    and effect linkages are representing the state of relationship management and
    the performance of tracing system. If the number of factors that are varied becomes
    higher, this leads to the great effectiveness of tracing system. It is possible
    to find the input vector that leads to the highest effectiveness of tracing system.
    6. Experiment The experiments that are conducted by utilizing numerical analysis
    of FCM conduct total effects algorithm in the case study. In order to analyze
    the factors affecting the tracing performance impact, it is necessary to conduct
    the numerical analysis of FCMs. FCM is analyzed in order to determine the sense
    of the effect caused by the variations of each fuzzy state. The numerical analysis
    of FCM conduct total effects algorithm. The total effects for each factor should
    be evaluated to determine the influences on the tracing performance impact of
    backward design process efficiency in the IoT-based system. Furthermore, the criteria
    to evaluate the tracing performance of the autonomous tracing process have to
    extend. Most of the criteria to evaluate the performance depend directly on length
    of the tracing process path from product usage life cycle. This paper proposed
    path algorithm using total effect rules from Kardaras and Karakostas (1999). The
    total effects for each factor should be evaluated to determine the influences
    on backward design tracing process, and then it is calculated using max-min inference
    approach. Thus, food product problem tracing path determines a series of activities
    that need to deliver a value chain service in FSC. I suppose the causal values
    are given by {a little ≦ often ≦ some ≦ much ≦ a lot}. The total effect of a cause
    variable Ⅰ on effect variable Ⅱ, denoted by T(Ⅰ,Ⅱ), is the sum of all the indirect
    effects from all the possible paths connecting Ⅰ with Ⅱ. In order to describe
    the degree of the relationship between causes, it is possible to use fuzzy linguistic
    terms, such as “a little” [0 ∼ 0.2], “often” (0.2 ∼ 0.4], “some” (0.4 ∼ 0.6],
    “much” (0.6 ∼ 0.8], “a lot”(0.8 ∼ 1], etc. According to the total-effect algorithm,
    for example, the total-effect T(I, IV) of some causal paths from I to V are E1(I,IV):
    (I, II, III, IV), E2(I,IV): (I, III, IV), E3(I,IV): (I, II, IV). . So the some
    indirect effects of I to IV are: In words, I (Farmer) imparts often causality
    to IV (distributor). According to the above-mentioned calculated process, we can
    obtain total effects of causal path in Table 5. The highest and lowest causal
    effects are found in the path from I to VI, and I to VI, II in Table 5. From the
    highest value of total effects, the two most significant factors are “farmer”
    and “customer”, respectively. In particular, when taking into consideration the
    factors “farmer” and “customer”, it can be immediately noted that they include
    the relationship management which are the most significant in improving the decision-making
    efficiency for food product problem tracing in the FSC. Therefore, we can conclude
    that total effects of two factors may affect the retailer and customer most favorably
    (>=0.5). Thus, these two factors are used to take as correctly identified item
    for measure metric. Table 5. Total effects of causal path. Causal path Total effects
    Bounded values Description Path 1:I--> III (VI→III) Often 0.4 I (farmer) imparts
    often causality to III (processor) Path 2:I--> IV (VI→IV) Often 0.3 I (farmer)
    imparts often causality to IV (distributor) Path 3:I--> II (VI→II) Often 0.3 I
    (farmer) imparts often causality to II (producer) Path 5:I--> V Some 0.5 I (farmer)
    imparts some causality to V (retailer) Path 5:I--> VI (VI→VI) Much 0.7 I (farmer)
    imparts much causality to VI (customer) The experiments are conducted by utilizing
    metrics in the case study. In this paper, evaluation of identification is defined
    as the probability that the F1-metric obtained through ATFCM and total effects
    algorithm of the proposed approach corresponds to benefits of traceability upstream
    FSC. These benefits consist of five alternatives such as: increase in customer
    satisfaction (#1), improvement in food crises management (#2), and improvement
    in FSC competence development (#3), technological and scientific contribution
    (#4) and contribution to agricultural sustainability (#5). Every benefit is repeatedly
    executed by ATFCM and total effects algorithm. In the F1-metric method, three
    metrics such as precision, recall and F1, are commonly used to measure the quality
    of identification. These are also used measures in information retrieval (Salton
    & McGill, 1983). An identification method may identify considering or not considering
    factor (tracing stage upstream FSC). The recall-metric indicated the effectiveness
    of a method for identifying considering tracing stage. The precision-metric represented
    the extent to which the tracing stage identified by a method really is considered.
    The F1-metric could be used to balance the tradeoff between precision and recall
    (Van, 1979). Recall is the fraction of considering tracing stage items that can
    be identified. (6) Precision is the fraction of identified tracing stage (predicted
    to be considering) that are really identified to be considering. (7) where, the
    considering item represented by six stages (Vi) upstream FSC, the identified item
    represented by new next state Vi(j) (>=0.5) from state-transition algorithm and
    the correctly identified item represented by tracing path Vi→j (>=0.5) from total
    effects algorithm. F1 metric assigned equal weight to precision and recall. (8)
    The identification quality by above-mentioned three metrics is compared with three
    approaches such as the proposed ATFCM approach, traditional FCM approach and forward-based
    FCM approach. The traditional FCM approach is so-called normal product development
    procedure using inference process of FCM and total effect algorithm. The forward-based
    FCM approach is so-called forward design using inference process of FCM and total
    effect algorithm. Table 6 shows the result by calculated the above-mentioned three
    metrics equation based on these data of five benefits. The average of F1 metrics
    of proposed approach exceeded those of traditional FCM approach and forward-based
    FCM approach. The proposed approach yields better identification. This result
    implies that proposed approach is more effective for food product problem tracing
    upstream FSC simultaneously. Summarizing, experimental results showed that the
    proposed ATFCM reasoning of the impact of food product problem tracing system
    can be effective. Table 6. Quality of identifications for three approaches. Alternatives

    in upstream FSC by three approaches for F1 metric. Experiments were also performed
    on placing six tracing stages into five benefits of traceability. Fig. 12 compares
    the F1 metrics of the three approaches effects that tracing stages are considered
    in FSC traceability. The proposed approach outperformed the traditional FCM and

    problem traceability system for backward design in the food supply chain is a
    complex task. Several problems exist at different stages throughout the FSC such
    as product quality and safety problem. The use of new technologies like IoT and
    software agent can be a very powerful tool for e-tracing information exchange
    between food supply chain actors. The EPCglobal based on IoT has provided interrelated
    standards for hardware, software and data interfaces, along with the food product
    problem tracing services using RFID and WSN technologies in order to support the
    FSC. The use of IoT and software agent have several benefits, like reduction of
    tracing time and autonomous operation for food product problem tracing system.
    Use of an object-oriented relational database management system to record information
    and class hierarchy diagram for linking of this tracing information between different
    parties can simplify the record-keeping and information exchange. We demonstrated
    the robust ATFCM algorithms of the state-transition and total effect by FCM. Moreover,
    the paper outlines ATFCM implementations in the food agriculture supply chain,
    to highlight the use of autonomous tracing operation in conjunction with integrated
    framework allowing collect, store and display the data from the stages of upstream
    FSC. The integrated framework focuses on analyzing and feeding the problem-causes
    to appropriate departments. The proposed tracing systems for efficient and knowledge
    based handling of problem-solving in backward deign of food need further improvement.
    The actual ATFCM implementation for different food supply chain actors would provide
    a better real time insight into the food product problem tracing system. Summarily,
    this paper designs the autonomous agent-based tracing system based on IoT (internet
    of things) architecture using FCM and fuzzy rule method for product usage life
    cycle. The case study for agriculture food product is discussed. The proposed
    approach using FCM and fuzzy rule can be able to provide a contribution in assessing
    the most critical factors for backward design process such as IoT-based tracing
    system of product usage life cycle. Good complex intelligent tracing system must
    be provided a solution to the issue of evaluating the factors which are considered
    to affect the multi-attributes of design consideration simultaneously. This paper
    will enhance the quality of performance impact of problem-solving for backward
    design process efficiency in the autonomous tracing system. The proposed ATFCM
    was applied to a case study for industrial food product problem tracing system
    to show the feasibility and usefulness of the approach. In the future, dynamic
    simulation may thus become common in traceability systems to provide a means of
    making decisions based on explicitly formulated criteria though fuzzy handling.
    Future research directions include an approach to integrating FCMs with other
    quantitative approaches to improve the precision of tracing results. For example,
    fuzzy decision tree techniques can be used to identify a causal relationship and
    its strength from classified data on tracing and FCM inference can be used for
    the simulation to analyze different scenarios. 8. Results/findings The proposed
    approach using FCM and fuzzy rule can be able to provide a contribution in assessing
    the most critical factors for backward design process such as IoT-based tracing
    system of product usage life cycle. Based on the empirical case study and experiment
    result of this study, it is clear from experiment result that the proposed ATFCM
    reasoning of the impact of food product problem tracing system can be effective.

    IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu SECTION I. Introduction In the agricultural
    information developments, the information collection technology is indispensable
    to agricultural scientific research administration. The low-cost and high-intelligent
    equipments are used in the fields to improve the traditional agriculture. Precision
    agriculture is a management philosophy or approach to the farm and is not a definable
    prescriptive system. It identifies the critical factors where the yield is limited
    by controllable factors, and determines intrinsic spatial variability [1]. It
    is essentially more precise farm management made possible by modern technology.
    The variations occurring in crop or soil properties within a field are noted,
    mapped and then management actions are taken as a consequence of continued assessment
    of the spatial variability within that field. Conventional agriculture is practiced
    for uniform application of fertilizer, herbicide, insecticides, fungicides and
    irrigation, without considering spatial variability. To alleviate the ill-effects
    of over and under usage of inputs, the new concept of precision agriculture has
    emerged [2]. Site specific management to spatial variability of farm is developed
    to maximize crop production and to minimize environmental pollution and degradation.
    It leads to sustainable development. Spatially variable crop production to a large
    extent is technology-driven. The new tools applicable to precision agriculture
    are the advances in electronics and computers such as RS, GPS and GIS. The technology
    covers three aspects such as data collection, analysis or processing of recorded
    information and recommendations based on available information. In the coming
    years, it is expected that the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) will be used commonly
    in applications in consumer electronics, personal healthcare, toys and games,
    industrial control and monitoring, agriculture, etc. Considering the site of the
    sensor nodes with fairly high precision, the researchers use a planned network
    rather than a network with ad-hoc routing. WSN provides route diversity and multiple
    transmissions [3]. The authors demonstrate some of the value that a wireless sensor
    network might deliver to an agricultural setting. The total cost of ownership
    of a wireless network is lower than a wired network. The authors described a precision
    agriculture architecture based on WSN. They deployed a large-scale sensor network
    and acquired valuable experiences. The paper is very useful references for WSN
    applications in the intelligent agriculture field. However, they have a little
    bit weak points. They can gather the environmental information, but they are weak
    to control the environment of the field. The contributions of this paper are summarized
    as follows. The system architecture of the agriculture system is presented from
    the sensor node hardware in the bottom to management sub-system in the top and
    is evaluated in the real-deployment. The way to control the environment using
    the feedback from the gathered information is described in the paper. The paper
    gives the experiences of a real deployment in fields and the ideas to improve
    the system. SECTION II. The design of the agriculture system Based on wireless
    sensor networks The architecture of the precision agriculture system based on
    wireless sensor networks consists of the environmental monitoring nodes, base
    stations, communications systems, Internet access and the structure of monitoring
    hardware and software system. From Fig.1, it proposes a novel network structure
    which increase system scalability [4]. According to different functions, a large
    number of the different sensors can be placed in the field and constructed a self-organized
    network to monitor the value change including temperature, humidity, atmosphere,
    precipitation and soil PH value, etc. The collection data is send to the sink
    by wireless mode. The control center can send the control information to any node
    in the network. Likewise, the remote data could be transmitted to the control
    center with the sink. The system adopts the cluster topology and hierarchical
    routing protocols. All sensor nodes are divided to some cluster. Each cluster
    is equivalent to a relatively fixed self-organizing network. The nodes are divided
    into the common node and cluster-head node. The common nodes will collect the
    data which transmitted to the cluster-head node. The data is stored to the database.
    Expert decision support system processes and analyzes the data at the same time.
    Fig.1 The system architecture Show All A. The Hardware Design of Sensor Nodes
    Sensor node is the basic platform of wireless sensor networks. The sensor is made
    up of four parts, sensor node module, the processing module, wireless communication
    module and the power module. Sensor module is responsible for collecting temperature,
    humidity, light intensity and other parameters and data conversion module. The
    processor module controls the operation of the sensor nodes, stores and processes
    the collected data. Wireless communication module communicates with other nodes,
    exchanges control information and sends and receive data. The power modular provides
    the energy to the sensor module, processing module and wireless communication
    module. The hardware structure of the node is shown in Fig. 2, Fig2 The node hardware
    structure Show All B. The Hardware Design of Cluster-head Nodes The cluster-head
    node acquires the environment information itself. It receives signals from other
    sensor nodes, integrates and stores the data automatically [5]. In Fig. 3, the
    hardware of the cluster-head node can be divided into moisture sensor, A/D converter
    module, wireless communication module, LCD modules, and data storage and power
    supplies. The cluster-head nodes sends sensor signal to the signal processing
    circuit. After A/D conversion, the data will be transmitted to microprocessor
    and sorted [6]. If the cluster-head node sends the query to the nodes in the self-organized
    network, the relative node will return the data to the cluster-head node. The
    cluster-head node receives the data of each node which will be automatically stored
    in regular USB devices, and it can display relevant information in the LCD screen.
    Fig. 3 The structure of the cluster-head node Show All C. Remote Control System
    Remote control system completes the real-time information processing through the
    Internet network access systems, remote monitoring center and the interface display
    control management system. The system have the real-time information processing
    functions, such as a display measured parameters, data reporting, curve display,
    graph generation, data storage, fault statistics and statements, reports and printing
    [7]. System can achieve network connectivity with TCP/IP and communicate between
    the terminal node and central station. The data analysis and evaluation in system
    provides quality assessment for the agricultural environment. SECTION III. The
    design of System software A. The Software Architecture The software architecture
    of sensor node is divided into embedded OS kernel layer and API layer. Embedded
    module provides tasks, power management and communication protocol [7]. The kernel
    also provides a low-level node driver of all hardware devices. API layer provides
    sensor acquisition module and RF communication module. The software architecture
    of sensor node is shown in Fig. 4. Task debugging module controls the control
    flow throughout the operating system, which is mainly responsible for the initialization
    of the wireless sensor and the maintenance of the operating status. The power
    management module supports processor, RF transceiver, sensors and other parts
    of the state control of energy consumption [8]. Energy management is able to ensure
    that nodes wake up at the right time, run in the low-power mode and maximize the
    use of energy. Fig 4. The software architecture of the sensor node Show All B.
    The Function of WSN Protocol Wireless network communication protocol provides
    the wireless communication standards between the cluster-head nodes and nodes
    [9]. It achieves registration, sleep the node, data acquisition, device controller,
    parameter settings and debugging. 1) Registration When the nodes work on, the
    node registers MAC to the cluster-head node and accesses to the network subnet
    number. It is assigned to a child node ID. 2) The Node Sleep The cluster-head
    node sends a data packet to notify the next node sleep time. 3) Data Collection
    According to testing requirements, the cluster-head node assigns the task of data
    collection, such as temperature, humidity, light intensity and gas concentration.
    4) Equipment Control The cluster-head node analyzes the data and makes decision.
    The packet of control instructions is sent to the node. 5) Parameter Settings
    The cluster-head node sends the modified equipment parameters to the child nodes.
    6) Debugging It is the equipment development and debugging functions. C. Wireless
    Sensor Network Protocol Stack Software component is the gateway and sensor nodes.
    The function of gateway software is processing and management data from sensor
    nodes [10]. It mainly consists of the serial port communications software, RF
    communications software, command software and task management software. The operating
    system is TinyOS. The software of sensor node is to receive the instruction from
    the cluster-head node and send the data to the sensor gateway [11]. In Fig. 5,
    the wireless sensor network protocol stack consists of the physical layer, medium
    access control layer, network layer and other components. Application interface
    provide a simple software interface including the application sub-layer and device
    object, so the application layer achieves the management of the equipment. Fig.
    5 The protocol stack architecture Show All The function of the child node is relatively
    simple. It does not require complex data processing. The interface peripherals
    are relatively small. Node data transfer flow is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 The node
    data tranfer flow Show All Fig. 7 Flowchart diagram of host device control Show
    All Cluster-head node is the center of the entire system, all cluster-member nodes
    in the cluster nodes work smoothly under the management of cluster-head node.
    After the cluster-head node completes the network connection, it receives the
    data from each node and sends data via serial port to the embedded module [12].
    The processed data is sent to a remote control center through the network in Fig.
    7. SECTION IV. Prospect and challenge In the agricultural monitoring system, all
    nodes always work under the adverse environmental condition, so they are different
    from the design of the traditional sensor network. Due to a larger monitoring
    area of agricultural production, the sensor network has a large number of nodes
    while it ensures the cost of the network. The nodes will be scattered in various
    regions to achieve a comprehensive monitoring on agricultural field. Because the
    sensor node energy is limited, the possibility of node failure is very large.
    The monitoring system must solve the reliability problem. The lifetime of WSN
    depends on the failure of the sensor node. In short, the agricultural monitoring
    system must solve the following problem: A. The Large-scale High-density Network
    Structure The requirement of monitoring material movement in geographical space
    is intrinsic motivation of the sensor networks. Compared with the traditional
    mode base on radar or satellite, WSN has some unique technical advantages on a
    distributed multi-dimensional and multi-angle information processing [13]. It
    can significantly improve the signal noise ratio, reduce the possible exploration
    in the region, and eliminate shadows and blind spots. The network nodes must be
    a large-scale, high-density deployment method to keep monitoring the area coverage
    and connectivity [14]. A large number of nodes in the network will inevitably
    increase the cost which will affect the network in the practical application.
    The premise of agriculture application is to design an available and economic
    deployment mechanism for WSN. B. Data Processing and Node Energy Communication
    is the maximal energy consumption. Each node has data independent processing ability.
    It reduces network transmission cost by processing and extracting the original
    data. A well-designed network networking, data transfer and data integration algorithms
    are important to the lifetime of the network. C. The Network Redundancy and Tolerance
    The validity and accuracy of data in agricultural monitoring system is very important.
    The optimization of node distribution is studied to reduce the energy consumption
    and ensure the effective information acquisition in wireless sensor network. Network
    fault tolerance includes node failure detection and failure recovery. Node failure
    needs to locate. If each node has the portable GPS devices, it will inevitably
    increase the cost of the entire network. How to balance between the costs of network
    configuration and node failure detection is a problem to be solved. Node failure
    recovery adopts the replacement of the general failure of redundant nodes, but
    it needs to design the number and the location of redundant nodes. SECTION V.
    Conclusion This paper has described the design and implementation of a novel wireless
    sensor network for monitoring agricultural environment and evaluated the reactivity,
    robustness and longevity of the network in the field. Compared with the traditional
    agriculture, the system greatly improves agricultural production efficiency. In
    future, agriculture will face formidable challenges to provide adequate nutrition
    for people. Therefore, it is the right time to take decisions, how to increase
    agricultural productivity, as the developing countries have the lowest productivity
    for most of the food crops. It is obvious that the latest tools of science and
    technology are applied for sustainable and equitable distribution of natural resources.
    The new technology may be able to harness several possibilities in managing the
    farm sector precisely. Future work will focus on addressing the limitations of
    the current prototype in robustness of packet delivery and network longevity,
    and in guaranteeing network response to events of interest. We also plan to generalize
    our event-condition-action framework for programming reactive sensor networks.

  analysis: The paper introduces CrossVit, a novel wireless sensor network (WSN),
    which operates using MEMSIC products, that can effectively monitor and collect
    relevant data in vineyards. After being tested over two growing seasons in two
    Italian vineyards, the CrossVit system proved capable of monitoring the air temperature,
    air humidity, and solar radiation with varying canopy treatments. These site-specific
    management practices help maximize yield and quality while minimizing management
    costs. This research successfully demonstrates that WSNs are a viable and useful
    tool to aid in precision viticulture and could be easily adapted for implementation
    in other agricultural scenarios.

    \ A new wireless sensor network (WSN), called CrossVit, and based on MEMSIC \n\
    products, has been tested for two growing seasons in two vineyards in Italy. The\
    \ aims are \nto evaluate the monitoring performances of the new WSN directly in\
    \ the vineyard and \ncollect air temperature, air humidity and solar radiation\
    \ data to support vineyard \nmanagement practices. The WSN consists of various\
    \ levels: the Master/Gateway level \ncoordinates the WSN and performs data aggregation;\
    \ the Farm/Server level takes care of \nstoring data on a server, data processing\
    \ and graphic rendering; Nodes level is based on a \nnetwork of peripheral nodes\
    \ consisting of a MDA300 sensor board and Iris module and \nequipped with thermistors\
    \ for air temperature, photodiodes for global and diffuse solar \nradiation, and\
    \ an HTM2500LF sensor for relative humidity. The communication levels are: \n\
    WSN links between gateways and sensor nodes by ZigBee, and long-range GSM/GPRS\
    \ \nlinks between gateways and the server farm level. The system was able to monitor\
    \ the \nagrometeorological parameters in the vineyard: solar radiation, air temperature\
    \ and air \nhumidity, detecting the differences between the canopy treatments\
    \ applied. The \nperformance of CrossVit, in terms of monitoring and reliability\
    \ of the system, have been \nOPEN ACCESS \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7653 \n \n \nevaluated\
    \ considering: its handiness, cost-effective, non-invasive dimensions and low\
    \ \npower consumption. \nKeywords: wireless sensor network; canopy microclimate;\
    \ ZigBee; viticulture \n \n1. Introduction \nModern viticulture is one of the\
    \ most promising agricultural sectors where new technologies might \nbe implemented\
    \ (i.e., disease control, canopy management) to ensure high quality wine production,\
    \ \nlow management costs and good yield, to cope with the recent crisis in the\
    \ sector. The International \nOrganisation of Vine and Wine has recently published\
    \ its report of the global economic situation of the \nviticulture and wine market\
    \ in 2011, stating that the world vineyard area has decreased by 7.8 Mha \n(thousands\
    \ of hectares). In the European Union the reduction in vineyard area could be\
    \ between 50 and \n55 Mha, with the largest reductions in Greece, Italy and Portugal.\
    \ Quality is a critical factor for the \nsuccess of wine and therefore strict\
    \ control of the wine production process is of utmost importance [1]. \nPrecision\
    \ viticulture aims to maximize the oenological potential of vineyards. This is\
    \ especially true \nin regions where the high quality standards of the wine production\
    \ justify the adoption of site-specific \nmanagement practices to simultaneously\
    \ increase both quality and yield [2]. Furthermore, the  \nsite-specific management\
    \ practices, which are becoming increasingly common, are also oriented \ntowards\
    \ a sustainable viticulture in which the growers and winemakers have begun to\
    \ evaluate the \nimpact of their management practices on the environment both\
    \ for its preservation (i.e., save water) \nand to characterize their product\
    \ on the wine market [3]. \nBesides the prestige wines from historically suited\
    \ environments, quality products can be obtained \nin Italy in sites appropriate\
    \ for a modern and economically sustainable viticulture, such as the Veneto \n\
    Piave CDO area. In these situations, mechanized vine management systems can support\
    \ the \ncompetitiveness of wines able to satisfy a broad-based demand. \nNew Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network (WSN) technologies can be useful and efficient to provide remote\
    \ \nand real-time monitoring of variables involved in the grape and wine production\
    \ system. In a broad \nsense a WSN is composed of various sensor modules connected\
    \ to a node with radio modules that \ntransmit the data from nodes to a base station\
    \ where the data are stored.  \nA WSN integrates sensors, wireless communications,\
    \ embedded computing, micro-electromechanical \nsystems, microelectronics and\
    \ other technologies; it can monitor parameters in real-time, sense and \ngather\
    \ information from environments or objects, process the data and transmit the\
    \ required \ninformation to the users.  \nThe agricultural sector does not make\
    \ sufficient use of technology and informatics to support \nproduction practices.\
    \ Although progress has being made with regard to the deployment of sensors, \n\
    WSN, actuators and other electromechanical devices in agricultural settings, there\
    \ are still important \nareas of development that have not been sufficiently explored.\
    \ \nEmbedded systems and wireless technologies can, in the long run, reduce costs\
    \ and increase profits \nin countries with favorable year-round climates that\
    \ permit multiple harvests but which lack other \nessentials required to maximize\
    \ their potential [4]. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7654 \n \n \nThe application of a\
    \ WSN in viticulture might respond to the actual needs, although a complete cost\
    \ \nand performance analysis of these networks is fundamental to fully understand\
    \ their application \npotential. Indeed, the dimensions of a single sensor node\
    \ may vary from the size of a shoebox to a \nmicroscopically small particle, while\
    \ the cost of a single device may vary from hundreds of euros  \n(for networks\
    \ of very few but powerful nodes) to a few cents (for large-scale networks made\
    \ up of \nvery simple nodes) [5]. \nIn the last years many system deployments\
    \ and WSN architectures have been proposed and \npublished in the scientific literature\
    \ with different potential characteristics, especially with regard to \nprecision\
    \ farming applications, where energy efficiency, transmission performance as well\
    \ as the \neffectiveness of the application have shown that these tools could\
    \ make a contribution not only to \nresearch but also for the food industry. A\
    \ comprehensive review on the state of the art of WSNs in \nagriculture and the\
    \ food industry was written by Ruiz-Garcia et al. [6]. With regard to applications\
    \ in \nviticulture, Burrell et al. [7] described WSN applications and configurations\
    \ that can address different \npriorities in the vineyard, and Beckwith et al.\
    \ [8] implemented a WSN consisting of 65 motes that \ncollected temperature measurements\
    \ in a vineyard over one month. Some of these applications focused \non integration\
    \ of WSN for video-surveillance. Lloret et al. [9] showed that, in the agriculture\
    \ context, \nwireless technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth penalize energy\
    \ consumption, becoming a major \ndrawback when transmitting the images or video\
    \ sequences required by an identification system. A \nvideo-surveillance platform\
    \ called Integrated WSN Solution for Precision Agriculture was described \nand\
    \ proposed by Garcia-Sanchez et al. [10] to detect and identify intruders as well\
    \ as to oversee the \nproduction process. Very interesting studies have been conducted\
    \ by the Portuguese CITAB and \nUTAD institutes. Researchers have shown the feasibility\
    \ of a ZigBee-based WSN powered by batteries \nthat can be recharged with green\
    \ energy from three sources (solar power, wind power and hydro \npower) [11].\
    \ In addition, Peres et al. [12] developed the Intelligent Precision Agriculture\
    \ Gateway \n(iPAGAT), designed to provide the necessary middleware between locally\
    \ deployed sensor networks \nand a remote location within the whole-farm concept.\
    \ This solar-powered infrastructure runs an \naggregation engine that supplies\
    \ a local database with environmental data gathered by a locally \ndeployed ZigBee\
    \ wireless sensor network. Finally, Nadimi et al. [13] have developed a WSN system\
    \ \nwith the same hardware described in our paper, although with totally different\
    \ objectives. \nThis paper introduces a new WSN, called CrossVit, based on MEMSIC\
    \ products and tested for two \nyears in a vineyard in Northern Italy. The aims\
    \ are to: (i) evaluate the monitoring performances of the \nnew WSN directly in\
    \ the vineyard; (ii) collect air temperature, air humidity and solar radiation\
    \ data to \nsupport vineyard management, disease control and water management\
    \ practices; (iii) compare vine \ncanopy microclimate related to different training\
    \ and trellis systems (i.e., upwards or downwards shoot \nposition) or canopy\
    \ management practices (i.e., leaf removal, shoot pruning, etc.). \n2. Experimental\
    \ Section  \n2.1. System Deployment and Architecture \nThe WSN system proposed\
    \ is based on MEMSIC Technology devices and consists of three levels \n(Figure\
    \ 1). The Master/Gateway level (MGL) coordinates the WSN and performs data aggregation.\
    \ \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7655 \n \n \nThis level is associated with the Farm/Server\
    \ level (FSL) that is responsible for storing data on a \nserver, data processing\
    \ and graphic rendering. The MGL is constituted by a gateway composed of a \n\
    Mib520 and Iris device (Table 1) with a USB coupled to an Asus eeePC® connection\
    \ and utilized as \nreceiving station, data storage and node programming. The\
    \ FSL is a remote Linux Server with a \nmodem as receiving station. Nodes level\
    \ (NL) is based on a network of peripheral nodes consisting of \na MDA300sensor\
    \ board and Iris module. The MDA300 board is a generic platform for measurements\
    \ \nof analog and digital signals, with the option of providing a different power\
    \ supply to the sensors.  \nFigure 1. Illustration of the on-going implementation\
    \ of the in-field data  \nacquisition network. MGL = Master/Gateway Level; NL\

    \ all the data collection procedures and is based on a WSN technology to acquire\
    \ \nagrometeorological data inside the vineyard. The sensors installed on the\
    \ system include thermistors \nfor air temperature, photodiodes for global and\
    \ diffuse solar radiation, and an HTM2500LF sensor \n(Humirel, Toulouse, France)\
    \ for relative humidity. Wireless transmission between NL and MGL was \nobtained\
    \ using two Iris ZigBee modules (Table 1), connected to a MIB520 (forming the\
    \ gateway) and \nMDA300 (forming the node) respectively, with a frequency range\
    \ of 2.4 GHz, IEEE 802.15.4 and \nabout 100 m of coverage. In this scenario, levels\
    \ of communication coexist: WSN links between \ngateways and sensor nodes by ZigBee\
    \ (NL2MGL connections), and long-range GSM/GPRS links \nbetween gateways and the\
    \ server farm level (MGL2FSL connections). This paper reports a WSN \ndevelopment\
    \ based on a multi-level wireless network. The network consists of 12 nodes connected\
    \ to \nthree types of sensors (see Section 2.5: Sensors Equipment) that collect\
    \ agrometeorological data within \nthe canopy. Iris modules for transmission were\
    \ programmed using the TinyOS 2 platform. This \nplatform was chosen because it\
    \ is a well-developed open source system and in addition, resources are \navailable\
    \ on the Internet for the development of applications based on it. The architecture\
    \ of the \nimplemented WSN is a star network topology where every node interacts\
    \ only with the coordinator of \nthe network localized in the center of the star.\
    \ This is the simplest topology and allows the use of \nprotocols and algorithms\
    \ that are equally simple and easy to implement. \n2.2. Wireless Communication\
    \ \nAmong the available technologies for wireless communication: Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b),\
    \ Bluetooth \n(IEEE 802.15.1), ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4), the latter was chosen because\
    \ it provides a better \nperformance in terms of signal handling and cost. In\
    \ fact, in recent years the majority of applications in \nprecision agriculture\
    \ include ZigBee technology as hardware. This technology ensures greater simplicity\
    \ \nand lower costs than other technologies, including Bluetooth. Iris, developed\
    \ by MEMSIC Technology, \nis the ZigBee module used in the system. The module\
    \ characteristics are shown in Table 1. \n2.3. Gateway  \nThe gateway is a combination\
    \ of three separate modules: a Mib520, a mini PC (Asus eeePC®) and \na GSM/GPRS\
    \ modem. The first module provides USB connectivity to the Iris and MICA motes,\
    \ \nuseful for communicating with a personal computer and programming. It supplies\
    \ power to the device \nthrough the USB port. The programmer was provided with\
    \ a processor, ATMEGA16L, necessary to \nprogram the motes. TinyOS operating system\
    \ was installed in order to program the motes.  \nThe programmer is connected\
    \ via USB to a computer eeePC with Xubuntu Linux version and  \nTinyOS 2.1.0 installed.\
    \ Audiotel GSM/GPRS modem is connected to the eeePC to ensure \ncommunication\
    \ with the FSL. \nThe CrossVit gateway is powered by means of two 50 W peek solar\
    \ panels combined with a \nrechargeable battery, under the control of a voltage\
    \ supervision system. These solar panels charge two \n12 V/100 Ah lead-acid batteries.\
    \ The gateway is equipped with one weather proof quad–band \nGSM/GPRS antenna,\
    \ equipped with a 3 m RG178 low drop signal cable (impedance 50 Ω) with max. \n\
    attenuation of 0.3 dB, in order to ensure the MGL2FSL connections and one ZigBee\
    \ antenna (2.4 GHz \nOmni RA7” MMCX 5 dBi omni-directional antenna) for mote-gateway\
    \ communication (NL2MGL \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7657 \n \n \nconnections) placed\
    \ on a 3 m high post. The RJ-178B cable has a SMA male connector (antenna) and\
    \ a \nmale MMCX connector (mote). \n2.4. Node \nThe nodes are composed of the\
    \ Iris wireless module and MDA300 Sensorboard module. The MDA300 \nis a generic\
    \ measurements platform for analog and digital data acquisition. Its characteristics\
    \ are given in \nTable 1. The power supply consists of a 6 V/150 mA solar panels\
    \ combined with a 6 V/4.5 Ah lead acid \nbattery. A 5 V low-dropout DC/DC converter\
    \ has been added to adjust the battery voltage. The \nelements were contained\
    \ in a watertight case with IP 67 protection that was placed on a support inside\
    \ \nthe vine canopy, at the cordon level (Figure 2), while the solar panels were\
    \ installed on a 2 m mast \nabove the canopy.  \nFigure 2. Node Level. \n \n2.5.\
    \ Sensors Equipment \nThe wide availability of channels on the sensor board allowed\
    \ the implementation of a system with \na wide range of sensors (Table 2). Diffuse\
    \ solar radiation, temperature and air humidity were the main \nparameters chosen\
    \ for the aim of our study. After a detailed analysis of market products the node\
    \ \nsensors that have shown better performance in terms of resolution, accuracy,\
    \ response time, energy \nconsumption and overall cost were selected.  \n \n \n\

    \ is measured by two types of sensors placed inside a solar shield to avoid heating\
    \ \nby incident light and provide shock protection. Both were positioned under\
    \ the permanent vine row in \norder to monitor the microclimate inside the canopy.\
    \ The first sensor is an epoxy-thermistor composed \nof a micro-BetaCHIP device\
    \ 10 K 3MCD1 (Betatherm Sensors, Ballybrit Business Park, Galway, \nIreland) protected\
    \ by a plastic housing, which confers resistance to shock and moisture, without\
    \ losing \naccuracy and speed of measurement. The second sensor is the HTM2500LF,\
    \ a humidity and \ntemperature transducer designed for monitoring applications\
    \ where a reliable and accurate \nmeasurement is needed. The diffuse solar radiation\
    \ sensor used in the system is the same as that \nemployed on the NAV system.\
    \ It is a prototype consisting of a silicon photocell in a PVC support \nunder\
    \ a Teflon dome, which can simulate the diffuse component of radiation. Each peripheral\
    \ node is \nequipped with two radiation sensors, positioned inside the canopy\
    \ below and just above the permanent \nvine cordon. The sensor does not require\
    \ power supply, and provides an output signal as a continuous \nelectrical voltage\
    \ proportional to the amount of diffuse solar radiation. A calibration phase of\
    \ each \nsensor used in the WSN was performed for a period of 10 days in experimental\
    \ field conditions before \nsystem deployment in the vineyard. The wireless nodes\
    \ were allocated on a support at 20 m distance \nfrom the master station, and\
    \ the sensors were placed proximal to the reference sensors installed on a \n\
    CR1000 datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Inc.CSI, North Logan, UT, USA). Calibration\
    \ of the \ntemperature sensor (thermistor) and temperature and humidity sensor\
    \ (HTM2500LF) was done with \nthe HMP45C (Campbell Scientific), a temperature\
    \ and relative humidity probe containing a platinum \nresistance temperature detector\
    \ (PRTD) and a capacitive relative humidity sensor. The solar radiation \nsensor\
    \ (silicon photocell prototype) was calibrated with a global solar radiation sensor\
    \ EPPLEY (mod. \npsps.n.20298F3, The EPPLEY Laboratory, Inc., Newport, RI, USA).\
    \ Calibration was performed by \nacquiring data every 5 min for the duration of\
    \ the calibration phase, and transmitting data from each \nnode to the master\
    \ station at hourly intervals. \n \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7659 \n \n \n2.6. Software\
    \ Description and Integration \nNetwork management was performed by software based\
    \ on the TinyOS platform [14]. TinyOS is an \nopen source operating system based\
    \ on modules, designed specifically for WSN, developed by the \nnesC programming\
    \ language. Figure 3 shows the block diagram of the hardware connections and \n\
    software operation. \nFigure 3. Block diagram of the hardware connections and\
    \ software operation. \n \n2.6.1. NL Firmware \nThe sensor management program\
    \ was operating in “split-phase” mode, which is a technique that \nrealizes an\
    \ asynchronous communication between components and is used to perform operation\
    \ \nblockers of long duration, dividing the operation into two stages: (i) Invocation\
    \ (command ends \nimmediately) and (ii) Return the result (event notification).\
    \ The sample events are controlled  \nby a timer event Timer0.fired which calls\
    \ an asynchronous event sensor reading (void \nSensor_x_Read.readDone (error_t\
    \ err, uint16_t value)). At the beginning of the sensor reading \nprocedure, the\
    \ radio module starts AMControl.start and once the packet is transmitted \nAMControl.stop.\
    \ A Low Power Listening (LPL) mode is provided between reading sequences. With\
    \ \nLPL, the nodes are woken up at periodic intervals called check intervals when\
    \ they activate the radio \nand send the packet. Excitation commands were used\
    \ for temperature and humidity sensors at 2.5 V \nand 5 V via the GeneralIO interface\
    \ (e.g., instructions: GeneralIO as FIVE_VOLT) wired with the \ninterface MicaBusC\
    \ (e.g., instructions: App.FIVE_VOLT −> MicaBusC.PW5). The drivers used for \n\
    the implementation of the sensor board MDA300 in the TinyOS were developed ad-hoc\
    \ by  \nZheng et al. [15]. SensorMDA300ca is the configuration module which presents\
    \ all interfaces. A total \nof eight single-ended AD channels, eight differential\
    \ ended AD channels, and one digital IO channel \nare provided by this module.\

    \ 13 \n7660 \n \n \nSensorMDA300ca is the same. The command “read” can be invoked\
    \ to start the AD converter. A \n“readDone” event will be triggered after the\
    \ conversion is done. An interface from \n“sensorMDA300ca” has to be correctly\
    \ wired in the application according to the hardware connection. \nThe NL software\
    \ consists of three integrated codes for the signals acquisition from the sensors\
    \ and the \ntransmission in packets form to MGL: \n“RxAppAppC” was the component\
    \ configuration defined by assembling existing components \nprovided by TinyOS,\
    \ it is a global configuration that defines the connections between all its \n\
    components. “RxDataC” is the module that implements the interfaces exporting controls\
    \ and event \nhandlers. The application “RxDataC” needs to use four read interfaces\
    \ aliased as “sensor_0_read” to \n“sensor_3_read”. In the corresponding configuration\
    \ module, “RxDataAppC”, the four interfaces are \nwired to the interfaces provided\
    \ by “sensorMDA300ca”. The interface number to be chosen from \n“sensorMDA300ca”\
    \ is determined by the physical connection port a sensor is wired in. Each data\
    \ \npacket that comes out of the mote contains several fields of data (uint 16).\
    \ The data payload of the \nmessage is defined in “RxData.h”. The overall message\
    \ format for the application is as follows \n• \nNode ID (2 bytes) \n• \nCounter\
    \ (2 byte) \n• \nPayload (20bytes): \n• \nADC data readings (8 readings of 2 bytes\
    \ each) \n• \nBattery voltage (2 bytes) \n2.6.2. MGL Firmware \nThe basic TinyOS\
    \ utility application BaseStation (BaseStationP.nc, BaseStationC.nc) is used in\
    \ \norder to receive data from the gateway. It acts as a bridge between the serial\
    \ port and radio network. \nWhen it receives a packet from the serial port, it\
    \ transmits it on the radio; when it receives a packet \nover the radio, it transmits\
    \ it to the serial port. Because TinyOS has a toolchain for generating and \n\
    sending packets to a mote over a serial port using a BaseStation, it allows PC\
    \ tools to communicate \ndirectly with mote networks. This module was loaded into\
    \ the Iris wireless module connected to \nMib520. TinyOS also provides a set of\
    \ APIs and tools to build applications that interact with the \nsensor network\
    \ (API Java, Parser package). The “RxDataMsg.java” application is a class that\
    \ \nimplements a Java interface to the “RxDataMsg” and all the message specifications,\
    \ for example the \nsize. Finally, the application “Msgreader.java” is a method\
    \ for the data management and reception of \nall messages, sent from the mote\
    \ connected to the USB port. This method performs a series of \noperations when\
    \ it receives a message of “DataMsg” type, containing the nodes sensor data: \n\
    (1) data conversion from count to mv (* 2.5/4096); \n(2) data calibration using\
    \ cross-calibration span and offset; \n(3) printing out the packets coming from\
    \ the mote on the Gateway; \n(4) saving each package in an ASCII file. \n \n \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n7661 \n \n \n2.6.3. FSL Firmware \nTo access the MGL, equipped\
    \ with a Linux Asus eeePc, a direct connection must first be \nestablished from\
    \ the FSL. This is accomplished with a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connection.\
    \ On \nthe Master side Mgetty was used, a versatile program to handle all aspects\
    \ of a modem under Unix \nbased systems. The Mgetty program opens a serial device,\
    \ configures it appropriately, configures the \nmodem, and waits for a connection\
    \ to be made. When a connection is detected, Mgetty issues a login \nprompt, and\
    \ then invokes the login program to handle the actual system login. At this point\
    \ the user \nhas complete control of the Master PC, can view log files to check\
    \ for system integrity, access \nindividual data files from every node, and even\
    \ retrieve data files. \n2.7. Field Experiment \nThe CrossVit system was tested\
    \ in Veneto Region (North-East Italy) by the National Council for \nAgricultural\
    \ Research CRA. The trial was conducted on two commercial vineyards (Ponte di\
    \ Piave and \nSan Nicolò) owned by Le Rive farm, located in the province of Treviso.\
    \ In the first vineyard the Vitis \nvinifera variety was cv Pinot gris grafted\
    \ on SO4, and in the second one Cabernet Sauvignon grafted \non 1103 P, both were\
    \ planted in 2002. Both vineyards, which are located on silty-clay soils, are\
    \ trellis \ntrained with free cordon with spur pruning and have an irrigation\
    \ system. For both varieties two \ndifferent methods of winter pruning have been\
    \ used, which allow the comparison between three \ntreatments: \na. \nNP: no pruning;\
    \ \nb. PM: mechanical pruning; \nc. \nPMa: manual pruning \nFor grape quality\
    \ and health of bunches it is very important to study the varietal adaptability\
    \ to \ndifferent training systems and pruning methods, the two varieties were\
    \ chosen for their skin color and \nhabitus: high vigor and fast growth for Cabernet\
    \ Sauvignon and low vigor for Pinot gris. The \nmicroclimate inside the canopy\
    \ is one of the most useful parameters to study given its effect on grape \ncolor,\
    \ sugar and aroma compounds accumulation. The vines were spaced 0.95 m and 1.3\
    \ m apart for \nPinot gris and Cabernet Sauvignon respectively, while row spacing\
    \ was 2.5 m for both varieties. The \nsingle wire was 1.5 m high and the shoots\
    \ positioning was free because there were no other wires or \ncatch wires above\
    \ the permanent cordon \nThe trial was conducted over two growing seasons from\
    \ April to September (2011 and 2012). The \nnode sensors were positioned inside\
    \ the vineyards, adopting an experimental layout representing the \nsix treatments\
    \ (two varieties and NP, PM and PMa pruning), with two replicates for each sensor\
    \ and \ntreatment (in total two main stations and six nodes each). The temperature,\
    \ humidity and solar \nradiation sensors were positioned inside the canopy as\
    \ follows: \n• \nTemperature sensor just above the permanent cordon; \n• \nSolar\
    \ radiation sensor placed below (20 cm) the permanent cordon; \n• \nHumidity sensors\
    \ inside the canopy in the same position as the solar radiation sensor. \n \n\
    \ \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7662 \n \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Power Management\
    \ Performances \nThe energy consumption test, for both MGL and NL, was done in\
    \ the laboratory (Table 3). The \nnode performed the reading of the sensors (75\
    \ mA peak) every 15 minutes and sent data to the gateway \n(6 mA peak). The increased\
    \ energy consumption in the reading phase was due to the 5 s. excitation \nneeded\
    \ by the HTM2500 sensors. The nodes were equipped with a full capacity 4,500 mA\
    \ battery, \ntherefore to estimate the available battery life, 60% of capacity\
    \ was considered (3,000 mAh), giving an \nestimated autonomy of approximately\
    \ 21 days. This autonomy appears to be optimal in a field \napplication to ensure,\
    \ in case of problems with solar charge, enough time to replace the batteries.\
    \ \nRegarding the gateway, the Asus eeePC consumed 900 mA. Fortunately, in the\
    \ field tests it was not \nnecessary to replace batteries, thanks to the solar\
    \ panel charge and the high number of sunny days \nduring the summer period. \n\

    The transmission test was done in the laboratory before the field test using the\
    \ Received Signal \nStrength Indication (RSSI) parameter and then directly in\
    \ the vineyards to verify the signal and to map \nthe vineyard to ensure a good\
    \ displacement of the nodes. It is a measure of the signal power on the \nradio\
    \ link, usually in dBm units, while a message is being received. It can be used\
    \ for estimating node \nconnectivity and node distance (although the relationship\
    \ between distance and RSSI is noisy and not \nstraightforward). Another use of\
    \ RSSI is to sample the channel power when no node is transmitting to \nestimate\
    \ the background noise, also known as noise floor. \nThe RSSI values given by\
    \ TinyOS are usually not in dBm units, and should be converted by the \nplatform-specific\
    \ relationship to obtain meaningful data. In our field test we needed to have\
    \ an \nindicator of the area with the minimum coverage sufficient for reception\
    \ by the gateway of all packets \nsent by the nodes and not a parameter in absolute\
    \ terms. The values range for RSSI values is 0–100, \nmore distant, lower is this\
    \ values, in fact, a high value means good packet reception, while a low value\
    \ \nassociated with a poor reception. The ping program sent the RSSI value continuously\
    \ (every second) \nfrom the node connected to the gateway, and allowed a coverage\
    \ map to be drawn of the network with \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7663 \n \n \nRSSI levels.\
    \ The isosignal lines associated with threshold values of RSSI and the position\
    \ of the nodes \nare shown in Figure 4(a–b). All the nodes were then placed inside\
    \ the area of >25 RSSI to allow a \ngood data reception. The RSSI value measured\
    \ in the field installation was not very high even at \nrelatively short distances,\
    \ due to the fact that the leaf canopy interfered with the transmission range.\
    \ Tx \nerrors were measured in terms of received data packages/sent data packages\
    \ ratio resulting a value \nequal to 1 within the >25 RSSI value, while the ratio\
    \ falls rapidly away from the 25 RSSI isosignal. \nFigure 4. (a) Data transmission\
    \ test at San Nicolò vineyard. The isosignal lines represent \nthe RSSI values;\
    \ (b) Data transmission test at Ponte di Piave vineyard. The isosignal lines \n\
    represent the RSSI values. \n \n3.3. Agricultural Results \nThe field applications\
    \ of CrossVit systems have shown good monitoring performance in both \nvineyards.\
    \ The two systems were able to monitor the agrometeorological parameters in the\
    \ vineyards: \nsolar radiation, air temperature and air humidity, detecting the\
    \ differences between the canopy \ntreatments applied. In particular, the PMa\
    \ treatment has shown the higher values of air temperature \ninside the canopy\
    \ than the other two canopy management treatments in both vineyards, despite the\
    \ \ndifferent grapevine varieties having a typical trellis (Figure 5).  \nFigure\
    \ 5. Daily cycle of air temperature (max) (°C) at the two vineyards A (Ponte Piave)\
    \ \nand B (San Nicolò) in the three field treatments applied: NP, no pruning (gray\
    \ dotted line); \nPM mechanical pruning (gray solid line); PMa manual pruning\
    \ (black dotted line). Master \n(black solid line) is the air temperature measured\
    \ outside the vineyard. All the values are \nhourly averages of two years of observations\

    \ (black dotted line). Master \n(black solid line) is the solar radiation measured\
    \ outside the vineyard. All the values are \nhourly averages of two years of observations\
    \ from April to September. \n \nFigure 7. Daily cycle of relative air humidity\
    \ (%) at the two vineyards (A) (Ponte Piave) \nand (B) (San Nicolò) in the three\
    \ field treatments applied: NP, no pruning (gray dotted \nline); PM mechanical\
    \ pruning (gray solid line); PMa manual pruning (black dotted line). \nMaster\
    \ (black solid line) is the relative humidity measured outside the vineyard. All\
    \ the \nvalues are hourly averages of two years of observations from April to\
    \ September. \n \nAs concerns solar radiation, the NP canopy management has been\
    \ shown to receive less solar \nradiation in both sites (Figure 6). In accordance\
    \ with these observations, the relative humidity in the \nPMa canopy was the lowest\
    \ (Figure 7). In both sites and for all agrometeorological parameters, values\
    \ \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7665 \n \n \nrecorded by the Master station were always\
    \ higher compared with the Node values, consistently with \nthe fact that the\
    \ Master station was installed outside the vineyards without foliage coverage.\
    \ \nThese two seasons’ results indicated a satisfactory reliability of CrossVit\
    \ systems in monitoring \nmicrometeorological parameters and detecting the different\
    \ canopy management effects. The CrossVit \nperformance was evaluated considering\
    \ the specific aims of this study: \n1. \nHandiness: the solution had to be ready\
    \ for use and easy to install; the installation was simply \nprovided with two\
    \ screws to the cordon pole. \n2. \nCost-effective: the cost of hardware, software\
    \ and sensors had to be very low; the cost for a \nsingle complete node was approximately\
    \ 300 euro. \n3. \nNon-invasive dimensions: the nodes of the WSN had to permit\
    \ the operations in the vineyard \nand not affect the surrounding environment;\
    \ the case including the node and solar panel \ndimensions were 20 × 25 cm and\
    \ 8 × 12 cm respectively. \n4. \nVersatile and expandable: the system was developed\
    \ for monitoring in the vineyard, but could \nbe used for a wide range of applications\
    \ and with the possibility of adding new types of sensors \nwith small changes\
    \ of the firmware (i.e., irrigation schedule); \n5. \nLow power consumption: the\
    \ system should have low consumption in terms of energy supply \nand fully rechargeable\
    \ with a small solar panel. \n6. \nFirmware and software of the system must be\
    \ developed in open source environments. \nThe CrossVit system is still being\
    \ evaluated in the vineyards, but it has already been shown to have \nachieved\
    \ many of the set goals. The results in terms of power supply and data transmission\
    \ in the two \nseasons confirmed the reliability of the system. The agronomic\
    \ results have shown the capability of \nCrossVit systems in monitoring micrometeorological\
    \ parameters. However some weak points of the \nsystems were identified, in particular,\
    \ the high energy consumption of the receiving station data (Asus \neeePc) and\
    \ the quite complicated management software (TinyOS).  \nRegarding the first weak\
    \ point, future development will be the implementation of the MGL based \non an\
    \ Arduino platform with the TinyOS operating system that promises a much lower\
    \ energy \nconsumption, even if having a PC in the field enabled the control of\
    \ data supply chain and real time \ndisplay, which was very useful. Studies on\
    \ WSNs for agricultural application used different types of \nhardware and were\
    \ often only aimed at a test run or concerned monitoring for few days in the \
    \ \nfield [13–16]. The present CrossVit system was tested in the vineyards for\
    \ two seasons in analogy with \nthe work of the Portuguese research team that\
    \ started in 2008 [11] and then evolved as described in \nPeres et al. [12]. Our\
    \ vineyards monitoring projects began in 2009 with the NAV system, which had \n\
    good flexibility characteristics but weaknesses in terms of price and the proprietary\
    \ software. \n4. Conclusions \nA new WSN application for real-time monitoring\
    \ of vineyards is presented. The CrossVit system \nallowed two WSN to be implemented\
    \ in two vineyards with different pruning treatments in order to \nunderstand\
    \ whether the system could discriminate the effects of the treatments on the microclimate.\
    \ \nThis system has allowed us to collect data on the state of the crop with real\
    \ time microclimate \nmonitoring, not only for research purposes, but also for\
    \ controlling events of management interest, such \nSensors 2013, 13 \n7666 \n\
    \ \n \nas early disease detection. The system was able to monitor the agrometeorological\
    \ parameters in the \nvineyard: solar radiation, air temperature and air humidity,\
    \ detecting the differences between the canopy \ntreatments applied. This research\
    \ has helped to demonstrate the feasibility of using WSNs for technical \napplications\
    \ in precision viticulture. The methodology focuses on the monitoring of vineyards\
    \ as a \nreference case but, with minor changes, it could be applied directly\
    \ to other agricultural scenarios. \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors are grateful\

  analysis: 'The paper provides a novel hybrid routing protocol based on Rapid Spanning
    Tree (RST) and Cluster Head (CH) routing for data aggregation in agricultural
    applications. This protocol aims to optimize energy consumption and reduce network
    convergence time, especially in scenarios where topology changes occur. The paper
    presents simulation results demonstrating the protocol''s superior performance
    in terms of convergence time and energy consumption compared to traditional Spanning
    Tree - CH Routing (CHR-STP).


    Specifically, the paper highlights the following contributions relevant to the
    point of different data types and their collection and use:


    * **Data aggregation:** The proposed hybrid routing protocol efficiently aggregates
    data from heterogeneous sensors deployed in agricultural fields. The cluster-based
    architecture leverages CHs to collect data from sensing nodes within a cluster
    and relay it to the sink through a spanning tree constructed using RST. This efficient
    data aggregation mechanism ensures timely and reliable data delivery.

    * **Topology management:** RST is incorporated into the protocol to handle topology
    changes caused by node failures or energy depletion. RST''s rapid transition of
    port/channel states enables faster network convergence, minimizing data loss and
    ensuring uninterrupted data collection.

    * **Energy conservation:** The hybrid protocol optimizes energy consumption by
    reducing the number of packets required for network convergence and reconfiguration.
    This is particularly important in agricultural applications where sensors have
    limited energy resources and need to operate for extended periods.


    Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the use of different data types
    in agricultural applications and proposes an innovative routing protocol that
    addresses the challenges of data aggregation, topology management, and energy
    efficiency in this context.'

    the plants for real time, such as air temperature, soil water content, and nutrition
    stress. This real time information will provide a solid base for farmers to adjust
    the strategies at any time. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination
    protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs. The focus, however, has been
    given to routing protocols which might differ depending on the application and
    network architecture. In this paper, authors present a novel hybrid routing technique
    for data aggregation in agricultural applications. This efficient data aggregation
    hybrid protocol is based on Rapid Spanning Tree and Cluster Head routing which
    has an advantage of faster convergence during self organization and a topology
    change, thereby minimizing the energy consumed. Further, this hybrid protocol
    uses clustering within the clusters and chooses cluster-heads; cluster-head is
    responsible for receiving, sending and maintaining information in its cluster.
    Then all cluster-heads will construct a spanning tree to establish the communication
    with the sink. The simulation using ns-2 confirms the faster convergence and reduced
    energy consumption with heterogeneous sensor nodes. Published in: 2010 INTERNATIONAL

    India SECTION I Introduction This Recent Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly
    considered by the scientific community as the future of Environmental Monitoring.
    Providing at a low cost, the possibility to gather and process all sorts of data
    with a space and time resolution unimaginable before, these networks are viewed
    as a critical element of the revolution of ubiquitous computing. WSNs have been
    used for Data aggregation in numerous applications including military surveillance,
    facility monitoring, precision agriculture and environmental monitoring. Typically
    WSNs have a large number of sensor nodes with the ability to communicate among
    themselves and also to an external sink or a base-station [1], [2]. WSN in agriculture
    field should be self organized. The term self organization is used to define the
    development of a system-wide adaptive structure and functionality from simple
    local interactions between individual entities. In a structure, the entities are
    arranged in a particular manner and interact with each other in some way. Functionality
    means that the overall system fulfils a certain purpose, for example, a school
    of small fish uses a group structure to protect themselves against predators.
    Self organization is all about the behavior of individual entities at a microscopic
    level which result in an overall system behavior at a macroscopic level. This
    is called emergent-behavior [4]. The WSN deployed in Agriculture field should
    have an emergent-behavior. In a multi-hop sensor network, communication nodes
    are usually scattered in the field with each of the scattered nodes having the
    capability to collect and route data via a wireless medium. WSNs in Agriculture
    field needs to be scalable since some nodes may be in inhospitable terrains and
    hence inaccessible. Secondly sensor networks must be robust and operate in very
    different environments with the ability to adapt to changes in the environment
    [2]. One such environment where the role of sensor networks is actively developing
    is Precision Agriculture. However, sensor nodes have constraints with energy supply
    and bandwidth. Such constraints combined with a typical deployment of large number
    of sensor nodes in a farm have posed many challenges to the design and management
    of sensor networks. These challenges necessitate energy-awareness at all layers
    of networking protocol stack [6]. At the network layer, the main aim is to find
    ways for energy-efficient route setup and reliable relaying of data from the sensor
    nodes to the sink so that the lifetime of the agriculture sensor network can be
    maximized. In this paper, authors present a Novel Hybrid Routing Protocol based
    on Rapid spanning tree and Cluster head routing for Data Aggregation especially
    in Agricultural Applications to prolong network lifetime by minimizing the energy
    consumption. SECTION II Background and Motivation Agriculture is by far the human
    activity that uses the most of freshwater resources (65–70%). Worldwide, only
    17% of the croplands are irrigated, but they account for 40 % of the global harvest.
    Poor farmers around the globe, who survive on rain fed farming, would more than
    double their average crop yield if they could use irrigation. Considerable volume
    of water is wasted due to inadequate irrigation management, which can also lead
    to water-logging or to soil salinisation. A proper environmental monitoring system
    for water management in agriculture has demanding requirements. Because of the
    spatial and time variability of the relevant parameters, continuous monitoring
    at several locations are necessary. The sub urban areas of Coimbatore, TamilNadu
    State has an average bore well level at 300m where depth of bore wells in the
    state generally varies from 30–100m. This is far higher than the state average
    bore well depth. This demands Wireless sensor networks with lightweight sensing
    and communication system which in turn necessities Energy efficient network configuration,
    network maintenance and Data aggregation for monitoring the farm land. There are
    no examples for commercial applications to date. However, in recent years a number
    of investigations have been conducted by scientists in realistic agricultural
    settings. A Irrigation Management As the limits of groundwater exploitation are
    being reached, farmers are now beginning to invest in micro-irrigation technologies
    to conserve water. The cost of these technologies has been declining. For example,
    the cost of trickle (or drip) irrigation equipment (as in Figure 1) is US 0.03persquaremeterorUS
    300 per hectare, which is easily affordable for those growing high-valued crops,
    and the equipment can be manufactured locally. This means that this technique
    is becoming attractive even for small farmers, as trickle irrigation can improve
    water usage efficiency by up to 60 to 80%, compared to traditional surface irrigation
    techniques. Micro-irrigation efficiency depends on the adjustment of water provided
    to the plant and water demand of the plant. The improved environmental information
    is instrumental to its successful implementation, especially in a demand-based
    system. A likely method is to determine significant thresholds in soil moisture
    as a function of soil, crop type and crop growth stage, and to monitor the soil''s
    water content in order to know when to add water and how much to add. Figure 1.
    Drip Irrigation system used in Agriculture. Show All B Vineyard Temperature Monitoring
    In [7] Burrell et al reported on the use of sensor networks for integrated management
    of a vineyard. Using an ethnographic approach, they first assessed the needs of
    vineyard managers before designing and deploying a system in the field. C Potato
    Disease Prevention In [8], Baggio presented the results of the Lofar project in
    monitoring of microclimates in a crop field. The deployed WSN monitored humidity
    and temperature in order to better fight the phytophtora in a potato field. D
    Paddy Field Monitoring In [9], Hirafuji et al. developed the concept of Field-Monitoring
    Server, a Wi-Fi based wireless sensing platform that was used for various Earth
    observation, urban image monitoring and agriculture. They report on the deployment
    of a network of five nodes in paddy fields. Taking an agnostic approach to the
    current view on WSNs, the agricultural monitoring systems need enhanced capabilities.
    Demand for Deployment of Wireless sensor network (WSN) in agriculture is because
    of its small size, low fixed cost and simplicity of wiring. For example, typical
    wiring in industrial applications has an average cost of 130− 150 per meter but
    employing a wireless sensor technology eliminates 20–60% of that cost. SECTION
    III Wireless Sensor Network Architecture The low cost sensors are deployed in
    the farm field to sense the environment. The High speed communication devices
    (hence forth called as routers) are deployed in the borders of the farm field.
    The sensors communicate with the routers through cluster head routing protocol
    and routers will in turn create a spanning tree to cascade the data to the sink.
    Figure 2 shows the group of heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    farm. Sensor nodes will have sensing capability with limited communication capability
    and having minimal coverage range. The Cluster heads are the nodes having higher
    computation and communication capabilities. Sensors and cluster-heads are assumed
    to be stationary or limitedly moving inside clusters. Sensors receive commands
    from and send data to its cluster-head, which does preprocessing of the data and
    forward them to other cluster-heads. A cluster-head is located within the communication
    range of all the sensors of its cluster and can communicate with its neighbor
    cluster-heads. A cluster-head forwards traffic to other cluster-heads with longer
    distance as compared to its sensing nodes. In some applications it is more powerful
    than the sensing nodes in terms of energy, bandwidth and memory, while others
    select cluster-heads from the deployed sensors. When a cluster-head is under failure
    due to insufficient power, another cluster-head will be selected among the sensors
    (assume a sensor can adjust its transmission power to a larger value once it is
    selected as a cluster-head.). The cluster-based architecture raises many interesting
    issues such as cluster formation, cluster-head selection and cluster maintenances,
    which are beyond the scope of this work. Here, authors focus on modeling the traffic
    behavior along with the multi-hop cluster-heads using Rapid spanning tree. Figure
    2. Senor Network deployed in Farm Field. Show All SECTION IV Proposed Hybrid Routing
    Protocol A System model Consider a multi-hop WSN consisting of M clusters arranged
    as shown in Fig. 3. Cluster i has ni sensing nodes and a cluster head which is
    used for management and relaying. (where i =1, 2 … M). The distance between the
    sink and the 1st cluster is d1and between the jthcluster and the ith cluster is
    dij. A cluster-head not only collects data from the sensing nodes of its cluster
    but also relays collected data from other cluster head [2]. This many-to-one data
    routing paradigm leads to non-uniform traffic distribution in different clusters
    of the WSN. The cluster-heads closer to the sink transfer more traffic than those
    located at farther region. The protocol sequence consists of five parts at high
    level: Attaching to cluster-head: Dynamic attachment of nodes to the cluster head
    according to the transmission signal strength of the cluster head which in turn
    depends on the residual energy in the cluster head. Constructing Spanning Tree:
    Construction of spanning tree using RST to achieve maximum lifetime and to minimize
    the tree convergence time. Sensing: Sensors around the target area are responsible
    for probing the target/event and to send the collected data to their cluster-head.
    Data Forwarding: Collected data are transmitted through the cluster-heads by Rapid
    spanning tree until to the sink. Sink: Sink performs system-level data analysis
    and provides overall situation awareness. B Energy Computation For a simplified
    power model of radio communication, the energy consumed per second, the key challenges
    in unlocking the potential of transmission, is E t (i)=( e t + e d  r n )B (1)
    View Source Where et is the energy/bit consumed by the transmitter electronics
    and ed accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp (including op-amp
    inefficiencies). Both et and ed are properties of the transceiver used by the
    nodes, r is the transmission range used. The parameter n is the power index for
    the channel path loss of the antenna. This factor depends on the RF environment
    and is generally between 2 and 4. B is the bit rate of the radio and is a fixed
    Topology management provides the distributed parameter. On the receiving side,
    a fixed amount of power is required to capture the incoming radio signal. E r
    (j)= e r  B (2) View Source er is the energy/bit consumed by the receiver electronics
    used by the node. Energy consumed by one-hop communication in a finite one dimensional
    network from the ith cluster-head to the jthcluster-head across a distance dijis,
    E t (i,j)=( e t + e d  d   n ij ) BA i (3) View Source The jth cluster-head as
    the receiver, the power consumed by this communication is then simply E r (j,i)=
    e r  B A i (4) View Source By combining Eq. (1) to Eq. (4) with the cluster-based
    WSN model in Fig. 3, energy consumed at the cluster head is much larger than that
    at individual sensing node. The reason is as follows: The cluster-head needs to
    relay all the traffic of the cluster For each data unit, the cluster-head needs
    to transmit to a longer distance due to transmission between clusters, while the
    sensing nodes just transmit data inside the cluster. Figure 3. Clusterred WSN
    using Rapid Spanning Tree Show All C Clustering and Rapid Spanning Tree In this
    analysis, authors consider the wireless networks where all nodes in the network
    are homogenous and energy constrained, and each node can vary its transmission
    range to directly communicate with any node in the network. In this environment,
    instead of using a flat configuration, adopting the clustering approach [4] can
    statistically multiplex many connections into few paths so that the overall interferences
    can be reduced with well-controlled access. 1) Clustering Cluster Head The process
    of constructing cluster-head is comprised of two phases, as illustrated below:
    Initial phase First, partitions the multi-hop network and then chooses cluster-heads
    with the following stages Partitioning stage: Nodes in WSN partitions into clusters
    according to distributed clustering algorithm. Choosing stage: Every node within
    a cluster sends its remaining energy, to the cluster-head to which it belongs.
    The cluster-head, upon receiving the power information, chooses the node with
    the maximum power as the new cluster-head and broadcasts the decision to its members.
    Re-clustering phase When the energy of a cluster-head is lower than threshold,
    a cluster-head sends a message to the nodes in its cluster to attach to another
    cluster head. Since the power information is maintained by the cluster-head, this
    can be done with a broadcasting message. 2) Constructing Rapid spanning tree Rapid
    Spanning Tree topology can be thought of as a tree: it includes a root (sink node
    where data needs to be aggregaded), Routers/branches (Designated Switches) and
    leaves (End Nodes). On a tree there are no disconnected parts that are considered
    part of the tree; that is, the tree encompasses all of its leaves. In addition,
    there are no loops in a tree. If you trace a path from one leaf to any other leaf,
    you will find there is only one possible path. This is true for the Rapid Spanning
    Tree topology [3] as well. It organizes and connects switches into a loop-free
    topology while leaving no segments isolated. Following are key transition steps
    of the hybrid routing protocol. It monitors operational states and retires ports
    that are no longer functional. It processes inferior (Bridge Protocol Data Unit)
    BPDUs to detect topology changes. It keeps track of cluster heads that provide
    alternative paths to the Sink node. If a Root channel fails, RSTP can quickly
    retire the channel and make an Alternative channel as its new Root Channel. This
    new Root Channel can be placed in the forwarding state without delay. SECTION
    V Simulation Results The simulation is carried out using 10 to 200 nodes, randomly
    deployed over a 100m × 100m square area. The protocol stack is adjusted to IEEE
    802.11 standards. Authors have implemented cluster-based hybrid routing protocol
    and the simulation results for the hybrid protocol based on Rapid Spanning Tree
    and Cluster Head Routing are discussed below. Figure 4, shows the comparison of
    the network convergence time between Spanning Tree - Cluster Head Routing (CHR-STP)
    and Rapid Spanning Tree - Cluster Head Routing (CHR-RSTP). Figure 4. Network Convergence
    Time Show All The network convergence time of CHR-RSTP was in terms of milliseconds
    (ms) where as the convergence time of same number of nodes was in terms of seconds.
    The least spanning tree algorithm passively waited for the network to converge
    before it turned a port into the forwarding state. The achievement of faster convergence
    was a due to rapid transition of port/channel states based on the proposal-agreement
    algorithm in the Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol. When the energy level of the cluster
    head goes below the threshold level, the reattachment of cluster head begin and
    hence there is a change in topology of the spanned tree resulting in reconstruction
    of the spanning tree. Even during this time, convergence time of CHR-RSTP was
    very less when compared to CHR-STP and hence all the nodes in the network are
    converged in shorter duration, thereby minimizing initial data collection delay
    in the network and data loss due to change in topology of the network. Figure
    5. Throughput during topology configuration Show All Figure 5, shows the comparison
    of the throughput during topology configuration between Spanning Tree - Cluster
    Head Routing (CHR-STP) and Rapid Spanning Tree - Cluster Head Routing (CHR-RSTP).
    From the figure 5, it''s evident that number of packets transmitted for the configuration
    of the network during topology change was minimal in CHR-RSTP when compared to
    CHR-STP. In addition to less number of packets CHR-RSTP takes around 0.3 second
    for network configuration which is addendum for results obtained in Figure 4.
    More over the total number of packets transmitted in a period of 1.5 second during
    network configuration was found to be 125 packets for CHR-RSTP where as for CHR-STP
    was found to be 287 packets. In addition to network convergence time, CHR-RSTP
    also reduces number of packets required for network convergence thereby reducing
    the energy consumption for network re configuration and improving the network
    life time. SECTION VI Conclusions In this paper, authors proposed a novel energy-efficient
    hybrid routing protocol based on rapid spanning tree and cluster head routing
    for wireless sensor network in Agricultural environment to prolong network lifetime,
    minimize convergence time in case of topology change and also to shorten the path
    while emphasizing on energy conservation. RSTP is well equipped to deal with link
    failures and to provide rapid startup in Agricultural networks. Simulation results
    show that the convergence time has further improved by using hybrid protocol based
    on rapid spanning tree and clustering head routing. In addition to network convergence
    time, CHR-RSTP also reduces number of packets required for network convergence
    thereby reducing the energy consumption for network re configuration and thus
    improving the network life time. Hence this hybrid protocol is suitable for Agricultural
    applications to prolong the network life time. Authors Figures References Citations

    \ at risk due to continual climate change [1–3]. The\nrecorded increase in average\
    \ temperature across the world in the past hundred years, and\nthe associated\
    \ changes attributed to this, are known as global warming. Many scientists\nare\
    \ convinced by the published evidence that this change is anthropogenic and resulted\n\
    from the elevated emission levels of global greenhouse gases (GHGs) [4,5]. Gases\
    \ such as\nwater vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are\
    \ responsible for the\nabsorption and emission of thermal radiation. These changes\
    \ in the relative quantities of\nthe GHGs induce a proportional change in the\
    \ amount of preserved solar energy. Presently,\nthe accepted indicator for global\
    \ warming is the sustained rise in the mean temperature\nworldwide. This deﬁnition\
    \ is designed to account for the fact that there may be some\nlocalized exceptions\
    \ to this rise. For example, there may be cooling experienced in a\nregion while\
    \ the global temperature may increase altogether, hence the need for average\n\
    temperature. A key concern with the GHGs trapping of more heat in the atmosphere\
    \ is that\nit affects both climate and short scale weather patterns. Consequently,\
    \ it results in greater\nnumbers of adverse weather events such as storms, heat\
    \ waves, cold snaps, droughts, and\nﬁres [6]. Climate-related risks to health,\
    \ livelihoods, food security, water supply, human\nsafety, and economic growth\
    \ are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5 ◦C [7]\nand further increase\
    \ further at 2 ◦C, as shown in Figure 1. In addition, the risks to global\naggregated\
    \ economic growth due to the climate change impacts are projected to be lower\n\
    at 1.5 ◦C than at 2 ◦C by the end of this century.\nCarbon dioxide has the most\
    \ substantial effect on global warming [8]. Although it was\nonce assumed to have\
    \ an ~100 year lifespan in the atmosphere, careful studies revealed that\nthe\
    \ situation is far worse, with three-quarters of the gas expected to remain for\

    \ Risk Factors\nClimate change has several implications for the environment and\
    \ public health. It\nhas been inferred that the rise in the sea level will adversely\
    \ affect millions of lives [18].\nHigher concentrations of carbon dioxide are\
    \ due to the excessive use of fertilizers for\nincreasing crop yields. In fact,\
    \ increases in the number of chemicals used have considerable\neconomic and environmental\
    \ consequences, especially the water table beyond their natural\nstate [19]. Problems\
    \ related to pest and disease control in the agricultural settings can affect\n\
    the moisture–temperature balance [20]. Generally, it is recognized that both temperature\n\
    and an appropriate level of moisture can overcome such a problem. A rise in the\
    \ global\naverage temperature implies that equatorially conﬁned problems are expected\
    \ to be seen\nmore regularly further to the north and south. In short, climate\
    \ change is associated with\nthe (i) variability of rainfall patterns; (ii) changes\
    \ in water levels in the lakes, rivers, seas,\nponds, streams, and groundwater;\
    \ (iii) frequency of storms and droughts; (iv) increased\ndesert encroachment;\
    \ (v) excessive heat. In fact, all of these have serious implications on\nthe\
    \ environment and public health.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n4 of 26\nIn the\
    \ United States, a government report shows that the climate is constantly chang-\n\
    ing, wherein further human activities will lead to many more changes. These changes\
    \ will\naffect the sea levels, drought frequency, severe precipitation, and so\
    \ forth. The Climate\nScience Special Report was created by a United States government\
    \ organization for co-\nordinating and integrating the federal research data on\
    \ the global environment changes\nand their implications for the society. It also\
    \ laid out the current state of science relating\nto climate change and its physical\
    \ effects [21]. This report has assimilated numerous data\non the rise of surface\
    \ water level; atmospheric and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers;\ndiminishing\
    \ snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea levels; ocean acidiﬁcation; increasing\n\
    intensity and frequency of rainfall, hurricanes, heat waves, wildﬁres, and drought.\
    \ It\nmeticulously outlined how these effects can largely be traced back to human\
    \ activities and\nassociated emissions of potential GHGs as well as particles.\
    \ Underlying the report is a\nbroad scientiﬁc consensus which indicated that the\
    \ farther and faster the Earth system\nis pushed toward more changes, the greater\
    \ the risk is of unanticipated effects wherein\nsome of them are potentially large\
    \ and irreversible. It is expected that drought may plague\nthe western United\
    \ States for decades to come as well as Atlantic and Paciﬁc hurricanes\nthat could\
    \ be even more violent [22]. Brieﬂy, the report showed that our current emission\n\
    trajectories may bring our planet into a very different climate state than it\
    \ is today, with\nprofound effects on the United States.\nIn many regions of the\
    \ European countries, extreme weather and climate-related haz-\nards such as heat\
    \ waves, ﬂoods, and droughts will become more frequent and intense. This\nwill\
    \ have adverse impacts on ecosystems, economic sectors, and human health. Therefore,\n\
    the risks minimization due to global climate change requires various targeted\
    \ actions for\nadapting to such climate change-related impacts in addition to\
    \ the remedial measure to\nreduce the GHG emissions. Adaptation must be tailored\
    \ to the speciﬁc circumstances in\ndifferent regions and cities of Europe. Climate\
    \ change affects the agricultural systems in\ncomplex ways. In fact, the increase\
    \ in the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, temperatures,\nand changes in the precipitation\
    \ patterns including the drought conditions can signiﬁcantly\naffect the quantity,\
    \ quality, and stability of food production. Although the food security in\nEurope\
    \ is not expected to be at risk, the cascading impacts of climate change from\
    \ outside\nEurope may further affect the agricultural income and price levels\
    \ in Europe due to the\nalterations of trade patterns [23].\nClimate change has\
    \ already affected the conditions in Singapore with a mean tempera-\nture rise\
    \ from 26.6 ◦C to 27.7 ◦C during 1972–2014 [24]. Sea levels have also shown annual\n\
    increases of 1.2–1.7 mm in an equal timeframe (1975–2009). Increased annual rainfall\
    \ has\nlately became a grave concern, wherein a rise from 2192 mm to 2727 mm across\
    \ the span\n1980–2014 has been observed. The north of Singapore in 2001 witnessed\
    \ the impact of the\nﬁrst ever equatorial typhoon, Vamei, causing widespread localized\
    \ ﬂooding. The opinions\nabout this typhoon are divided on the likelihood of repetition.\
    \ The low altitude nature of\nthe city state ensures that rising sea levels present\
    \ the greatest threat to its future, with\n30% of the city lying less than 5 m\
    \ from the waterline and much of the rest within 15 m.\nMore frequent changes\
    \ in the local weather patterns can also hamper efforts of supplying\npotable\
    \ water, as both droughts and excess rainfall are liable to either empty or overwhelm\n\
    the current systems. It is also recognized that an average temperature rise in\
    \ the range of\n1.5–2.5 ◦C may be likely to have a signiﬁcant negative impact\
    \ on the biodiversity of both\nﬂora and fauna, endangering multiple species and\
    \ potentially damaging the ecosystem’s\nability to counter the effects of climate\
    \ change. The location of Singapore is ﬁrmly within\nthe region where vector-borne\
    \ diseases are locally prevalent during the warm season,\nwhich may happen concurrently\
    \ with heat related afﬂictions in the elderly and inﬁrm. In\naddition, it is found\
    \ that urbanization increased the local temperatures due to its ability\nto produce\
    \ and store heat in buildings and infrastructures. Consequently, a demand for\
    \ a\nhigher prevalence of cooling technologies such as air-conditioning units\
    \ and associated\nenergy burdens is likely, thereby increasing the release of\
    \ GHGs. At a wider scale, since\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n5 of 26\nSingapore\
    \ is reliant on global imports for the vast majority (>90%) of its food provision,\n\
    distant climate change effects on the food production may still have a knock-on\
    \ effect.\n3. Beneﬁts of 5G Technology Applications against Climate Change-Related\n\

    \ living. In fact, the availability of different services,\neconomic status, types\
    \ of lands, and local population all have signiﬁcant effects on energy\nrequirements.\
    \ The majority of fossil fuel-derived energy is the main contributor to climate\n\
    change. For example, over 84% of the recorded GHGs released in the United States\
    \ come\nfrom this outlet [30]. The global temperature rise is likely to increase\
    \ our energy demand\nand change our ability to produce electricity and deliver\
    \ it reliably. Worldwide, economic\ngrowth and development require energy. The\
    \ increased concentrations of key GHGs are\nthe direct consequences of human activities.\
    \ Since anthropogenic GHGs accumulate in the\natmosphere, they produce net warming\
    \ by strengthening the natural greenhouse effect.\nSpeciﬁcally, energy production\
    \ and consumption have various environmental implications,\none of which is climate\
    \ change [31]. Amongst various human activities that produce GHGs,\nthe use of\
    \ energy represents by far the largest source of the emissions. In essence, GHG\n\
    emissions related to energy can be cut in two ways [32]. First, by opting for\
    \ the cleaner\nenergy sources wherein the fossil fuels need to be replaced by\
    \ non-combustible renewable\nsources. Second, they can be lowered by reducing\
    \ the overall consumption of energy via\nits saving and efﬁciency gain through\
    \ smart energy managements.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n7 of 26\nAn ever-increasing\
    \ number of property developers are investing in Net-Zero Energy\n(NZE) buildings\
    \ as a means of reducing their utility costs with the additional beneﬁt that\n\
    they help to tackle the climate change [33,34]. Although complete take-up has\
    \ not yet been\nachieved, both lowering energy requirements and meeting them through\
    \ sustainable ways\noffer attractive evidence of cheaper and more responsible\
    \ business practices. In effect, while\nNZE constructions work towards the common\
    \ goal of renewable energy provision, there\nare personal beneﬁts to the owners\
    \ in the form of reduced expenditure. The combination of\n5G network, design,\
    \ building techniques, and technologies that go into a zero-energy home\n(all\
    \ result in a home) can produce net zero carbon emissions. This implies that such\
    \ smart\nhomes and buildings are not going to contribute to climate change. Some\
    \ recent reports\nrevealed that the construction sector is less innovative than\
    \ other sectors. Historically,\nbuilding contracts were awarded to those who charged\
    \ the least, with little regard given\nto other factors such as material sources.\
    \ Modern experiences have changed their intent,\nseeking to ensure that their\
    \ procurement used the most appropriate and cost-effective\noptions for construction.\
    \ This strategy became doubly effective as it has also beneﬁtted\nsocietal health\
    \ and local ecosystems [35,36]. The construction sector is one of the key sectors\n\
    responsible for global warming through excessive carbon dioxide release [37],\
    \ which alone\nuses 10% of the global energy and causes 40% of the global refuse\
    \ [38]. Current fears about\neco-stability and energy security mean that buildings\
    \ seeking to ensure these properties\nare being readily promoted [39].\nA structure\
    \ that is built without adding to GHG discharges or using more energy than\nit\
    \ can produce over its lifetime is described as NZE [40]. They provide power without\n\
    any dependence on centralized distribution [41]. This method of design can be\
    \ applied\nworldwide, even in places subject to adverse weather. Typically, they\
    \ need higher energy for\nsafe use and become increasingly attractive because\
    \ the sustainable nature of the generation\nmethods ensures that GHGs are not\
    \ released into the environment [42]. The development\nof such structures became\
    \ possible due to the help of academia that conducted detailed\nassessments of\
    \ the data describing the energy demands and industrial growth in the form\nof\
    \ innovative technologies. These structures are not yet the norm for the developed\
    \ nations\ndespite their increasing prevalence. Contemporary software can determine\
    \ the efﬁcacy\nof different prototype solutions to a given problem, and thus NZE\
    \ protocols offer an\nopportunity to lower both GHG emissions and dependency on\
    \ the archaic forms of energy\nsupply. It became clear that there are no exceptions\
    \ to the idea that any process will release\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere,\
    \ not even for construction. The main way of GHG\nreduction is through the minimization\
    \ of fossil fuel combustion. However, by simply\nminimizing its usage one may\
    \ not be able to remove the daily demand of energy across\nthe global economy.\
    \ This should make it readily apparent that NZE constructions provide\nan ideal\
    \ solution to this constrained demand by allowing the users to generate their\
    \ own\npower at the point of use. It is important to note that a true NZE building\
    \ can offset the\ncarbon dioxide emissions produced throughout its construction\
    \ by generating renewable\npower on site [43].\nHigh performance structures such\
    \ as NZE buildings are the ideal response if the\nconstruction industry desires\
    \ to tackle climate change, since they provide similar beneﬁts\nto both constructor\
    \ and user in terms of energy generation and use, as well as associated\nhealth\
    \ and wellbeing. Consequently, the increase in NZE tactics can certainly increase\n\
    a nation’s economy [44]. Global recognition that the earth is a ﬁnite resource\
    \ is a key\nfactor in the transition to NZE construction as a means of ensuring\
    \ sustainability. The\nNZE certiﬁcation for the buildings is awarded by the highly\

    \ technologies to be test-bedded and\ndeveloped. In the School of Design and Environment\

    \ building is an excellent research area devoted\nto developing and testing the\
    \ practical Virtual Reality (VR) and Artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) solutions designed\
    \ to improve person–environment wellness through a sustainable\necosystem. StarHub’s\

    \ via a 3.5 GHz trial spectrum. The 5G technology provides ultra-reliable\nlow-latency\
    \ communications and enhanced bandwidth performance. These are the two\nkey features\
    \ necessary for the VR and AI solutions to run seamlessly. With the emergence\n\
    of IoT, it became cost-effective to implement a digital twin of a building’s operation\
    \ that\ncontinuously learns and updates itself using the information from the\
    \ building energy\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n9 of 26\nmanagement systems.\
    \ The role of 5G network in this case is to address the need to support\nmultiple\
    \ IoT devices in a small area. It helps for the data analysis over the cloud to\
    \ achieve\nthe real-time information from various IoT devices. In addition, the\
    \ low latency of 5G\nnetwork ensures a more real-time analysis of the data [29].\n\
    A pathway to achieve the net-positive energy is based on the School of Design\
    \ and\nEnvironment building annual post-occupancy studies and energy audits from\
    \ April 2019\nto March 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 circuit breaker period in Singapore,\
    \ the School of\nDesign and Environment building has performed beyond its net-zero\
    \ design intent. Beyond\nthe design intent, this building expected a net-positive\
    \ energy outcome. This resulted from\na concerted and collaborative effort by\
    \ the School’s management and building users that\nensured a prudent consumption\
    \ of energy all-year-round. A Building Management System\nthat includes the Occupancy\
    \ Sensing Thermal Controls and Indoor Environmental Quality\nMonitoring overseen\
    \ by the school ensures that these trends in building occupancy and\nenergy usage\
    \ are monitored and studied for a continued and sustained impact throughout\n\
    the building lifespan. The School of Design and Environment net-positive energy\
    \ building\nachieved several beneﬁts, including the promotion of the health and\
    \ wellbeing of occupants,\nsaving energy and maintenance costs, and a reduction\
    \ in GHG emission and climate change,\nthus creating a more resilient future.\n\
    3.2. Smart Wastes Management\nWaste management has numerous impacts on climate\
    \ change and the environment,\nsuch as landﬁlls, waste recycling, incineration,\
    \ and composting [45]. Climate change is\nexpected to produce more frequent and\
    \ powerful natural disasters that will increase the\namount of disaster-related\
    \ waste generation. Communities can adapt to these disasters and\nincrease their\
    \ resiliency by preparing beforehand through pre-incident planning. Planning\n\
    can expedite the removal of waste during and after an incident, which can reduce\
    \ dangers\nof ﬁre and personal injury, as well as disease vectors, by identifying\
    \ waste management\nopportunities and strategies. Greater levels of GHGs exist\
    \ in the environment due to\nhuman interference which is causing the global surface\
    \ temperature to rise and initiating\nclimatic changes. Gases such as CO2, methane,\
    \ and nitrous oxide are the main constituents\nof the GHG cohort [46] that are\
    \ produced during waste management and disposal. Table 1\nshows the estimated\
    \ total emissions of these gases from Europe and the contributions from\nsolid\
    \ waste disposal [47]. It is worth noting that the uncertainty concerning these\
    \ emission\nestimates are signiﬁcant. The impact of solid waste management on\
    \ global warming is\nequivalent to the European GHG emissions that mostly emerge\
    \ from CH4 being released\nas biodegradable wastes decay under the airless (anaerobic)\
    \ conditions in landﬁlls. About\none third of the anthropogenic emissions of CH4\
    \ in Europe is due to this source [48]. In\ncontrast, only 1% of N2O emission\
    \ [49] and less than 0.5% of CO2 emission are associated\nwith solid waste disposal.\n\

    \ in a balance and the most difﬁcult challenge faced by mankind is not\ndue to\
    \ the exploitation of nature, but is to maintain this critical balance while doing\
    \ so.\nMassive exploitation of the earth’s crust has provided man with endless\
    \ natural resources\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n10 of 26\nthat are constantly\
    \ being transformed into products and discarded as waste after serving\ntheir\
    \ purpose [50]. Unfortunately, man cannot return these waste products to their\
    \ crude\nstate in the earth’s crust. Hence, the easiest route of escape is to\
    \ release these materials\nto the atmosphere in gaseous forms. The accumulation\
    \ of these gases in the atmosphere\nover many years has upset a critical balance\
    \ of nature. The issue of global warming and\nclimate change will continue to\
    \ be a threat until humans learn to return used or waste\nproducts in their crude\
    \ forms to nature. Obviously, this is impossible and the closest that\nhumans\
    \ can ever achieved to this is the recycling and reusing of waste. The most popular\n\
    contributor to global warming via gaseous emission into the atmosphere is the\
    \ burning of\nfossil fuel. Recently, dedicated efforts are being made, especially\
    \ in developed nations, to\nreduce dependence on fossil fuels as a means to reduce\
    \ global warming. However, a silent\nbut massive contributor to GHG emissions\
    \ is waste management. A recent report by the\nUnited States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency estimates that about 42% of the total GHG\nemissions in the nation are\
    \ associated with waste materials management and disposal [51].\nA simple analysis\
    \ reveals that the activities associated with waste disposal and management\n\
    can contribute a total of 57% of CH4 emission compared to 26% contributed by energy\n\
    production.\nWaste management options such as landﬁll, composting, incineration/mass\
    \ burns,\nand anaerobic digestion/biogas plants collectively emit a substantial\
    \ amount of GHGs.\nComposting makes use of micro-organisms to oxidize the biodegradable\
    \ wastes (especially\nfood and garden waste) to CO2 and water vapor using oxygen\
    \ in the air as the oxidizing\nagent. Anaerobic decomposition converts biodegradable\
    \ carbon to biogas that consists of\nabout 65% of CH4 and 34% of CO2 with traces\
    \ of other gases [52]. In landﬁlls, the microbes\ngradually decompose the organic\
    \ matter over time, producing roughly 50% of CH4 and\n50% of CO2 as well as trace\
    \ amounts of other gaseous compounds [52]. Methane emission\nfrom landﬁlls represents\
    \ the largest source of GHG in the waste sector, contributing around\n700 million\
    \ tons (Mt) of CO2-e in 2009, followed by incineration, estimated to contribute\n\
    around 40 Mt of CO2-e [53].\nLately, smart cities are providing dynamic control\
    \ of their waste streams [54]. Com-\npanies are now better equipped with appropriate\
    \ software that enables monitoring the\nexcretions. This has dual beneﬁts such\
    \ as the reduction of costs and the perceived load on\nthe local ecosystems. Both\
    \ individuals and businesses refuse management has received\nmultiple high-tech\
    \ updates such as self-sorting and collection tools. OnePlus systems are\nthe\
    \ recognized toolbox for smart waste monitoring. An example of this is the OnePlus\n\
    Metro, which is a sensor capable of providing real-time analysis of the free capacity\
    \ cur-\nrently available within on-site storage bins. Combining this with the\
    \ WasteForce platform\nprovides facile opportunities to monitor this capacity\
    \ remotely. In addition, it performs\nin-depth data assessment and evaluation\
    \ as a means of dynamic business management.\nThe end result is that the business\
    \ is less likely to face ﬁnancial penalties through the failure\nof waste disposal\
    \ in a timely manner. At a wider scale, the data can be collated by refuse\ncollectors\
    \ as a means of ensuring the efﬁciency of their service can be maximized or through\n\
    installation of remote image sensors in their refuse storage bins that allow for\
    \ personally\nmonitoring the charges in real time. As an additional beneﬁt, the\
    \ inclusion of location\ntracker sensors using Global Positioning System (GPS)\
    \ technology offers the chance to\nstreamline the delivery and collection process\
    \ on the ﬂy. Further data are provided by\nin-line tilt monitors that offer a\
    \ proxy for marking off when a bin has been emptied. These\nfeatures of the smart\
    \ system work together to ensure that drivers on the ground can better\nmanage\
    \ their agenda, minimize the time of travel and distances, and adjust the schedules\n\
    in response to sudden changes immediately after receiving the automated text instruction.\n\
    It is clear that the implementation of such systems can go beyond immediate reduction\
    \ of\nwaste generation and increased recycling, indicating the existence of knock-on\
    \ effects such\nas tackling climate change.\nThe term IoT is used to describe\
    \ a network of embedded devices that are interlinked\nvia the internet and can\
    \ be remotely managed. Connecting trash cans to the internet\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 9720\n11 of 26\nvia smart waste management software provides the operators\
    \ with live data on their\nservice demands. Contemporary increases in population\
    \ growth have resulted in a related\nincrease in refuse disposal. Without appropriate\
    \ action being taken, there is an increased\nlikelihood that disease transmission\
    \ between populations will occur more readily. Smart\nrefuse storage can be remotely\
    \ tracked and the data can be used to guide the outcomes.\nThese storage bins\
    \ are typically dispersed throughout a given jurisdiction across multiple\nscales\
    \ (business, school, neighborhood, and city). They contain built-in computational\n\
    control managed by the infrared and radiofrequency parts. The infrared signal\
    \ is used\nto measure the height of wastes currently in the storage bin. Then,\
    \ the result is encoded\nand transmitted using radio broadcasting to a central\
    \ hub where data from all sites can\nbe collated. The hub can then provide summaries\
    \ via the internet to the system operator,\nenabling them to perform a variety\
    \ of processes via a graphical user interface within a\nsimple web browser [55,56].\n\
    In Singapore, both hazardous and safe solid wastes are managed via the plans derived\n\
    by the National Environment Agency (NEA). This agency has legislative control\
    \ over\nthe regulations governing waste treatment and disposal. These regulations\
    \ include the\nEnvironmental Public Health Act, Environmental Public Health (General\
    \ Waste Collection)\nRegulations, Environmental Public Health (General Waste Disposal\
    \ Facilities) Regulations),\nand Environmental Public Health (Toxic Industrial\
    \ Waste) Regulations. In the 1970s,\nSingapore used to excrete approximately 1260\
    \ t of waste daily. The combined economic and\npopulation growth it has experienced\
    \ since that era led to an increase in the waste levels\nseven times higher at\
    \ present [57], a ﬁgure which is expected to continue to rise as long as\nthese\
    \ growths continue. This has, in turn, come into conﬂict with the nation as a\
    \ whole,\nsince waster must have sufﬁcient room for storage, and the state is\
    \ severely restricted in\nthe availability of land stock suitable for this purpose.\
    \ The Singaporean response to this\nproblem is clearly depicted in Figure 6, illustrating\
    \ different approaches that can be taken\ntowards continual refuse oversight.\
    \ All of these approaches are reliant on the interplay\nof different parties from\
    \ both the public and private realms. The NEA partnership has\nproduced multiple\
    \ guidance schemes aimed at tackling increases in waste production. For\nexample,\
    \ the separation of recycling is now undertaken pre-collection, at the source\
    \ of\nwaste production, as a way to reduce system strain. Non-recyclable waste\
    \ is later collated\nand disposed of in waste-to-energy incineration devices,\
    \ which are capable of reducing the\nvolume of waste requiring further treatment\
    \ to just that of the non-combustible element,\nwhich is approximately 10% of\
    \ the starting product. The combustible portion generates\nsufﬁcient heat to turn\
    \ a steam turbine and contribute 3% of the nation’s power demand.\nThe ash and\
    \ other non-ﬂammable wastes are ultimately exported via Tuas Marine Transfer\n\
    Station (TMTS) on boats bound for the Semakau landﬁll.\nSustainability 2021, 13,\

    \ The collocation employed—it is sited \nadjacent to Tuas Water Reclamation Plant\
    \ (WRP)—allowed the facilities to jointly in-\ncrease their efficiency and reduce\
    \ GHG emissions. It is clear that there are serious prob-\nlems to overcome when\
    \ 5.5 million inhabitants choose to live in such close confines, not \nthe least\
    \ of which is the provision of potable drinking water and sanitary extraction\
    \ of \nwaste. In the case of Singapore, this is clearly well tackled by combining\
    \ solid and liquid \nwaste treatment to increase efficiency across multiple levels.\
    \ The design of the \nIWMF-WRP collaboration has been enacted by the National\
    \ Water and Environment \nAgencies appointment of an international consultancy\
    \ to provide facility oversight. This \nscheme can handle both energy generation\
    \ from burning solid refuse, and sludge, along \nwith the processing of recyclable\
    \ wastes in the Material Recovery Facility (MRF). \nThe building of both sites\
    \ is a stepping stone in Phase 2 of the extensive Deep Tunnel \nSewerage System\
    \ (DTSS) scheme. It can be considered as a superior method for collation \nand\
    \ processing of waste water streams, whereas the IWMF performs a similar task\
    \ for \nsolid waste disposal. This project will be the first to intentionally\
    \ design a site around \ntwinned waste management streams. There are clear benefits\
    \ to improving the water \nsustainability in operating a parallel solid refuse\
    \ system around the collection, treatment, \nand emission of waste water, such\
    \ as the opportunity to recycle fluids. At a solid refuse \ncapacity of 2.5 Mt,\
    \ incinerating waste in the IWMF’s facility offers five times the output of \n\
    major European competitors, and the dual stream fluid bed combustors used are\
    \ simi-\nlarly world leading. Anaerobic digestion is used to undertake the initial\
    \ breakdown of \nbiological matter such as food and other organics without the\
    \ need for supplementary \noxygen, which in turn allows Tuas WRP to create biogas.\

    \ adopted in Singapore.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n12 of 26\nCurrently, the\
    \ greatest energy recovery scheme operating worldwide is in Singapore—\nthe Integrated\
    \ Waste Management Facility (IWMF) that includes many novel design fea-\ntures\
    \ which are all cutting edge technology. The collocation employed—it is sited\
    \ adjacent\nto Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (WRP)—allowed the facilities to jointly\
    \ increase their efﬁ-\nciency and reduce GHG emissions. It is clear that there\
    \ are serious problems to overcome\nwhen 5.5 million inhabitants choose to live\
    \ in such close conﬁnes, not the least of which\nis the provision of potable drinking\
    \ water and sanitary extraction of waste. In the case\nof Singapore, this is clearly\
    \ well tackled by combining solid and liquid waste treatment\nto increase efﬁciency\
    \ across multiple levels. The design of the IWMF-WRP collaboration\nhas been enacted\
    \ by the National Water and Environment Agencies appointment of an\ninternational\
    \ consultancy to provide facility oversight. This scheme can handle both energy\n\
    generation from burning solid refuse, and sludge, along with the processing of\
    \ recyclable\nwastes in the Material Recovery Facility (MRF).\nThe building of\
    \ both sites is a stepping stone in Phase 2 of the extensive Deep Tunnel\nSewerage\
    \ System (DTSS) scheme. It can be considered as a superior method for collation\n\
    and processing of waste water streams, whereas the IWMF performs a similar task\
    \ for solid\nwaste disposal. This project will be the ﬁrst to intentionally design\
    \ a site around twinned\nwaste management streams. There are clear beneﬁts to\
    \ improving the water sustainability\nin operating a parallel solid refuse system\
    \ around the collection, treatment, and emission of\nwaste water, such as the\
    \ opportunity to recycle ﬂuids. At a solid refuse capacity of 2.5 Mt,\nincinerating\
    \ waste in the IWMF’s facility offers ﬁve times the output of major European\n\
    competitors, and the dual stream ﬂuid bed combustors used are similarly world\
    \ leading.\nAnaerobic digestion is used to undertake the initial breakdown of\
    \ biological matter such as\nfood and other organics without the need for supplementary\
    \ oxygen, which in turn allows\nTuas WRP to create biogas.\nAs a way of updating\
    \ the 1992 Singapore Green Plan (SGP), in 2002 the Ministry of\nthe Environment\
    \ and Water Resources published the Singapore Green Plan 2012. In this\ndocument,\
    \ there are eight fundamental aims, whereby the state intends to ensure that\n\
    Singapore is eco-friendly, and that it uses sufﬁcient green interventions to preserve\
    \ resource\nintegrity and both local and global environs. A further measure is\
    \ included which aims\nto ensure new changes in the land, considering the future,\
    \ by instilling environmental\nawareness in the national psyche. The SGP 2012\
    \ is re-assessed on a thrice-yearly basis by\nseeking the views of focus groups\
    \ discussing elements such as Air and Climate Change,\nWater and Clean Land, and\
    \ Nature and Public Health.\nIoT, supported by 5G technology, allows the objects\
    \ to be sensed or controlled remotely\nacross existing network infrastructure\
    \ [58,59]. This remote sensing and controlling leads\nto more direct integration\
    \ of the physical world into computer-based systems, resulting\nin improved efﬁciency,\
    \ accuracy, and economic beneﬁts thanks to reduced human inter-\nvention [60].\
    \ On a wide scale, when IoT is augmented with the sensors and actuators, the\n\
    technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems.\
    \ It also\nencompasses the technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent\
    \ transportation,\nand smart cities [61]. It is in the perspective of building\
    \ smart cities that IoT can be used for\nwaste management purposes. IoT works\
    \ through an IP address allocated to each object. In\nother words, each thing\
    \ is uniquely identiﬁable through its embedded computing system\nbut is able to\
    \ interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure [62].\nThe current\
    \ mechanisms for the collection of waste foodstuffs involve multiple un-\nconnected\
    \ enterprises working along a ﬁxed route in the small hours. Clearly, there are\n\
    opportunities whereby inefﬁciency may arise through the excess collection or careless\
    \ route\nplanning because they run along the same line and are unaware of the\
    \ volume of waste to\nbe picked up. The system presented herein recommends that\
    \ the ideal solution to this lack\nof efﬁciency in the processing of culinary\
    \ refuse is due to the implementation of a Smart\nGarbage System (SGS) which uses\
    \ Smart Garbage Bins (SGB) as a means of monitoring\nlive capacity. The system\
    \ envisioned allows pickup drivers to use a smartphone to retrieve\ngarbage levels\
    \ from each SGB in their jurisdiction, along with their respective locations\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n13 of 26\nthat have been ascertained by middleware\
    \ queries, and thus determine which of the SGBs\nneed to be emptied and the optimal\
    \ route between them that allows for adequate levels of\nservice provision without\
    \ reducing system efﬁciency.\nClassiﬁcation of refuse can be assisted by IoT in\
    \ which manual separation of trash\nis incredibly labor intensive. New models\
    \ of digital bins can undertake this sorting on\ntheir own. A pertinent case study\
    \ is perhaps Bin-e, from Poland, a product which features\nmultiple efﬁciency\
    \ improving measures, such as AI-trained object recognition, capacity\nmonitoring,\
    \ and internal data analysis. These trash cans are considered smart, and can\n\
    distinguish four waste classes—metals, plastics, paper, and glass. A further feature\
    \ of these\nbins is their ability to undergo waste compression in conjunction\
    \ with ﬁll level monitoring\nwhich is transmitted to remote operators. Each device\
    \ embedded in this system provides\nreal time ﬁll speeds daily, while the control\
    \ system undertakes longer term monitoring by\nconsidering the collection rates\
    \ required. The key strength of IoT networks is their ability to\nfeed into wider\
    \ reaching aspects of smart city design. The power offered by the size of the\n\
    data set provided allows for greater-depth statistical analysis for the purpose\
    \ of maximizing\nefﬁcacy. There are inﬁnite ways to enact this change, including\
    \ SGB relocation, addressing\npublic misconceptions about non-categorized items,\
    \ or lowering the volume of trash which\nmust ultimately be buried. Using IoT\
    \ as the means of advanced city management for the\nhealth of both the citizens\
    \ and the planet is becoming increasingly commonplace.\nToday, the IoT devices\
    \ are mostly connected via cabled technologies including both\nshielded twisted-pair\
    \ LAN and coaxial cables. In some limited areas, Wi-Fi may have\nsome usage, however,\
    \ it is not always ideal. Further, 5G enables many more sensors to be\nput in\
    \ place without a need for cables and a conduit for each cable. In recent years,\
    \ the\ndevelopment of IoT processes has accelerated with many seemingly futuristic\
    \ concepts\nbeginning to be considered as the commonplace in our daily lives.\
    \ Bandwidth is the key\nbottleneck that must be addressed. Mobile communications\
    \ are affected by this, despite\nthe distance they may cover. Wi-Fi suffers from\
    \ the inverse problem, whereby volume\nis higher, but range is low, in addition\
    \ to the security concern. 5G has been touted as a\nsolution to these problems,\
    \ since it can massively enhance the mobile bandwidth, and thus\nIoT networks\
    \ become increasingly feasible. Although 5G is the incoming new standard,\nthe\
    \ current norm of 4G does at least offer upload and download speeds of 7 to 17\
    \ and 12 to\n36 Mbps, respectively. The rate of transmission offered by 5G (15–20\
    \ Gbps) is several orders\nof magnitude higher compared to the one offered by\
    \ 4G cellular network, while similarly\noffering latencies one tenth of 4G. These\
    \ advances combine to produce a network capable\nof connecting many more devices\
    \ together. Due to these reasons, the IoT is built on 5G\ntechnology, though the\
    \ suitability of this remains contentious in academic and professional\ncircles.\
    \ The key argument presented most often being that the current devices do not\
    \ require\nthese extreme transmission rates, or minimal latency for their intended\
    \ functionality, such\nas asset tracking or remote monitoring, to be achieved.\
    \ Notwithstanding this, Gartner\nestimates that two out of three businesses have\
    \ by now introduced 5G technology, and that\nalone should provide momentum to\
    \ 5G take-up.\nImplementation of IoT-linked sensor networks offers all interested\
    \ parties multiple\nbeneﬁts, such as lower pickup charges. SGBs provide continuous\
    \ ﬁll level monitoring data\nto the operators. In fact, IoT can be deployed to\
    \ analyze this data, ensuring that the Lorries\ntake the shortest paths in the\
    \ service provision. Consequently, only those SGBs which\nrequire immediate attention\
    \ are emptied, and thus both fuel expenses and person-hours\nare reduced. Collections\
    \ are guaranteed through the IoT-linked sensor networks operation.\nSmart processes\
    \ ensure that ﬁll capacity of SGB is never exceeded, since the relevant powers\n\
    are always aware of the remaining space in each of their collection sites, allowing\
    \ them to\nempty them in good time. That refuse production evaluation can be performed\
    \ by choosing\nthe ideal path is not the only reason to implement smart tech in\
    \ waste disposal, instead\nit is clear that most of the value lies in interpreting\
    \ the information gleaned. As such, it\nis rare to encounter an IoT product that\
    \ cannot offer analysis, which offers a convenient\nway to ﬁnd and predict future\
    \ trends in production. It lowers the carbon dioxide release.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 9720\n14 of 26\nExtensive debate has taken place over the scale and\
    \ impact of the carbon dioxide released\nfrom processing waste and recycling.\
    \ It is clear that greater path efﬁciency reduces fuel\nrequirements, and thus\
    \ the emissions which are the clear way to ensure more sustainable\nmethods are\
    \ used.\nOperators of refuse collection services in urban areas can enjoy considerable\
    \ advan-\ntages from the implementation of the IoT techniques. Examples of these\
    \ advantages include\nlower expenditure, more efﬁcient working, and happier consumers,\
    \ purely by ensuring\ntimely collection and disposal of their refuse. As the number\
    \ of Wi-Fi enabled technologies\navailable to purchase increases, their associated\
    \ costs continue to reduce and thus allow for\never more implementation of IoT\
    \ technology in tackling waste management. Thus, a more\ncost-effective method\
    \ is to invest now if the aim is to tackle climate change, as the interplay\n\
    of 5G and IoT will have a transformative effect in the near future, making urban\
    \ areas\ncapable of tackling environmental damage. Enterprises will be better\
    \ able to contribute to\nthis ﬁght by lowering their GHG releases through smart,\
    \ IoT managed systems.\n3.3. Water Resources Management\nThe effects of climate\
    \ change on drinking water supplies are often debated at both\nprofessional and\
    \ academic meetings. Rises in the global temperatures are known to adjust\nthe\
    \ precipitation ratio in the direction of rain, rather than snow. The principal\
    \ changes\nwould be that runoff would occur in different temporal and spatial\
    \ regions, with reduced\nsnowmelt in spring due to more water draining earlier\
    \ in the winter season. This change\nwould be particularly stark in areas of high\
    \ elevation, and those far from the equator. The\nend result is that the precipitation\
    \ may experience local variation in extent, rather than a\nuniform increase or\
    \ decrease. These patterns may be mirrored on larger scales, such as with\nthe\
    \ seasons, or in freak weather patterns. Knowledge of the local weather conditions\
    \ is\nused extensively in managing water supplies. The efﬁcacy of the decision\
    \ made using this\ninformation depends on the nature of collaborative analysis\
    \ undertaken by hydrologists\nand climatologists. Post-development, the management\
    \ of water processing and delivery\nsites is based on past, present, and future\
    \ climate data [63,64].\nClimate being a key design parameter in the systems development\
    \ and implemen-\ntation, any changes require adjustments to the tools applied\
    \ in many areas, in order to\nensure the maintenance of demand and supply relation.\
    \ In this way, both objectives and\nlimitations are adhered to within the remit\
    \ of managing state water resources. The extent\nto which these differences have\
    \ an effect is proportional to the level of climate change\nthrough the product\
    \ lifespan, and the robustness of the system in terms of its ability to\nmediate\
    \ the effects of external change—in other words, there is a limit to change, beyond\n\
    which the assumptions on which a system is built no longer apply, and thus the\
    \ system\nbecomes unﬁt for its purpose. Some recent studies demonstrated that\
    \ climate change has\na direct effect on the ability of populations to access\
    \ potable water reserves [65,66], with\nareas typically inundated with ample volumes\
    \ of freshwater now needing to consider how\nbest to manage their resources in\
    \ a way that allows for occasional shortfalls. For example,\nthe Puducherry area\
    \ has historically possessed abundant natural reservoirs of potable\nwater; however,\
    \ the increased need for access to this resource by a growing population\nand\
    \ economy, buoyed up by increased agricultural and industrial activity, has begun\
    \ to\naffect this availability, with both quantity and quality at risk. Key variations\
    \ in the local\ninfrastructure, such as land use, crop choices, seawater intrusion,\
    \ polluting behaviors, and\nwater pricing structures mean that the hydrological\
    \ cycle in the area is changing quickly.\nIn addition, there are reported differences\
    \ in mean temperature and humidity, and littoral\nattrition. Taking all these\
    \ factors together, it becomes evident that sustainable water supply\nmanagement\
    \ and implementation is a critical concern. To ensure this, it is recommended\n\
    that an objective assessment of the current and future requirements must be undertaken\n\
    with special concern given to the invariability of a system to changes in atmospheric\
    \ condi-\ntions. As a way to address this challenge, this presentation offers\
    \ an all-inclusive overview\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n15 of 26\nof how best\
    \ to manage water resources within the limitations imposed by acknowledging\n\
    and tackling climate change.\nContemporary strategies such as smart management\
    \ systems ensure that the control\nof the water supply chain is both optimized\
    \ and also transparent throughout its entire\nservice from the acquisition to\
    \ the storage, supply, collection, processing, and eventual\nre-use. The use of\
    \ digital systems offers better opportunities to collate and analyze the data\n\
    used to guide the dynamic control measures that aim to raise the efﬁcacy of the\
    \ service\nprovided. The end result is a system that is tougher and more immune\
    \ to volatility in all\naspects of operation, implying that expenditure is reduced\
    \ and the system becomes more\nof a long term solution. Several modern technologies\
    \ can be implemented in this regard,\nsuch as supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ (SCADA) or geographic information\nsystems (GIS), alongside the more conventional\
    \ sensory equipment. Accordingly, the water\nresource becomes a composite system\
    \ that can be described as instrumented, intercon-\nnected, and intelligent. In\
    \ effect, its functions can be monitored automatically, inform\nhigher level overseers\
    \ of current conditions, and yet undertake independent analysis of\nthe data collected\
    \ as a means of ensuring low level stability without needing to escalate all\n\
    concerns.\nAccording to the United Nations, in the year 2025, one ﬁfth of the\
    \ global inhabitants\nwill be directly affected by water shortages, with the remainder\
    \ of the population along\nwith the wider environment also suffering from less\
    \ direct effects. Implementation of\nthe smart systems is a key method through\
    \ which some of the problems caused by past\ncarelessness can be reversed, thus\
    \ protecting this shared resource. The AI technology,\nbig data methods, and the\
    \ IoT are expected to play vital roles in such a reversal [67,68].\nThe water\
    \ resource management sector can only achieve its aims using the IoT. A novel\n\
    concept which combines these elements is described as the Internet of Water. The\
    \ concept\nencompasses all relevant parties concerned with the collection, storage,\
    \ distribution, use,\nand disposal of water within a given society, allowing them\
    \ to ensure that decisions made\nare of equal beneﬁt to all. IoT is the most suitable\
    \ method to make this connection for\nthe water industry because it has six outstanding\
    \ elements. The ﬁrst element ensures that\nthe governing processes are readily\
    \ visible. The second one involves the live monitoring\nthat ensures problems\
    \ do not go undetected. The third component deals with the use\nof automation\
    \ that allows human resources to be better invested. The fourth element\npromotes\
    \ sustainability, reducing the waste streams. The ﬁfth one uses various algorithms\n\
    to analyze the data and allows different pro-active strategies to be implemented.\
    \ Finally,\nthe sixth element allows the water industry to mediate its climate\
    \ change contributions.\nThe water sector is increasingly more aware of the fact\
    \ that natural resources are\nlimited and we are using them at their maximum or\
    \ close to their maximum potential.\nIt is essential that we identify not just\
    \ current needs, but also future needs, in order to\nensure the sustainability\
    \ of water resources. With artiﬁcial intelligence, not only is it\npossible to\
    \ automate risk management, but also to simulate the behavior of water networks\n\
    under different scenarios and detect anomalies, thus improving efﬁciency. Because\
    \ of\nits large magnitude, the water sector needs information and knowledge exchange\
    \ that is\ntransparent, fast, ﬂexible, and secure, among all actors involved in\
    \ the integrated water\ncycle. The block-chain enables closing the water services’\
    \ purchase–sale transactions\ndigitally between the actors themselves, at the\
    \ same time as transparency and secure\nnon-personal data ﬂow are strengthened\
    \ [69]. The water sector is already immersed in\nan unprecedented technological\
    \ change. The new technologies are having an impact on\nthe way entities function,\
    \ transforming business as usual, and creating and changing the\nopinion trends\
    \ of end users. In fact, the entities dedicate more and more resources to\nprevent\
    \ any potential risks and use the opportunities that Industry 4.0 offers for integrated\n\
    water cycle management.\nThe development of the IoT has meant that enterprises\
    \ can now seek to install sensors\nthroughout their operations as a means of collecting\
    \ and passing data to both internal and\nexternal collators. It is predicted that\
    \ such a strategy can only increase efﬁciency across the\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 9720\n16 of 26\nbusiness as a whole. The use of 5G-IoT smart solutions to\
    \ business quandaries will enable\nthem to reduce their carbon footprint. This\
    \ 5G-based Smart Water-control and Monitoring\ntool ensures that real time, ﬁne\
    \ detail analysis, and dynamic control can be applied to\nrenovate the antiquated\
    \ approaches of water management. The global implementation of\n5G ensures that\
    \ this ﬁght can be picked up around the world, so that a planetary approach\n\
    can be taken to ensuring access to safe water sources in the future. It is anticipated\
    \ that\nthe reduced delays in reportage offered by 5G’s inherent construction\
    \ will mean that more\ntimely responses can be made in response to emergent issues.\
    \ Due to the interconnected\nnature of these new systems, the response will be\
    \ better informed, as all relevant parties\nwill have equal access to the data\
    \ storage. Of note is the scale of the increase in device\nhandling capability\
    \ from 4G to 5G. While the former is limited to ~60,000/km2, the latter\ncan accommodate\
    \ over a million unique devices. In brief, there are clear and tangible\nbeneﬁts\
    \ to using 5G rather than 4G in the water industry, as the latter will never be\
    \ capable\nof providing sufﬁcient bandwidth so as to be able to conduct remote\
    \ live monitoring in\nHD quality of both water and waste plants.\n3.4. Agriculture\
    \ Management\nThe amount of water that plants require for growth depends on overall\
    \ soil humidity.\nThis is typically measured by manually applying sensors on site;\
    \ however, this task could\nbe readily undertaken through smart sensors, which\
    \ would provide a more efﬁcient, timely,\nand accurate means of monitoring. The\
    \ IoT in an agriculture framework includes various\nbeneﬁts in managing and monitoring\
    \ crops [70]. Developing an intelligent system using\nIoT for agriculture could\
    \ be able to monitor the crops growth and its environment [71,72];\neven though\
    \ the collection of raw data is important [73], the mining and analysis of the\n\
    data is also considered to be an essential task. Agriculture ﬁeld products [74–76]\
    \ have\nseveral issues which can be solved with IoT, enabling one to predict,\
    \ monitor, and manage\nthe cycle of agriculture products. In several countries\
    \ agriculture is the largest livelihood\nprovider; with nearly half of the population\
    \ still relying on agriculture for income [77].\nZhao et al. [78] proposed the\
    \ integration of IoT technology to real-time production of\nagriculture crops\
    \ with remote monitoring and wireless communication using the internet.\nThis\
    \ constitutes a management system of information which is also designed to handle\n\
    the crop data for research purposes. Ning and Wang [79] differentiated IoT in\
    \ two aspects,\nnamely Unit IoT and Ubiquitous IoT, where man’s like neural model\
    \ (MLN) is considered\nin unit IoT and a global integration of unit IoT is considered\
    \ as ubiquitous IoT. Using\nthis combination, a social organization framework\
    \ model (SOF) was constructed for the\nrelationship and development of IoT. Yane\
    \ [80] discussed various methods to design the IoT\narchitecture for agriculture\
    \ wherein the Agriculture information technology (AIT) concept\nwas used to analyze\
    \ the features of agriculture data. Ma et al. [81] reported the use of sensor\n\
    networks design on IoT in agriculture for monitoring the crops, and the design\
    \ is evaluated\nusing parameters such as reliability, cost, interoperability,\
    \ and management to ensure\nthe right design. Hu et al. [71] proposed the concept\
    \ of embedding the IoT applications\nwith crops growth, which makes the system\
    \ adaptive and intelligent by experimenting\non different ﬁelds. All these abovementioned\
    \ studies emphasized the challenges faced in\ndeveloping an intelligent system.\n\
    According to International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), IoT implementation\n\
    should increase agricultural yields by 70% within the coming thirty years. In\
    \ fact, IoT is well\nequipped to tackle problems encountered by today’s growers.\
    \ There are a large number of\nsmart technologies within the Agritech sector that\
    \ are designed to satisfy farmers. On-site\nmonitoring of watering, planting,\
    \ crop intake, and pest levels allows for more effective site\ncontrol. The most\
    \ common use for IoT in agriculture is in considering weather patterns.\nThe unsettled\
    \ nature of climatic conditions mean that expected crop yields change regularly.\n\
    Changes in the elements, such as humidity, temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and\
    \ wind, can\nbe monitored from sites in speciﬁc ﬁelds. The delicate nature of\
    \ cultivating under glass\nmeans that constant monitoring is needed. Therefore,\
    \ many opportunities are there to\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n17 of 26\nintroduce\
    \ smart technologies for assisting this from afar, as they are readily able to\
    \ monitor\nvariables such as light, humidity, temperature, and atmospheric compositions,\
    \ as well as\nadjust them to keep within a desired range. The ability to transmit\
    \ real time warnings when\nlevels are exceeded ensures operational efﬁciency.\
    \ Both indoor and outdoor farming spaces\nare suitable for smart sensor installations,\
    \ and can lead to a stronger, more uniﬁed approach\nto agricultural management.\
    \ It is anticipated that any such system should aim to interface\nfreely with\
    \ other smart elements aimed at account and procurement management, so that\n\
    whole system efﬁciency may be maximized. The data collected from sensors monitoring\n\
    soil moisture, humidity, and crop condition can be analyzed using a variety of\
    \ pre-planned\nor adaptive techniques in a smart system, which allows for the\
    \ irrigation of said crops to\nbe dynamically managed.\nUsing the environmental\
    \ sensors and predeﬁned or self-learning algorithms, a smart\ndistribution system\
    \ provides automatic water supply to the endpoint. For instance, in\nsmart irrigation,\
    \ the sprinkles provide just enough water depending on the reads from\nsoil moisture,\
    \ air humidity, and crop condition sensors. The Industrial IoT has been\na driving\
    \ force behind increased agricultural production at a lower cost. In the next\n\
    several years, the use of smart solutions powered by IoT will increase in agriculture\n\
    operations. Actually, a few of the recent reports tell us that IoT device installation\
    \ will see\na compound annual growth rate of 20% in the agriculture industry.\
    \ Further, the number\nof connected devices (agricultural) will grow from 13 million\
    \ in 2014 to 225 million by\n2024. Clearly, the introduction of 5G technologies\
    \ is likely to radically alter the way that\ncutting edge industries, such as\
    \ the automotive and high-tech sectors, operate. However, it\nhas less obvious,\
    \ but similarly wide scale application within agriculture, an area which\nhas\
    \ historically been resistant to change. Tasks such as pest, fertilizer, and water\
    \ level\nmonitoring, ﬁeld condition analysis, livestock tracking, and the control\
    \ of drone operated\nmachinery are ideally suited to 5G connectivity. Although\
    \ many sectors receive beneﬁts\nfrom 5G implementation, in the world’s overall\
    \ economic growth, the agricultural sector\nmust be initially focused as it will\
    \ readily assist by allowing for more data to be collected\nthat can be used in\
    \ the dynamic management of agricultural sites such as farms.\n3.5. Risk Management\n\
    There are four recognized strategies to manage the effects of climate change.\
    \ The\nﬁrst one aims to lower the levels of GHG released. The second one aims\
    \ to weatherproof\nour current way of living. The main goal of the third strategy\
    \ is to determine intentional\nanthropogenic change as a means of directly countering\
    \ the unintentional ones. The fourth\nand ﬁnal strategy aims to better understand\
    \ the climate itself, and thus offer more forward-\nthinking approaches to minimizing\
    \ humanity’s effects [82,83]. Lowering the extent of\nGHG release ensures that\
    \ the fraction of the earth’s atmosphere that they comprise should\nbe reduced\
    \ in the future. This in turn means that climate change should decrease, and\n\
    increases the likelihood that society remains able to mitigate the worst of its\
    \ effects. Multiple\nemission reduction strategies can be employed to reduce GHG\
    \ releases, such as regulation,\ninnovative technology application, conservation,\
    \ public education, or either ﬁnancial\nincentives or penalties for greater or\
    \ lower emissions [84].\nIn the view of the climatologists, there are two competing\
    \ futures depending on\nwhether society acts to tackle climate change. The ﬁrst\
    \ assumes failure, and results in\nhigher temperatures and many new threats, while\
    \ the other requires that global mean\ntemperatures do not exceed the two-degree\
    \ threshold (above pre-industrial measures),\nwhich must be met through combative\
    \ strategies, by 2100 at the latest. Thus, the risks\nassociated with climate\
    \ change are either physical, whereby responses seek to tackle\ntheir negatives,\
    \ and preventative measures associated with transitional arrangements\nseeking\
    \ to move society to a cleaner, green future. Although there is a clear need for\n\
    collaborative action in terms of society’s response to the broader problems identiﬁed,\n\
    individual enterprises can all play their part at a smaller scale. To this end,\
    \ the design\nand implementation of a climate resilience adaptation strategy is\
    \ recommended by Zurich.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n18 of 26\nThey further\
    \ elaborate on this ideal, suggesting that concerns should be identiﬁed and\n\
    mitigated at both macro and micro scales if a business is to be secure. Larger\
    \ enterprises\nshould seek to address their greenhouse gas emissions as part of\
    \ their overall business\nstrategies moving forward; this is particularly pertinent\
    \ to those with high levels of carbon\ndioxide excretion, which may be well assisted\
    \ or retarded by the outlook of their governing\nboards.\nBusinesses have an extensive\
    \ risk management toolbox available to them. A common\nmethod for managing risk\
    \ is to utilize Zurich’s Total Risk Proﬁling (TRP) as a means of\nidentifying,\
    \ quantifying, and mitigating threats based on ideal response protocols. An\n\
    example of this may be found by considering the suitability of the Post Event\
    \ Review\nCapability (PERC) as a means of reviewing instances of ﬂooding. This\
    \ is carried out\nby determining all aspects of resilience, control, and mitigation,\
    \ seeking to ensure that\ncurrent best practice protocols remain up to date, and\
    \ identifying those which need to be\nfurther improved. Through this tool, Zurich\
    \ is capable of providing consultancy services\nto those seeking to address a\
    \ range of climate related concerns. Two of the most desirable\ninnovations from\
    \ the perspective of tackling anthropogenic climate change are the carbon\ncapture\
    \ and electricity storage technologies, since both have clear and immediate beneﬁts\n\
    to the global threat. Research is continuing apace in both regards, since the\
    \ longer it takes\nfor a solution to be implemented, the greater the problems\
    \ associated with the collective\nfailure to act will be, more time will be required\
    \ to rectify them, and thus exists ever greater\nthreats of adverse weather damage.\n\
    For risk managers, the IoT revolution is often about grappling with new risk exposures\n\
    and potential changes to liability, rather than enjoying the exciting potential\
    \ of these new\ntechnologies. However, that is no longer so because IoT is now\
    \ producing very real\nbeneﬁts for the risk profession. The IoT devices envision\
    \ a future where interoperable,\nreliable, secure, and efﬁcient digital devices\
    \ communicate and are linked by appropriate\ncommunication technologies. These\
    \ digital devices help in generating big volumes of\nsensitive data with a high\
    \ processing speed. Such information is helpful in empowering\nusers but imposes\
    \ a great cost of data loss or data misuse. As data complexity, technology\nand\
    \ pervasiveness grow, so does the argument to perform risk management [85]. The\n\
    efﬁciency of IoT with 5G technology will be better and highly effective on risk\
    \ management,\non the positive side.\n3.6. Economic Management\nAs well as the\
    \ potential damage to the earth and its inhabitants, the economy on which\nthey\
    \ depend is also threatened by climate change. To combat this threat, the response\n\
    must be devised between both public and private enterprises as a means of ensuring\
    \ that\nfuture economic growth is sustainable [86]. High temperatures negatively\
    \ affect the human\ncondition and make it harder to work efﬁciently, while a tropical\
    \ storm’s capacity to destroy\nmillions of livelihoods in an instant can decimate\
    \ local economies and communities. The\noccurrence of acute water shortages damage\
    \ crop yields, meaning that less food is available\nto feed an ever expanding\
    \ population that is rapidly approaching ten billion people (World\nPopulation\
    \ Prospects 2019, United Nations Organization) [87]. A stark comment from the\n\
    World Bank acknowledges the risk that in the coming decade, a further 100 million\
    \ people\ncould be classed as impoverished because of the effects of climate change.\n\
    Despite acknowledgement and implementation for the remedial measures, climate\n\
    change has been slow in the capitalist society wherein more and more enterprises\
    \ are\nshowing their eagerness to do their part to tackle this global crisis.\
    \ This in itself offers\nthe perfect chance to change our collective outlook to\
    \ ensure sustainable processes are\nembedded into global culture. This is further\
    \ incentivized by a World Commission report\non the Economy and Climate (2018),\
    \ which estimates that wholesale tackling of climate\nchange could generate over\
    \ 65 million employment opportunities in the low carbon sector,\nwhich is accompanied\
    \ by a potential proﬁt margin of USD$26 billion in the coming decade.\nVarious\
    \ strategies have been adopted to reduce the GHG emissions from the development.\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 9720\n19 of 26\nThe adaptation strategies make the communities\
    \ more resilient to the effects of a changing\nclimate. Smart growth strategies\
    \ also bring environmental beneﬁts and provide economic\nadvantages to local governments\
    \ and the private sector. In addition, they can save people\nmoney on energy and\
    \ transportation, which is particularly important for low-income\nresidents, and\
    \ helps to protect human health. In recent years, the evaluation of climate\n\
    change’s effects became more important because the effects are becoming more noticeable.\n\
    National level risk assessment ensures that governors are adequately prepared\
    \ to develop a\nresponse, since they have already quantiﬁed their available physical\
    \ and human resources,\nensuring their focus on policy development. Singapore’s\
    \ status as a ﬁnancial city state and\nclear personal need for global climate\
    \ change mitigation means that it is well incentivized\nto offer insurance policies\
    \ to its near neighbors. As such, over two hundred ﬁrms are\ncompeting to provide\
    \ insurance coverage to the Asian market.\nSeveral Singaporean institutes have\
    \ focused on climate change, such as the Institute\nfor Catastrophe Risk Management\
    \ (ICRM) at Nanyang Technological University. This\nis a young enterprise, having\
    \ only a decade of operation, but is the ﬁrst Asian team to\nfocus on this ﬁeld.\
    \ As well as its titular aim, it seeks to form joint ventures with other\nrelevant\
    \ teams in China/Japan. Insurance brokers beneﬁt from their research, since it\n\
    allows for accurate assessment of the ﬁnancial risk and gains to be made that\
    \ result from\nclimate change. The Earth Observatory of Singapore, like ICRM,\
    \ seeks to identify the local\neffects of this global problem, with a particular\
    \ focus on those caused by the Indian Ocean\nDipole and the Western Paciﬁc Warm\
    \ Pool. The Centre for Hazards Research (CHR) at\nNUS has a highly localized approach\
    \ and clearly targets Singapore’s infrastructure and\nthe ways in which it can\
    \ advance as a means of mitigating the threats posed by natural\ndisaster. The\
    \ emergent 5G network technologies have appreciably lower latency, higher\ncapacity,\
    \ and higher bandwidth compared to 4G technologies. Certainly, 5G technologies\n\
    have far-reaching impacts on the living and working standard of Singaporeans.\

    \ a\ncity into a smart city, contributing to reaching a high level of urban sustainable\
    \ development\nand improved quality of life for its citizens.\nSmart cities technologies,\
    \ smart grids, and smarter energy use have become prominent\nthemes in recent\
    \ years. There is little doubt that these technologies are spreading and\ngrowing\
    \ in inﬂuence [90]. As well as playing a crucial role in improving cities and\
    \ their\ninfrastructures, smart buildings can also signiﬁcantly enhance the comfort\
    \ of residents.\nThis is because they improve energy efﬁciency, available services,\
    \ quality of life, safety\ncontrols, and general comfort. Many different deﬁnitions\
    \ for ‘smart building’ have been\nput forward, most of which are based on energy\
    \ efﬁciency and the concept of a “smart\ngrid”. Intelligent management systems\
    \ contain features that enable mass data to be stored\nand analysed. Thus, when\
    \ implemented in buildings, they can signiﬁcantly enhance\nenergy management.\
    \ This is because electrical devices on a grid can learn and adapt\nto new behaviours,\
    \ which is essentially what makes them ‘intelligent’ building systems.\nTherefore,\
    \ services that incorporate IoT and Big Data technologies are intelligent because\n\
    they employ vast amounts of data in analytics and automatic learning [91]. 2019\
    \ is the ﬁrst\nyear of 5G commercialization. Seeing the urgent need for the planning\
    \ and development\nof 5G smart cities across the country, 5G-led ubiquitous sensor\
    \ networks have become a\ncornerstone of smart city development; meanwhile, the\
    \ unique ability of 5G networks to\nmeet differentiated smart city needs, smart\
    \ edge systems have been built on 5G and other\ntechnologies for collaborative\
    \ intelligence. The below table (Table 2) summarizes several\napplications of\

    \ Recommendations and Future Works\nThis comprehensive literature survey revealed\
    \ the promises of 5G network technology\napplications in smart cities. However,\
    \ the following challenges need to be overcome\nthrough a set of recommendations\
    \ for which further works are essential:\ni\nThe concept of the smart city will\
    \ continue to evolve. Yet, only the developed countries\nare engaged in such experimentation\
    \ and implementation. Singapore is one of the\nleading nations taking initiatives\
    \ to employ citywide sensor data to monitor daily life.\nSingapore’s Smart Nation\
    \ program encompasses current technology infrastructure\nto create an online connection\
    \ for all the involved communities. Smart cities have\nwide-ranging beneﬁts that\
    \ can be applied to any urban area. Hence, future studies\non cost-effective design\
    \ and implementation are essential to increase the focus on the\nsmart city concept\
    \ globally. It is also vital to include renewable energy sources so as\nto safeguard\
    \ the viability of city operations, addressing the various issues related to\n\
    the non-renewable energy sources;\nii\nFuture smart cities should comprehensively\
    \ examine the big data analytics of the\nexisting smart cities;\niii\nIn the connected\
    \ environments, it is critical to safeguard the security of sensitive\ndata, because\
    \ in the case of any doubt, the citizens may not utilize the ICT platforms,\n\
    thereby decreasing the city operations’ viability and reliability. Hence, a key\
    \ area for\nfuture research may be the implementation of collective security measures\
    \ in smart\ncities;\niv\nThe other area that requires an in-depth investigation\
    \ is the optimization of the\nadvantages of diverse devices. Further analyses\
    \ are required because smart cities\nintegrate a range of subsystems at the application\
    \ layer in order to provide reliable\nand efﬁcient services. Due to its universal\
    \ accessibility, the web inspired WoT concept\nis considered as an ideal element\
    \ to combine diverse applications. Consequently,\nsmart city constituents can\
    \ effectively intercommunicate regardless of any conﬂicting\ncomponents in the\
    \ communication technologies or operational platforms.\n6. Conclusions\nClimate\
    \ change is the most signiﬁcant challenge towards achieving sustainable de-\n\
    velopment because it threatens to drag millions of people into grinding poverty.\
    \ Lately,\nseveral countries have taken bold steps to confront an emerging urban\
    \ crisis with multiple\ndimensions including the damage to the quality of life\
    \ caused by GHG emissions and\nthreats of climate change. There is an urgency\
    \ to develop policies that support green and\nsmart city innovation. An all-inclusive\
    \ overview of the relevant literature on the upcom-\ning 5G network technology\
    \ application in Singapore allowed us to draw the following\nconclusions:\ni\n\
    The necessity of a high bandwidth, low latency, and customized network for support-\n\
    ing various network-related requirements including smart facilities management\
    \ that\ncannot be fulﬁlled with the current networks was demonstrated;\nii\nThe\
    \ 5G technologies-enabled smart cities concept has been prioritized in Singapore\n\
    to maintain public comfort within the buildings, energy efﬁciency, environmentally\n\
    friendliness, and intelligence. It is expected that the intelligent buildings\
    \ in the near\nfuture will become more signiﬁcant in the context of large buildings;\n\
    iii\nLow rise institutional buildings and schools have the potential to achieve\
    \ zero or\npositive energy targets ﬁrst;\niv\nThe smart management of energy,\
    \ wastes, water resources, agricultures, risk factors,\nand economy adopted in\
    \ smart cities can remarkably contribute to reducing climate\nchange, thus attaining\
    \ the sustainability goals.\nv\nThe smartest management depends on the applications\
    \ of the developed technologies\nsuch as IoTs, artiﬁcial intelligence, and so\
    \ forth. In fact, 5G network technology can\nprovide ultra-high transfer speeds,\
    \ ultra-low latency, ultra-reliable experiences, ultra-\nhigh connection density,\
    \ ultra-high trafﬁc density, and ultra-high mobility access to\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 9720\n22 of 26\nthe users. In addition, it can offer enhanced networks\
    \ spectral and energy efﬁciency\nat lower operational and maintenance costs;\n\
    vi\nSingapore has committed to reducing GHG emissions remarkably by 2030. The\n\
    buildings sector, which consumes more than one-third of the country’s total electricity,\n\
    can play a major role in reducing the carbon footprint upon implementing the concept\n\
    of smart cities, mitigating climate change.\nvii\nIn short, the new 5G network\
    \ technology will have substantial positive inﬂuence on\nenergy, waste, risk,\
    \ water resources, and economic management, thereby leading to\nmore sustainability\
    \ with lower climate change impacts.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

  analysis: 'GNSS has advanced significantly, particularly in the realm of autonomous
    agricultural management systems. The convergence of the GNSS components with other
    sensing technologies, such as IoT and machine learning, has unlocked new possibilities
    for precision agriculture. This review highlights the role of GNSS in the following
    key areas:


    * **Data Acquisition**: GNSS provides precise location and timing data for data
    collection and transmission in real-time.

    * **Remote Sensing**: Satellite-based remote sensing technologies, like NDVI,
    LiDAR, and UAVs, rely on GNSS for accurate georeferencing and data collection.

    * **Computer Processing**: GNSS enhances the accuracy of geostatistics, precise
    point positioning, and simultaneous localization and mapping, enabling data processing
    and analysis for precision agriculture applications.


    Several national studies have also adopted GNSS in precision agriculture, with
    the United States leading the way. Multi-constellation receivers and advanced
    algorithms have improved positioning accuracy and robustness, particularly in
    challenging environments. The Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning are also
    gaining traction, leveraging GNSS data to enhance data collection and analysis
    capabilities.


    Despite these advancements, challenges remain, such as signal blockages, multipath
    interference, and atmospheric conditions. Ongoing research and development efforts
    are necessary to overcome these challenges and maximize the potential of GNSS
    in transforming agricultural practices toward greater precision, efficiency, and
    sustainability.'

    \ Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in precision agriculture (PA) represent\
    \ a\ncornerstone for ﬁeld mapping, machinery guidance, and variable rate technology.\
    \ However, recent\nimprovements in GNSS components (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and\
    \ BeiDou) and novel remote sensing\nand computer processing-based solutions in\
    \ PA have not been comprehensively analyzed in scientiﬁc\nreviews. Therefore,\
    \ this study aims to explore novelties in GNSS components with an interest in\
    \ PA\nbased on the analysis of scientiﬁc papers indexed in the Web of Science\
    \ Core Collection (WoSCC).\nThe novel solutions in PA using GNSS were determined\
    \ and ranked based on the citation topic\nmicro criteria in the WoSCC. The most\
    \ represented citation topics micro based on remote sensing\nwere “NDVI”, “LiDAR”,\
    \ “Harvesting robot”, and “Unmanned aerial vehicles” while the computer\nprocessing-based\
    \ novelties included “Geostatistics”, “Precise point positioning”, “Simultaneous\n\
    localization and mapping”, “Internet of things”, and “Deep learning”. Precise\
    \ point positioning,\nsimultaneous localization and mapping, and geostatistics\
    \ were the topics that most directly relied\non GNSS in 93.6%, 60.0%, and 44.7%\
    \ of the studies indexed in the WoSCC, respectively. Meanwhile,\nharvesting robot\

    \ of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in precision\nagriculture (PA)\
    \ has revolutionized farming practices, offering signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms\n\
    of improved efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability [1]. GNSS technologies,\
    \ such\nas GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, have been widely adopted in PA applications\n\
    worldwide [2]. GPS, originating from the United States, has been utilized since\
    \ its full\noperational capability was achieved in 1995. Its development traces\
    \ back to the 1970s as a\nmilitary project. Similarly, GLONASS, developed by Russia,\
    \ reached full operational status\nin 1995 after a development process initiated\
    \ in the 1970s for military purposes. Galileo,\ninitiated by the European Union,\
    \ commenced its services in 2016, offering an independent\nglobal navigation system\
    \ with primary civilian purposes. In contrast, BeiDou, developed\nby China, initially\
    \ provided regional services in 2000 and achieved global coverage in\n2020. These\
    \ GNSS systems are a cornerstone in various well-documented aspects of PA,\nincluding\
    \ ﬁeld mapping [3], agricultural machinery guidance and steering [4,5], variable\n\
    rate technology (VRT) [6], and yield monitoring [7].\nGNSS receivers, in conjunction\
    \ with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allow\nfor exact ﬁeld boundary determination\
    \ and accurate mapping of ﬁeld features such as\nroadways, irrigation systems,\
    \ and drainage networks [8]. This data provides the foundation\nfor further precision\
    \ agricultural activities such as VRT, yield monitoring, and crop scouting.\n\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1417\n2 of 17\nA thorough understanding of the ﬁeld’s characteristics\
    \ and spatial variability allows for\nthe optimization of input utilization, customizing\
    \ management strategies, and waste\nminimization, resulting in enhanced resource\
    \ efﬁciency and cost savings [9]. The precise\nguidance and automated steering\
    \ capabilities of GNSS-based systems contribute to more\nconsistent seed placement,\
    \ fertilizer application, and other ﬁeld operations, resulting in\nimproved crop\
    \ uniformity, optimized input usage, and increased yields [10]. Map-based\nVRT\
    \ systems utilize GNSS positioning to deliver site-speciﬁc applications of inputs,\
    \ such\nas fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation water [11]. By integrating\
    \ GNSS data with yield\nmaps, soil maps, and other relevant spatial information,\
    \ these data are used for the creation\nof prescription maps that guide VRT equipment\
    \ to apply inputs at different rates according\nto the speciﬁc needs of different\
    \ areas within a ﬁeld [12]. VRT systems further enable\noptimization of input\
    \ usage, minimizing environmental impact and maximizing crop\nproductivity by\
    \ adjusting inputs to the speciﬁc requirements of different soil types, nutrient\n\
    levels, and crop growth stages. Yield monitoring has been signiﬁcantly improved\
    \ through\nthe use of GNSS in PA [13]. GNSS receivers integrated with yield monitoring\
    \ systems\nprecisely measure and map crop yields across the ﬁeld. By correlating\
    \ yield data with other\nspatial information, such as soil maps and management\
    \ practices, valuable insights for\nfuture growing seasons are produced into the\
    \ factors inﬂuencing yield variability within\na ﬁeld [14].\nDespite the gains,\
    \ there are still several research gaps in the use of GNSS in PA that\nneed to\
    \ be ﬁlled. One disadvantage is the reliance on satellite transmissions, which\
    \ can\nbe hampered by signal blockages and atmospheric conditions [15]. Satellite\
    \ signals may\nbe obscured or diminished in locations with extensive vegetation,\
    \ tall structures, or steep\nterrain, resulting in lower positioning accuracy\
    \ [16]. Such constraints can have an impact\non the dependability and robustness\
    \ of GNSS-based systems, especially in complicated\nagricultural settings. As\
    \ a result, more research and development are required to improve\nsignal reception\
    \ and processing algorithms in order to offset the impacts of signal blockages\n\
    and multipath interference [17]. Another GNSS restriction in PA is the requirement\
    \ for\nprecise and up-to-date georeferenced data for optimal decision-making [18].\
    \ While GNSS\noffers precise location data, the accuracy of other spatial data\
    \ layers like soil maps, yield\nmaps, and topography data might vary [19]. Therefore,\
    \ efforts should be made to improve\ndata collection methods, data integration,\
    \ and data validation processes to ensure the\navailability of accurate and high-quality\
    \ spatial data for PA applications. Additionally, there\nis a need for user-friendly\
    \ and interoperable PA software and hardware solutions [20]. The\ncomplexity of\
    \ GNSS-based systems and the lack of standardization can present challenges\n\
    in terms of system integration, data compatibility, and ease of use [21].\nWhile\
    \ advancements in GNSS technologies have shown great potential in revolu-\ntionizing\
    \ farming practices, there are notable differences in the adoption and acceptance\n\
    of these solutions globally [6,22]. Among the scientiﬁc studies indexed in the\
    \ Web of\nScience Core Collection (WoSCC), there is a strong recognition of the\
    \ beneﬁts of GNSS\ntechnologies in PA [23–25]. However, present reviews on this\
    \ topic did not consider the\nlatest state-of-the-art GNSS improvements nor GNSS-based\
    \ solutions in PA due to their\nrapid development. Therefore, the aim of this\
    \ review is to provide an up-to-date analysis\nof the role of GNSS in PA, its\
    \ latest development stages relevant to PA, and remote sensing\nand computer processing-based\
    \ novel solutions using objective metrics from the WoSCC.\nThe development of\
    \ low-cost hardware and software solutions in PA has the potential of\nrapidly\
    \ increasing its implementation in agricultural practice and thus indirectly leading\
    \ to\neven larger advancements in research.\n2. Methodology of WoSCC Search for\

    The United States was the global leader in the total scientiﬁc papers indexed\
    \ in the\nWoSCC with the topics of GNSS in combination with both “agriculture”\
    \ and “precision\nagriculture” (Figure 2, Table 2). China and India were the second\
    \ and third-ranked countries\nin terms of scientiﬁc production, with China as\
    \ the leading country for its native BeiDou\nsystem. Despite falling behind these\
    \ three countries in terms of quantitative research\nnumbers, several European\
    \ countries (France, Germany, England, and Spain) were among\nthe leading countries\
    \ in PA research based on GNSS. While the majority of the world\ncountries had\
    \ scientiﬁc contributions in this ﬁeld, the vast majority of African countries\n\
    had no presence in the analyzed papers. Moreover, they would likely greatly beneﬁt\
    \ from\nintroducing GNSS in PA in greater quantity [39,40].\nIn addition to individual\
    \ system developments, the integration of multiple GNSS\nsystems has gained prominence\
    \ in PA. Multi-constellation receivers are becoming more\nprevalent, allowing\
    \ for simultaneous reception and processing of signals from different\nGNSS systems\
    \ [41]. This integration leverages the strengths of each system, improves\npositioning\
    \ accuracy, and enhances the availability of satellite signals, especially in\
    \ environ-\nments where signal blockages are common, including dense vegetation\
    \ and other physical\nstructures [42]. In terms of signal processing, the latest\
    \ developments in multi-constellation\nreceivers focus on advanced algorithms\
    \ that optimize the utilization of signals from mul-\ntiple constellations [43].\
    \ By combining signals from multiple constellations, the receivers\ncan mitigate\
    \ the effects of signal blockages, multipath interference, and ionospheric dis-\n\
    turbances [44]. This results in more reliable and precise positioning information,\
    \ even in\nchallenging environments such as densely vegetated areas or urban landscapes.\
    \ Another\nnotable development in multi-constellation receivers is the integration\
    \ of additional sensors\nto complement the GNSS positioning information. Inertial\
    \ Measurement Units (IMUs)\nare commonly integrated into these receivers to provide\
    \ measurements of acceleration\nand angular rates [45,46]. The combination of\
    \ GNSS and IMU data enables the estimation\nof attitude, velocity, and position\
    \ with higher accuracy and improved robustness. This\nintegration is particularly\
    \ beneﬁcial for PA applications that involve dynamic machinery op-\nerations,\
    \ such as autonomous vehicles or robotic systems [47]. The precise positioning\

    \ absolute positioning using GNSS provides a moderate level of positioning geo-\n\
    metric accuracy, typically within a few meters [49]. However, for the precise\
    \ operations\nrequired in PA, additional correction techniques are employed to\
    \ enhance the accuracy\nto the centimeter level. One such method is the Satellite-Based\
    \ Augmentation System\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1417\n6 of 17\n(SBAS), which employs\
    \ additional geostationary satellites to transmit correction data, thus\nimproving\
    \ accuracy and integrity. For higher accuracy requirements, Real-Time Kinematic\n\
    (RTK) positioning is widely adopted [4], frequently as a Continuously Operating\
    \ Reference\nStation (CORS) network, consisting of permanent reference stations\
    \ that monitor satellite\nsignals and provide correction data through internet\
    \ or wireless communication. These\ncorrections are transmitted to the rover receiver\
    \ in real time, allowing the rover to correct\nits position with centimeter-level\
    \ accuracy. RTK offers real-time feedback and is partic-\nularly useful for dynamic\
    \ agricultural operations where immediate accuracy is crucial,\nsuch as autosteering\
    \ and precise implement control [50]. Network RTK further improved\nthe possibilities\
    \ of RTK by utilizing a network of reference stations instead of a single\nbase\
    \ station [51]. These reference stations are commonly distributed over a wide\
    \ area and\ncollect GNSS observations continuously. Network RTK enables precise\
    \ positioning over\nlarger areas, eliminates the need for a local base station,\
    \ and enhances system ﬂexibility\nand availability. It is particularly beneﬁcial\
    \ for large-scale PA operations, where a single\nbase station may not provide\
    \ adequate coverage [52,53]. Another advanced method is\nReal-Time eXtended (RTX),\
    \ a satellite-based correction service provided by various com-\nmercial providers.\
    \ RTX corrections are computed by a network of reference stations that\ncollect\
    \ GNSS observations and send them to a centralized processing center [54]. The\
    \ center\ncalculates precise correction data and broadcasts it to users via geostationary\
    \ satellites or\ninternet connections. RTX offers wide-area coverage and eliminates\
    \ the need for a local\nbase station, making it suitable for operations in remote\
    \ areas, especially when real-time\ncommunication infrastructure is limited or\
    \ unavailable [55].\nBoth multi-constellation receivers and GNSS corrections,\

    \ [56]. When combined with GNSS technology, NDVI \nmeasurements are accurately\
    \ georeferenced, allowing for spatially explicit analysis and \nmonitoring of\
    \ crop conditions [57]. While multispectral sensors are traditionally mounted\
    \ \non satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite-based multispectral\
    \ sensors, \nsuch as those onboard satellites like Landsat and Sentinel, provide\
    \ broader coverage of \nlarge agricultural areas [58]. GNSS technology aids in\
    \ the precise geolocation of satellite \nimages, allowing for accurate mapping\
    \ of NDVI values across the agricultural landscape \n[59]. Because satellite imagery\
    \ is available in near-real-time, it allows for time-series anal-\nysis and monitoring\
    \ of vegetation dynamics throughout the growing season [60]. The \nhandheld or\

    \ the most widely used vegetation index in PA that provides valuable insights\n\
    into plant health and vegetation vigor [56]. When combined with GNSS technology,\
    \ NDVI\nmeasurements are accurately georeferenced, allowing for spatially explicit\
    \ analysis and\nmonitoring of crop conditions [57]. While multispectral sensors\
    \ are traditionally mounted\non satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ satellite-based multispectral sensors,\nsuch as those onboard satellites like\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel, provide broader coverage of large\nagricultural areas\
    \ [58]. GNSS technology aids in the precise geolocation of satellite images,\n\
    allowing for accurate mapping of NDVI values across the agricultural landscape\
    \ [59].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1417\n8 of 17\nBecause satellite imagery is available\
    \ in near-real-time, it allows for time-series analysis and\nmonitoring of vegetation\
    \ dynamics throughout the growing season [60]. The handheld or\ntractor-mounted\
    \ radiometer is another type of sensor used for NDVI measurements [61,62].\nGNSS\
    \ receivers are commonly supplemented to these portable or tractor-mounted devices,\n\
    allowing for the exact localization of NDVI readings in speciﬁed ﬁelds.\n4.2.\
    \ LiDAR\nLiDAR is complementary to vegetation indices, such as NDVI, by providing\
    \ informa-\ntion on the 3D structure of crops and the surrounding environment\
    \ [63]. The hardware used\nin PA, LiDAR systems includes a variety of components\
    \ designed to acquire and analyze\nprecise 3D information, including GNSS for\
    \ the precise georeferencing of point clouds [64].\nAirborne LiDAR sensors, which\
    \ include lasers, scanning mechanisms, and detectors, are\noften installed on\
    \ UAVs [65]. The laser beams image the plant canopy, terrain elevation,\nand crop\
    \ structural elements. GNSS technology is critical in these systems because it\
    \ allows\nfor exact georeferencing of LiDAR data by syncing the sensor’s location\
    \ and orientation\nwith the acquired measurements [66]. The aircraft or UAVs’\
    \ GNSS receivers should provide\nprecise location and timing information, ensuring\
    \ that the LiDAR data is spatially aligned\nwith the agricultural area. Ground-based\
    \ LiDAR sensors provide high-resolution data\nat a smaller scale, allowing for\
    \ detailed analysis of crop structure and individual plant\ncharacteristics [67].\
    \ GNSS technology is employed in ground-based LiDAR systems to\nprecisely georeference\
    \ the acquired data, linking the 3D measurements to their speciﬁc\nspatial locations\
    \ within the ﬁeld.\n4.3. Harvesting Robot\nUnlike NDVI and LiDAR, harvesting robots\
    \ provide more tangible hardware-based\nresults in PA, signiﬁcantly improving\
    \ the process of crop harvesting by automating labor-\nintensive tasks [68]. The\
    \ GNSS technology enables these robots to navigate and operate\nwith precise geolocation\
    \ information, enabling efﬁcient and accurate harvesting operations.\nRGB cameras,\
    \ as one of the key sensors used in harvesting robots, capture high-resolution\n\
    color images of the crops, allowing the robot to visually identify and locate\
    \ mature or ripe\nfruits or vegetables [69]. By integrating GNSS for accurate\
    \ localization and computer vision\nwith RGB cameras for crop detection and identiﬁcation,\
    \ these robots can navigate through\nﬁelds and perform precise harvesting operations.\
    \ The use of computer vision with RGB\ncameras in harvesting robots provides several\
    \ beneﬁts and opens up new opportunities\nin the ﬁeld of PA [70]. RGB cameras\
    \ image the crops, which are subsequently analyzed\nwith computer vision algorithms\
    \ to extract the color, shape, texture, and other visual\ncharacteristics of crops\
    \ to differentiate between ripe and immature fruits and vegetables [71].\nThe\
    \ force/torque sensor allows the robot to detect how much force is needed to harvest\
    \ the\ncrops without harming them. When paired with GNSS technology, this sensor\
    \ guarantees\nthat the harvesting robot delivers the necessary force with accuracy,\
    \ resulting in safe and\nefﬁcient harvesting operations.\n4.4. Unmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicles\nPA researchers recognized UAVs during the past decade as a cost-effective\
    \ and efﬁcient\nmeans of data collecting and processing [57,72]. When integrated\
    \ with GNSS technology\nand advanced positioning techniques such as RTK and Post-Processing\
    \ Kinematic (PPK),\nUAVs provide very accurate and exact geolocation capabilities,\
    \ which improve the efﬁciency\nof data collecting and processing in PA. PPK is\
    \ a post-processing approach in which the\nUAV captures raw GNSS data during ﬂight\
    \ and then reﬁnes the georeferencing after the\ndata is downloaded and processed\
    \ ofﬂine [73]. PPK processes raw GNSS data from both\nthe UAV-mounted receiver\
    \ and the ground-based reference station to provide positioning\ninformation.\
    \ This method reduces the requirement for real-time communication between\nthe\
    \ UAV and the reference station, allowing for more data-collecting ﬂexibility\
    \ [74]. PPK is\nespecially beneﬁcial in locations with little or no real-time\
    \ communication infrastructure\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1417\n9 of 17\nsince data\
    \ may be gathered and analyzed later when connectivity becomes available.\nFurthermore,\
    \ incorporating RTK or PPK capabilities into UAVs improves their autonomous\n\
    navigation capability [75]. UAVs may follow predetermined ﬂight paths independently\n\
    with very accurate positional information, boosting data-collecting efﬁciency\
    \ and coverage.\nThis is especially useful when scanning large agricultural regions\
    \ or doing repeated ﬂights\nto track crop growth and changes over time [76]. The\
    \ integration of GNSS into UAV aerial\nspraying systems reduces the risk of spraying\
    \ outside the designated zone, minimizing\nenvironmental impact and optimizing\
    \ resource utilization [77]. Moreover, GNSS improves\nthe safety of UAV aerial\
    \ spraying operations through post-spraying analysis and evaluation.\nThe accurate\
    \ positioning information recorded during the ﬂight can be integrated with\nother\
    \ environmental data to assess the efﬁcacy of the spraying operation, identifying\
    \ areas\nthat require additional treatment or monitoring and optimizing future\
    \ spraying strategies.\n5. GNSS in State-of-the-Art Computer Processing-Based\
    \ Solutions in PA\nAmong the computer processing-based citation topics micro that\
    \ are related to GNSS\nand PA, geostatistics is a dominant and well-accepted discipline,\
    \ while the following\nsolutions represent recent novelties (Figure 5). In comparison\
    \ with the remote sensing-\nbased solutions, those based on computer processing\

    \ of soil sampling is collecting a restricted number of samples\nfrom a ﬁeld,\
    \ as it is an expensive and time-demanding procedure, and evaluating them in a\n\
    laboratory [78]. To provide an overview of the analyzed soil property in the entire\
    \ ﬁeld,\ngeostatistics was proven as an effective method for quantifying soil\
    \ variability [79]. Kriging\nis the most well-known geostatistical approach for\
    \ estimating values at unsampled sites\nusing a collection of observed values\
    \ at neighboring places [80]. The Kriging approach\ndescribes the spatial autocorrelation\
    \ of the data using a mathematical model called a\nvariogram, which is a measure\
    \ of how similar the values of the data are as a function of\nthe distance between\
    \ them [79]. In PA, kriging has been widely utilized to map the spatial\nvariability\
    \ of soil, vegetation, and topography features [81,82].\nBecause soil parameters\
    \ must be precisely georeferenced in order to evaluate spatial\nautocorrelation,\
    \ GNSS has become an indispensable instrument in PA for soil analysis [83].\n\
    GNSS data may also be used to generate digital elevation models (DEMs), which\
    \ give\ninformation on the ﬁeld’s topography [84]. DEMs may be used to identify\
    \ ﬁelds prone\nto waterlogging or erosion and to design drainage systems that\
    \ reduce exposure to these\nevents [85]. GNSS, combined with geostatistics, may\
    \ also be used to collect agricultural\ngrowth and production variability data.\
    \ The yield data may be used to generate yield\nmaps that depict crop yield spatial\
    \ variations across the ﬁeld using geostatistics, identifying\nzones with high\
    \ or low production potential and modifying fertilizer and irrigation rates\n\
    accordingly [86]. Site-speciﬁc management using VRT, for example, is a PA strategy\
    \ that\nemploys geostatistics and GNSS to adjust management practices to speciﬁc\
    \ sections of the\nﬁeld [87]. This method makes better use of inputs, eliminates\
    \ the danger of over-application,\nand lessens the environmental effect of agricultural\
    \ activities [88].\n5.2. Precise Point Positioning\nBy providing a real-time centimeter-level\
    \ accuracy based on a single GNSS receiver,\nPrecise Point Positioning (PPP) provides\
    \ additional ﬂexibility in positioning in PA [41].\nPPP employs a network of reference\
    \ stations to give precise GNSS satellite orbit and clock\ninformation, which\
    \ is utilized to determine the receiver antenna location [89]. PPP can be\nutilized\
    \ in places where no reference stations exist, making it especially beneﬁcial\
    \ in isolated\nor rural locations. It is also less susceptible to atmospheric\
    \ and ionospheric disturbances,\nwhich can cause inaccurate positioning with RTK\
    \ and differential GNSS (DGNSS) [90].\nSince PA requires high-precision mapping\
    \ of soil parameters and crop yields in con-\njunction with geostatistics, PPP\
    \ supports the detection of spatial heterogeneity in the ﬁeld.\nPPP may also be\
    \ effectively utilized for agricultural machinery guidance by giving precise\n\
    real-time location information to agricultural machines along speciﬁed courses\
    \ [91]. This\nenables VRT of inputs like fertilizer and herbicides precisely where\
    \ they are required,\nlowering input costs while also limiting environmental effects.\
    \ These systems have several\nadvantages over manual steering, including enhanced\
    \ efﬁciency, less operator fatigue, and\nimproved safety [92]. While manual guiding\
    \ systems are simple and inexpensive, they\nare also susceptible to human mistakes,\
    \ which can lead to unnecessary inter-row overlaps\nand skips [4]. Assisted guiding\
    \ systems are more precise than manual guidance systems,\nbut steering corrections\
    \ must still be made by the operator. Autosteering systems, on\nthe other hand,\
    \ take full control of the machinery and direct it along a predeﬁned course\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1417\n11 of 17\nautomatically [93]. These systems use PPP\
    \ or other GNSS correlations with a variety of\nsensors to deliver positioning\
    \ information and automatically perform steering corrections.\nIn addition to\
    \ the GNSS receiver, IMUs and cameras are also employed to offer additional\n\
    information about the vehicle’s surroundings and to assist the autosteering system\
    \ in\nmaking precise steering adjustments [94].\n5.3. Simultaneous Localization\
    \ and Mapping\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a PA technology\
    \ that includes\nbuilding a map of an area while also determining the position\
    \ of a robot or vehicle within\nthe environment [95]. The positioning information\
    \ from GNSS signals is used to identify\nthe robot’s location inside the surroundings\
    \ in relation to a set of speciﬁed landmarks [96].\nOther sensors, including LiDAR,\
    \ cameras, and IMUs, can also be used by SLAM to produce\na comprehensive map\
    \ of the surroundings. The production of precise maps of ﬁelds and\norchards is\
    \ an important use of GNSS-based SLAM in PA [97]. GNSS-based SLAM may\nalso be\
    \ utilized for precise agricultural machinery guiding [98]. As irrigation is another\n\
    important part of agriculture, precision irrigation may assist in minimizing water\
    \ use while\nboosting crop yields. By producing precise maps of the ﬁeld topography,\
    \ it is possible\nto recognize places within the ﬁeld that require irrigation\
    \ and apply water just where it\nis required [99].\n5.4. Internet of Things\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a critical tool in PA, allowing farmers\n\
    to collect real-time data from sensors and devices strategically placed across\
    \ their ﬁelds\nand farms [100]. GNSS technology is vital in IoT-based PA, delivering\
    \ precise location and\ntiming data that is required by many IoT applications\
    \ [101]. The collection of environmen-\ntal data such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ and soil moisture is one of the key uses of IoT in\nPA [102]. For these sensors,\
    \ GNSS technology offers accurate position information, guaran-\nteeing that the\
    \ data is connected to the proper location inside the ﬁeld or farm. Monitoring\n\
    livestock health and well-being is another application of IoT in PA [103]. IoT\
    \ sensors may\nbe ﬁtted to cattle to monitor vital indications like heart rate,\
    \ respiration rate, and body\ntemperature, providing early warning of health concerns\
    \ that could jeopardize the animals’\nwell-being [104]. GNSS technology may be\
    \ used to track the movement of animals inside\nthe farm, allowing farmers to\
    \ monitor grazing patterns and detect underused farm regions.\n5.5. Deep Learning\n\
    Deep learning has emerged as a strong tool for precision agricultural data analysis.\
    \ GNSS\ntechnology offers precise geolocation data for satellite images, enabling\
    \ deep learning algo-\nrithms to monitor crop growth and development across time\
    \ [105]. Deep learning algorithms\nmay identify parts of a field that may require\
    \ more irrigation, fertilizer, or pest control methods\nby evaluating patterns\
    \ in satellite imaging data [106]. Patterns and trends that may suggest\ninadequate\
    \ growing conditions may be recognized by evaluating data acquired with IoT\n\
    sensors using deep learning algorithms [107]. This data may be used to change\
    \ irrigation\nand fertilization schedules, ensuring that crops receive the appropriate\
    \ amount of water and\nnutrients at the appropriate time. GNSS technology may\
    \ be used to geolocate these sensors,\ngiving the sensor data geographical context\
    \ and allowing for more precise analysis [108].\nConvolutional Neural Networks\
    \ (CNNs) are commonly utilized in PA for image processing,\nenabling recognition\
    \ of specific crop traits or growth phases by utilizing GNSS technology\nto offer\
    \ precise geolocation information [109]. Overall, deep learning has the potential\
    \ to\nimprove various present technologies as flexible tools in PA, including\
    \ UAV imaging [110],\nsatellite imagery analysis [111], and livestock monitoring\
    \ [112].\n6. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, recent major upgrades in all four individual\
    \ GNSS components have\nsigniﬁcantly improved their overall performance in PA.\
    \ The upgrade of constellations\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1417\n12 of 17\nwith new,\
    \ modernized satellites, such as GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou, along with the\naddition\
    \ of new signals, particularly in GPS and BeiDou, have been the most prominent\n\
    advancements. The United States has emerged as the global leader in scientiﬁc\
    \ research\non GNSS in combination with precision agriculture (29.3% of global\
    \ studies), followed\nby China with 11.6% of global studies. European countries,\
    \ including France, Germany,\nEngland, and Spain, have also made signiﬁcant contributions\
    \ to PA research based on\nGNSS, especially in the research based on individual\
    \ GNSS components. However, the\nmajority of African countries have had limited\
    \ presence in the analyzed papers, despite\ntheir potential to greatly beneﬁt\
    \ from the introduction of GNSS in PA.\nThe integration of multiple GNSS systems\
    \ has gained prominence in PA, with multi-\nconstellation receivers becoming more\
    \ prevalent. This integration leverages the strengths\nof each system, improves\
    \ positioning accuracy, and enhances satellite signal availability,\nespecially\
    \ in challenging environments with signal blockages. Advanced algorithms in\n\
    multi-constellation receivers optimize the utilization of signals from multiple\
    \ constellations,\nmitigating the effects of signal blockages, interference, and\
    \ disturbances. Additionally,\nthe integration of additional sensors, such as\
    \ IMUs, further enhances positioning accu-\nracy and robustness, particularly\
    \ for dynamic machinery operations in PA applications.\nThe analyzed studies indicate\
    \ that PA has the potential to advance even further with\nthe help of GNSS technology\
    \ thanks to the integration of remote sensing and computer\nprocessing-based solutions\
    \ like NDVI, LiDAR, harvesting robots, unmanned aerial vehi-\ncles, geostatistics,\
    \ PPP, SLAM, IoT, and deep learning. PPP, SLAM, and geostatistics were\nparticularly\
    \ dependent on GNSS research, with 93.6%, 60.0%, and 44.7% of studies indexed\n\
    in WoSCC matched with the GNSS in topic search, respectively.\nNevertheless, there\
    \ are still a number of research gaps that need to be ﬁlled in order to\nfully\
    \ utilize GNSS in PA. The main drawbacks of signal blockages, multipath interference,\n\
    and atmospheric circumstances have been addressed in recent studies on the subject.\
    \ These\nfactors can impair the resilience and dependability of GNSS-based systems,\
    \ as well as\nthe most advanced GNSS-based solutions for PA. To overcome present\
    \ challenges and\nmaximize the potential of GNSS in transforming agricultural\
    \ practices toward greater\nproductivity, sustainability, and efﬁciency, ongoing\
    \ research and development efforts in\nGNSS are still required. To ensure the\
    \ availability of precise and high-quality spatial data for\nprecision agricultural\
    \ applications, efforts should also be made to improve data-gathering\ntechniques,\
    \ integration, and validation procedures. In order to solve issues with system\n\
    integration, data interoperability, and simplicity of use, it is also necessary\
    \ to develop\nuser-friendly and interoperable precision agricultural software\
    \ and hardware solutions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.R.; methodology,\

    DOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, no other invention\
    \ has generated as much\nexcitement in the computing world as the Internet. Because\
    \ of its\ntremendous strength and breadth of uses, it is virtually ubiquitous\n\
    in every sector of human endeavor (Kumar et al., 2017; Poyen et al.,\n2020; Terence\
    \ and Purushothaman, 2020). People and\norganizations have connected with amazing\
    \ agility and\nconvenience in recent years, thanks to a vast 5G network of\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs), healthcare services, cellphones,\nand various sorts\
    \ of pervasive real-time monitoring systems\n(Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju, 2019;\
    \ Hassan et al., 2021). The\nhuman population is expanding at an alarming rate,\
    \ but at the same\ntime, pollution is slowly depleting the earth’s water and land\n\
    supplies. Smart agriculture is seen as playing a crucial role in\nresponding to\
    \ these issues. Smart agriculture has the potential to\nvastly enhance both the\
    \ agroecological setting and the yield and\nquality of agricultural products while\
    \ simultaneously decreasing the\nneed for harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ (Zhang et al.,\n2022). The use of ICTs to automate and intelligently manage\n\
    agricultural cultivation and production is central to the concept\nof “smart agriculture.”\
    \ In particular, wireless communications play\na signiﬁcant role in the growth\
    \ of agriculture, and each new\ngeneration of wireless communication technology\
    \ propels farming\ntoward a higher level of intelligence.\nPeople and objects\
    \ may connect in real-time thanks to the 5G\nnetwork-based Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), which provides important\nservices and value to millions of people across\
    \ the world (Guevara\net al., 2020; Biswal et al., 2021). 5G network-based IoT\
    \ has\ndeveloped organically into a gigantic technology platform. South\nAmerica\
    \ has initiated a yearly warm-season tomato yield that\nbelongs to the Solanaceae\
    \ family (Van Eck et al., 2019; Kumar\net al., 2022).\nDespite requiring high\
    \ amounts of fertilizer, tomato is a\npopular or demanding plant due to its health\
    \ signiﬁcance to the\nwhole world, with high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoid,\n\
    lycopene, and vitamins C and A and phenolic compounds, which\nprovide a wide range\
    \ of health advantages for the consumers\n(Campestrini et al., 2019; Samanta et\
    \ al., 2020; Chen P. et al.,\n2021). Tshiala and Olwoch reported that tomatoes\
    \ have been used\nin food preparation throughout the world as fresh vegetables\
    \ or as\nspices. It has a vital role in the Ethiopian marketing of vegetables\n\
    (Guodaar et al., 2020; Biswas et al., 2021). The production of\ntomatoes was used\
    \ as a job opportunity and as an income source\nfor producers.\nNutrient and water\
    \ supplies have a signiﬁcant impact on tomato\nquality, and their highest water\
    \ demand is quoted in an unpublished\npaper. Some poisonous elements and inorganic\
    \ substances that are\ndangerous to people can demonstrate water quality (Sanjuan-Delm´\n\
    as et al., 2020; Chen P. et al., 2021). This may be a problem for\nirrigation\
    \ using municipal wastewater. Although municipal\nwastewaters have been applied\
    \ as much as possible to irrigation,\nthey contain comparatively maximum sodium\
    \ quantities that can\nbe accumulated with this wastewater and have toxic effects\
    \ on plant\nsoils during optimized irrigation (Jayalakshmi and Gomathi, 2019;\n\
    Leuther et al., 2019; Casadei et al., 2021). The various types of crop\ngrowth\
    \ models are extremely useful in optimizing irrigation\npractices which are based\
    \ on physical or semi-empirical equations\nfor simpliﬁcation of the complex mechanism\
    \ and also having many\nparameters in the process (Sanjuan-Delm´as et al., 2020).\
    \ Because\nof its balance of simplicity, accuracy, and robustness, the AquaCrop\n\
    model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\nhas provided a\
    \ method for calculating crop yields and optimal\nirrigation scheduling for various\
    \ crops in different climates. In the\ncurrent real-time model, parameters like\
    \ soil moisture (SM), crop\ncultivation, leaf area index (LAI), or canopy cover\
    \ (CC) are\ncollected using various remote sensing devices. As a result, this\n\
    real-time cultivation process is an upgraded and fully dynamic\nversion of the\
    \ traditional models (Leuther et al., 2019; Chen P.\net al., 2021).\nA fast and\
    \ dependable Internet connection is necessary for\nagricultural IoT devices to\
    \ function. The current generation of\nmobile networks is failing due to insufﬁcient\
    \ connectivity in rural\nareas, and even in areas with high-speed access, failure\
    \ occurs due to\nmassive demand. According to a recent survey, nearly 80% of rural\n\
    areas, even in the United Kingdom, are outside of the 4G range. The\ncurrent degree\
    \ of network access in rural areas is insufﬁcient in most\nnations (Tang et al.,\
    \ 2021). In addition, in some developed\ncountries, there are multiple farms with\
    \ a large number of IoT\ndevices and machines that require a constant reliable\
    \ high-speed\nInternet connection to exchange a large amount of data, and the\n\
    technologies of the current generation of mobile networks cannot\ncope with these\
    \ demands (Singh et al., 2022). To fulﬁll these goals,\nmany promising technologies,\
    \ such as massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO), network slicing, and\
    \ smaller cells, are\nneeded to provide reliable connectivity over a larger distance.\n\
    Therefore, the smart mobile network is well suited to support\nsmart farming by\
    \ enabling wide coverage, low-energy\nconsumption, low-cost devices, and high\
    \ spectrum efﬁciency.\nUnfortunately, the IoT-based network’s usage of microwaves\n\
    (MWs) as carriers limits its ability to cover wide areas. The\nintroduction of\
    \ small base stations spaced at roughly 250 m\nintervals over coverage regions\
    \ that can be extended to any size\nallows for continuous connectivity, thanks\
    \ to the small cell\nconcept. In order to link the bigger areas, the related small\n\
    towers can be placed everywhere (on lamp posts, in trees, on\nroofs, on tops of\
    \ vehicles, etc.). Similar to 4G, this implementation\nmakes use of the massive\
    \ MIMO approach by equipping nodes\nwith many antennas for sending and receiving\
    \ data in order to\nincrease the network’s capacity. On the other hand, huge MIMO\n\
    makes signal interference more likely. Beamforming is used to\nincrease the throughput\
    \ of transmitted data and thereby solve this\nissue. Beamforming refers to an\
    \ antenna’s capability of directing\nfocused beams of radio waves at speciﬁc targets.\
    \ An advanced\nInternet connection provides very high (MW) operating\nfrequencies,\
    \ and the accompanying high bandwidth makes it\npossible for larger and more rapid\
    \ data transactions. In contrast\nto the static channels used by the 4G network,\
    \ the cognitive radio\napproach used by the smart network allows for device-speciﬁc\n\
    channel allocation.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant\
    \ Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nIn 2017, for the ﬁrst time, the 5G RuralFirst\
    \ project successfully\nplanted and harvested a crop using autonomous tractors\
    \ to sow\nseeds, drones to monitor crops, and machines to apply water,\nfertilizer,\
    \ and pesticides. The entire procedure was carried out\nwithout the need for any\
    \ laborers. Another initiative, Hands Free\nHectare, claimed a successful harvest\
    \ in 2018 (Al-Ghobari and\nMohammad, 2011). With greater technological breakthroughs,\
    \ 5G\nis projected to promote precision farming. As IoT-based network\ncoverage\
    \ grows, agricultural sector producers will beneﬁt greatly,\nallowing them to\
    \ manage farms, animals, and other assets from the\ncomfort of their own homes,\
    \ thanks to their big capacity, fast data\nspeed, and low latency. Smart technology\
    \ will help to advance IoT\nsensor connectivity to the next level, paving the\
    \ way for\nunprecedented innovation in smart farming components.\nImplementing\
    \ technology to automate, track, and monitor\nagricultural processes is a wise\
    \ solution to the irrigation problem.\nThe traditional irrigation method is fully\
    \ automated by using IoT\nintegration modules. However, with an advanced network\
    \ on the\nhorizon, smart agriculture will take off with lightning-fast\ndata transfer.\n\
    To improve farm produce quality, smart farming combines\ntraditional agronomic\
    \ practices with the IoT. The application of\nnew technology in agriculture can\
    \ assist farmers in reducing labor\nand costs while increasing crop yield and\
    \ production. To facilitate\nall of these agricultural beneﬁts, the IoT includes\
    \ a wide range of\ncomponents under digital and automated technologies. So, IoT-\n\
    based connectivity will vastly increase the impact due to low latency,\nhigh bandwidth,\
    \ and support for many sensors communicating at\nthe same time.\nThe IoT technology\
    \ platform already helps to increase\nproductivity and ensure proper resource\
    \ utilization through\nprecision agriculture. The implementation of IoT, on the\
    \ other\nhand, will help to accelerate the entire process with machine-to-\nmachine\
    \ services. The real-time data transfer capabilities of the IoT\nmodule can aid\
    \ in the rapid operation of these solutions, making\ndecision-making quick, robust,\
    \ data-oriented, and real-time. With\nan IoT-based network, these devices can\
    \ send real-time data about\nthe need for optimal irrigation, spoilt crops, and\
    \ their location to\nfollow-up machinery. Farmers can save time and money by\n\
    harvesting crops quickly and effectively with automated irrigation\nfor tomato\
    \ crop cultivation.\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n•\n\
    An efﬁcient IoT-based framework is proposed for tomato\ncultivation.\n•\nMoisture\
    \ levels in the soil are predicted with the help of IoT\nmodules to optimize the\
    \ irrigation system.\n•\nA mobile application is also developed that can help\
    \ farmers\nby providing useful information.\nThe remaining parts of the paper\
    \ are arranged as follows. Section\n2 discusses the literature review. Section\
    \ 3 explains the things used\nfor designing smart farming solutions. Section 4\
    \ details the proposed\nsystem and the methodology. The simulation setup and results\n\
    analyses are described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2 Literature\
    \ review\nChen et al. (2019) discussed the proper utilization of water for\nthe\
    \ growth of tomatoes by using the fuzzy neural network with a\ngenetic algorithm\
    \ (GA). It predicted the volume of irrigation based\non the effect of greenhouse\
    \ and the growth of crops (Guha et al.,\n2021). Rodrı́guez et al (Rodr´ıguez-Ortega\
    \ et al., 2019). developed a\nsoilless technique to yield tomato crops through\
    \ the treatment of\nsalinity. Here, the salinity treatment was speciﬁcally used\
    \ to\nimprove the production of vegetables and nutritional imbalance\n(psychological\
    \ of plants) for crops. Zhai et al. (2015) proposed an\nidea for the cultivation\
    \ of tomatoes using saline water and the\nblossom-end rot technique. Implementing\
    \ these two yield methods\nenhanced the level of production.\nIn the study of\
    \ Shao et al. (2014), two levels of irrigation\ntechniques were designed for heavy\
    \ rain shelters and drainage\ntreatments for improving the productivity of crops.\
    \ An optimum\nirrigation management technique was designed for yielding quality\n\
    tomatoes through the proper arrangement of rain shelters (Keswani\net al., 2020;\
    \ Maroli et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2021). In the study of\nGil et al. (2019),\
    \ the smart grid system monitored the precision for\nirrigation of water on demand\
    \ using IoT. The authors added\ndesalination and solar energy processes in the\
    \ agricultural system\nfor efﬁcient cultivation.\nKrishna et al. (2017) designed\
    \ a smart farming method for\nintelligent water-saving irrigation using the Raspberry\
    \ Pi module\nand sensors. So, it automated the yielding of crops in a higher range\n\
    that regulates through IoT modules. Qiu et al. (2020) implemented\nan in-depth\
    \ process to collect phenotypic parameters for measuring\nthe growth of tomatoes.\
    \ This system precisely calculated the\ndeﬁciency of water level and fertilizer\
    \ with the help of a neural\nnetwork algorithm for the growth cycle of tomato\
    \ (Khamparia et al.,\n2020; Biswal et al., 2021). An intelligent irrigation system\
    \ was\ndeﬁned as the water requirement for the yielding of tomatoes\nduring a\
    \ various range of climate states by Mason et al. (2019). In\nthis study, smart\
    \ irrigation was used in an adverse situation through\nproper integration of the\
    \ IoT module, sensors, and connectionless\nenvironments (Chen M. et al., 2021).\n\
    In the agriculture industry, 4G/3G/NB-IoT wireless network\ntechnology is used\
    \ to connect IoT-based smart devices for the\npurposes of data sharing, precise\
    \ assessment, accurate calculation,\netc (Dell’Uomo and Scarrone, 2002). Although\
    \ the 3G/4G\nnetworking paradigm has shown much promise, there are still\nseveral\
    \ obstacles that may prevent it from being used to its full\npotential in the\
    \ agriculture sector. One of the main restraints is the\navailable working space.\
    \ Existing wireless networks do not reach out\nto rural areas or dense urban neighborhoods.\
    \ Channel\ncircumstances, resource allocation, ﬂuctuating data rates, and\nhandoff\
    \ problems between diverse networks all make it difﬁcult to\nfacilitate quality\
    \ of service (QoS) in 4G networks (Payaswini and\nManjaiah, 2014; Payero et al.,\
    \ 2017). Mobile devices in this network\nhave a short lifespan due to the utilization\
    \ of many antennas and\ntransmitters. Many modern agricultural sectors rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered technologies like drones and robots, but these have limited\n\
    usefulness in far-ﬂung crop ﬁelds. The number of IoT devices used\nSingh et al.\n\

    \ smart farming, as well as the amount of research done on these\ndevices, is\
    \ growing rapidly, necessitating greater intelligence, speed,\nscalability, secure\
    \ communication capabilities, and processing\npower to handle the numerous complex\
    \ computational tasks and\nheavily utilized services. Having ultralow latency\
    \ in addition to high\nconnection is necessary for IoT devices to achieve quick\n\
    performance and low costs.\nThe current 4G networks (LTE) are limited in their\
    \ ability to\nenable such functionalities because they only permit connectivity\n\
    through IP-based packet switching (Zhaogan et al., 2007). The shift\nto 5G cellular\
    \ networks will eliminate these problems caused by\nprevious generations of wireless\
    \ technology. Due to advancements\nin 5G connectivity, farmers now have the option\
    \ of remotely\npiloting a drone over extensive distances, either manually or via\n\
    predetermined checkpoints (Faraci et al., 2018; Sinha and\nDhanalakshmi, 2022).\
    \ A farmer can get high-deﬁnition video\nstreams and other critical sensory data\
    \ and telemetry from drones\nin real time over the 5G cellular network, which\
    \ is more efﬁcient\nand reliable than previous-generation mobile networks\n(Bhattacharya\
    \ and De, 2021). Due to 5G technology, drones will\nnot need to carry a lot of\
    \ computing power and instead can upload\ntheir data to the cloud, where it will\
    \ be processed more quickly.\nTo demonstrate the importance of smart agriculture,\n\
    Thilakarathne et al. (2023) show a cloud-enabled, low-cost\nsensorized Internet\
    \ of Things platform for monitoring and\nautomating processes related to a tomato\
    \ plantation in a\ncontrolled indoor setting. We hope that the information gleaned\n\
    from this study will be used as a foundation for advancing smart\nagriculture\
    \ solutions that boost productivity and quality and pave\nthe way for a more sustainable\
    \ future.\nUsman et al. (2022) present a 6G use case for plant health\nmonitoring\
    \ using a terahertz (THz)-signal-based integrated\nsensor and communication system.\
    \ Precision agriculture is best\nunderstood as a smart management system with\
    \ the capacity to\ntrack and regulate plant health and water levels on both a\n\
    microscopic and a macro scale. The objective is to maximize\noutput while minimizing\
    \ waste of scarce resources. THz-based\nsensing technology, which can evaluate\
    \ plant health on a cellular\nlevel, combined with wireless sensor networks installed\
    \ within\ncrops to monitor multiple variables while making intelligent\ndecisions,\
    \ could have signiﬁcant implications for agriculture. A\nsustainable communication\
    \ infrastructure that takes into account\nthe needs of dispersed and adaptable\
    \ agricultural settings is\nnecessary for the integration and operation of such\
    \ a macro–\nnano-sensor system.\n3 Materials and methods\nThe growth and productivity\
    \ of plants depend mainly on how\nmuch water is formed during the seedling phase.\
    \ During this time,\nwater demand has an important effect on crops, which have\
    \ many\nenvironmental aspects like temperature, quality of soil, etc. The\napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture is limitless, which provides various\nintelligent devices\
    \ to improve yielding performance and proﬁt\n(Gomathy et al., 2020; Sivakumar\
    \ et al., 2020). However, there are\nvarious issues with investing in smart cultivation\
    \ and also difﬁculty\nin the development of agriculture-related IoT apps (Kamienski\n\
    et al., 2019; Conesa et al., 2021).\na) Hardware unit:\nThe information will inﬂuence\
    \ the development of IoT\nsolutions for farming, and there is a need to select\
    \ sensors to\ncreate the custom device that will collect data for the proposed\n\
    solution (Althar and Samanta, 2021; Guha and Samanta, 2021;\nZhang et al., 2021).\
    \ However, the quality of the sensors has a crucial\npart in production which\
    \ depends on the exactness of the collected\ndata and its consistency.\nb) Brain\
    \ unit:\nSmart agriculture should be used as data analytics for a design\nsolution\
    \ that will be helpful if yeomen cannot make sense of it, so\nthere is a need\
    \ to use powerful data analytics techniques and relate\npredictive algorithms\
    \ and machine learning methods for\ncollecting data.\nc) Maintenance unit:\nHardware\
    \ maintenance is a signiﬁcant challenge for IoT-based\nagriculture, while the\
    \ sensors are commonly used in the crop ﬁeld.\nThere are more chances for damaged\
    \ sensors, which needs to be\naddressed by making a smart device that is robust\
    \ and easy to\nsustain. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced with another sensor.\n\
    d) Mobility stage:\nSmart farming applications can be remotely monitored through\n\
    a smartphone or desktop computer for transmitting related yielding\ninformation\
    \ to the owner (Maheswari et al., 2021; Mekala et al.,\n2021). The integration\
    \ of devices should be autonomous and also\ncover enough wireless range to communicate\
    \ and send data to the\ncentral server.\ne) Infrastructure unit:\nA solid and\
    \ robust internal infrastructure needs to ensure that\nthe intelligent cropping\
    \ process performs well and securely handles\nthe data load in it.\nIf the process\
    \ disables the security, someone easily breaks the\nentire system and steals related\
    \ data or controls intelligent devices.\n3.1 Agricultural/crop production system\n\
    The cultivation model can be used to monitor or calculate the\namount of native\
    \ agricultural products, depending upon the\ncultivated area and supported by\
    \ the decision support system\n(Nagarajan and Minu, 2018). Figure 1 shows the\
    \ agricultural/crop\nproduction prediction factors.\nThe number of exports and\
    \ imports of agricultural products can\nbe derived from the prediction model of\
    \ the National Statistical\nOfﬁce’s (NSO) statistics database as depicted in this\
    \ section. The\nagricultural product crop and yielded area models are worked under\n\
    the production of the smart agricultural prediction model, which\nevaluates the\
    \ updated method as well as the predecessor observation\nmethod to reinterpret\
    \ it.\nlnAx,t = a0 + a1lnRPx,t−1 + a2lnRPy,t + a3lnAx,t−1\n(1)\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n04\nwhere\
    \ Ax,t is seeding in x yield design at t year, Ax,t−1 is seeding\nin x yield design\
    \ at t−1 year, RPx,t−1 is the marketplace value in x\nyield design at t−1 year,\
    \ and RPy,t is the market place value in y yield\ndesign at t year.\nY Dx,t =\
    \ b0 + b1WT1\nx,t + b2WT2\nx,t\n(2)\nwhere Y Dx,t is the crop in x yield design\
    \ at t year, WTx,t\n1 is the\nweather (temperature) in x yield design at t year,\
    \ and WTx,t\n2 is the\nclimate (amount of rainfall) in x yield design at t year.\n\
    The quantity of domestic products is the summation of\nagricultural products of\
    \ all individual yield areas and each\nfunctional value of it (Gurunath et al.,\
    \ 2018; Mohanty et al., 2019;\nBenyezza et al., 2021). The agricultural product\
    \ amount is the\nmultiplication of the ﬁeld with the crop model.\nThe demand method\
    \ of the crop is the multiplication of the\ndemand method per method in addition\
    \ to the demands of the\nwhole community. The resource purposes of agricultural\
    \ products\ndepend on export and import scenarios and other supporting\nfactors,\
    \ as depicted in Figure 1. The above equations must follow\n“Nerlove’s partial\
    \ adjustment model,” and the regional weather\ninformation can help concede the\
    \ prediction although there are\nsome missing values (El-Zawily et al., 2019).\n\
    3.2 Challenges in the purpose system\nDespite the many advantages that the 3G/4G\
    \ networking\nparadigm offers, there are still several obstacles that prevent\
    \ it\nfrom being used to its full potential in the agriculture industry.\nSpace\
    \ constraints pose serious problems. Current wireless networks\nare unable to\
    \ reach more remote places or crowded metropolitan\nneighborhoods. Supporting\
    \ the quality of service (QoS) in 4G\nnetworks is difﬁcult due to channel conditions,\
    \ resource\nallocation, varying data rates, and handoff problems between\nheterogeneous\
    \ networks. Due to the heavy use of antennae and\ntransmitters in this network,\
    \ the lifespan of mobile devices is short.\nIn order for Internet of Things devices\
    \ to deliver quick performance\nat low prices, ultralow latency must be paired\
    \ with a strong\nconnection. Due to the limitations of IP-based packet switching\n\
    connectivity on the existing 4G network (LTE), such features are\nnow unavailable.\
    \ These issues, which have plagued earlier\ngenerations of cellular networks,\
    \ will be eradicated with the\ntransition to IoT-based networks.\nDue to its massive\
    \ data capacity and speeds greater than 10 Gbps,\nIoT-based connection will be\
    \ able to link billions of devices. For both\ndownload and upload speeds, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to be up to 100\ntimes faster than their 4G and 4G LTE predecessors.\
    \ 5G can connect\nbillions of devices due to its increased bandwidth, in addition\
    \ to its large\ndata capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. The download and\
    \ upload\nspeeds of IoT-based networks will be up to 100 times faster than those\
    \ of\n4G and 4G LTE networks. Consequently, a 2-h movie that would take 6\nmin\
    \ to download on 4G would take less than 4 s to download on an\nadvanced network.\
    \ Technical speciﬁcations for 5G are being developed\nby the International Telecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU). The uplink peak\ndata rate is 10 Gbps, and the downlink peak data\
    \ rate is 20 Gbps per\nmobile station. Therefore, an IoT-enabled network is used\
    \ for the\nInternet of Things-based smart irrigation system, which allows for\n\
    remote monitoring of soil moisture and watering.\n3.3 Mobile application\nA mobile\
    \ application is accessed by farmers on farms. Using this\napplication, we can\
    \ make predictions utilizing insight data and the\ncollected cultivation insights\
    \ data (Dhanush et al., 2017; Hota et al.,\n2020; Maheswari et al., 2021). The\
    \ mobile application will provide\ncrop-relevant information like crop health\
    \ alerts, pest control, and\nwarehouse inventory managing warnings as shown below.\
    \ The key\nfeatures of mobile applications are as follows:\n•\nobserving yield\
    \ health facts (nutrient levels, pH levels, etc.)\nthrough the functionality of\
    \ yield inspection (Ahmadi et al.,\n2019),\n•\nthe application of organizing fertilizer\
    \ and insecticides for\nthe farm (Kiryushin, 2019),\n•\nautomating the irrigation\
    \ system and controlling water\nlevels as well as soil health over the farm (Al-Ali\
    \ et al.,\n2019; Li et al., 2020), and\n•\ntracing yield records and checking\
    \ warehouse details (bin\ninventories) (Quitaleg and Ortiz, 2020).\nFIGURE 1\n\

    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\n3.4 Impact of water quality on\
    \ tomato yield\nTomato yield is a broad view that encompasses the interactions\n\
    of various single-quality attributes. Irrigation water salinity\nenhanced tomato\
    \ amounts, fruit thickness, soluble solids, total\nacid, vitamin C, and the sugar–acid\
    \ ratio (Magán et al., 2008).\nFresh tomato yield, canopy diameter, fruit water\
    \ content,\ntomato ﬁrmness, and calcium and nitrogen concentrations\ndecreased\
    \ as water salinity levels increased, whereas increasing\nsalinity levels increased\
    \ texture strength (Shao et al., 2014). In\naddition, saline water irrigation\
    \ increased tomato fruit’s total\nsoluble solids and acidity (pH) by 11.1% and\
    \ 6.9%, respectively.\n3.5 Role of the contactless IR sensors for\ntomato crop\
    \ growth measurement\nThe contactless IR sensors are used to produce infrared\n\
    radiation to measure the plant’s growth from its stem, whereas\nthe radiation\
    \ is converted into some amount of electricity and is less\nthan 10 cm from the\
    \ target. In the proposed system, sensors are\nplaced more than 10 cm from the\
    \ plant, which will measure growth\nby using a method based on the speculation\
    \ of infrared energy. The\nIR sensors are ﬁtted with infrared ﬁlters to avoid\
    \ outside disturbing\nlight. IR sensors are ﬁtted to measure the thickness growth\
    \ of\ntomato crops through the analog output voltage. The energy\nradiations of\
    \ infrared sensors are transformed into distance data,\nwhich is not directly\
    \ propositional to distance data.\n4 Proposed system and methods\nThe evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) crop is described as the amount of\nwater necessary for the perfect growth\
    \ of various crops in\nconnection with the lack of water by evapotranspiration\
    \ which is\ndiscussed in this system. The demand for yielding waters refers to\n\
    an optimally developed harvest, so that a consistent, disease-free\ncrop is actively\
    \ cultivated and completely sheltered. An advanced\nnetwork can connect billions\
    \ of devices due to its increased\nbandwidth, in addition to its large data capacity\
    \ and speeds faster\nthan 10 Gbps. The download and upload speeds of smart networks\n\
    will be up to 100 times faster than those of 4G and 4G LTE\nnetworks. So, this\
    \ method is advantageous in addition to IoT\nmodules, which gives a perfect way\
    \ to produce tomatoes in the\nseasonal and non-seasonal periods. The cultivation\
    \ process is\nmainly inﬂuenced by the following situations like weather, yield\n\
    type, and development stage of the harvest, which is depicted in\nFigures 2, 3.\n\
    The proposed system is integrated with the following\ncomponents which are described\
    \ below:\ni. Arduino Uno microcontroller:\nIt is an open-source microcontroller\
    \ that can be programmed\nby writing C or C++ code to control the overall system\
    \ automation.\nAfter installing and programming the Arduino, it is ready to collect\n\
    the number of inputs from IR moisture soil sensors and also provide\na remote\
    \ command to control the irrigation system. However, this\nmicrocontroller remotely\
    \ controls the overall execution process.\nii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:\nSoil\
    \ moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil\nproperty that plays\
    \ a vital role in a variety of farming activities,\nhydrological processes, and\
    \ environmental concerns. A near-\ninfrared (NIR) reﬂectance sensor is created\
    \ for the calculation of\nmoisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting\n\
    diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of\n1,945 nm and\
    \ a strong water absorption band and the other with a\nwavelength of 1,850 nm\
    \ and a weak water absorption band. It is\nlinked to an Arduino controller to\
    \ record the moisture level of the\nsoil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to\
    \ the water controller for\nirrigation in the tomato cultivation land.\niii. Pinolex\
    \ drip automatic water controller:\nThe smart ﬂower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to manage\nand control tomato crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation\n\
    or anywhere, an automatic water timer is set by the Arduino\nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which is useful for watering tomato cultivation.\nIt ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm)\
    \ thread tap. It can water the plants\nregularly, even when no one is at home,\
    \ and thus improve their\nsurvival rate.\niv. Wi-Fi access point:\nFIGURE 2\n\
    The proposed system for the smart irrigation of tomato yields.\nSingh et al.\n\

    \ high-speed Ethernet wire links a router to an access point,\nwhich transforms\
    \ a connection-oriented signal into a\nconnectionless signal. Connectionless connectivity\
    \ is typically the\nonly available option for base stations, which use Wi-Fi to\
    \ establish\nlinks with destination devices. As a result, the Wi-Fi service is\
    \ linked\nto the 5G Internet, and it then provides a direct link with the end\n\
    user to remotely monitor and control automatic irrigation as well as\ntomato crop\
    \ cultivation.\n4.1 Working principle of the model\nThe purpose model generally\
    \ performs the operation in the\nfollowing steps:\nStep 1:\nFirst of all, the\
    \ NIR contactless sensor observes the moisture\nlevel of the soil. As a result,\
    \ it is connected near the tomato plant to\ncollect soil moisture. A ﬁeld’s soil\
    \ moisture status is critical for\nmaking planting, fertilizer application, and\
    \ irrigation decisions.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, the moisture levels are observed through\
    \ the Arduino\nUno module, which is also linked with a Wi-Fi access point to send\n\
    all the data to the mobile applications with the help of 5G\ntechnology. The 5G\
    \ network helps to gather the moisture levels\nthrough the cloud service and automatically\
    \ regulates the\nirrigation system.\nStep 3:\nWhen the moisture level is monitored\
    \ through the mobile app,\nthen the drip irrigation system is smartly controlled\
    \ through the\n5G-enabled IoT module (Arduino Uno microcontroller).\n4.2 Evaporation\
    \ and\ntranspiration processes\nEvaporation and transpiration happen at the same\
    \ time, and\nthere is no way to talk about them separately. The fraction of solar\n\
    radiation that reaches the cropped soil surface is used to calculate\nevaporation.\
    \ However, once the crop has matured to the point that\nit completely covers the\
    \ soil surface, transpiration becomes the ﬁrst\nprocess. IoT module sensors properly\
    \ calculate the moisture level of\nthe soil with the help of the calculation process\
    \ of ET.\nEvapotranspiration is commonly deﬁned in mm/time, and\nwater quantity\
    \ lost from a cropped plane is deﬁned in water\ndepth units. Because 2 hectares\
    \ has an area of 20,000 m2 and 2\nmm equals 0.002 m, a loss of 2 mm of water corresponds\
    \ to a loss of\n10 m3 of water per hectare. Finally, 2 mm day−1 corresponds to\
    \ 10\nm3 ha−1 day−l.\nThe quantity of energy received per unit area can also be\
    \ used to\ncharacterize water depths, with energy referring to the amount of\n\
    heat or energy required to evaporate free water. The latent heat of\nevaporation\
    \ (l) varies with the temperature of water. At 21°C, for\nexample, l is approximately\
    \ 2.50 MJ kg−1. To put it another way,\n2.50 MJ is required to evaporate 2 kg\
    \ or 0.002 m3 of water.\n4.3 Impact of weather on the yielding\nwater requires\
    \ reference crop\nevapotranspiration ETo\nThe main impact of weather information\
    \ on crop water\nrequirements is sunshine, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.\n\
    FIGURE 3\nTest scenario of the irrigation system.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nThe reference crop evapotranspiration\
    \ deﬁnes the evaporation energy\nof the atmosphere (ETo). Reference crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ also\nknown as reference evapotranspiration, is the evapotranspiration\nrate\
    \ from a reference surface that is not deﬁcient in water and is\nexpressed as\
    \ ETo.\nETo values measured in distinct locations or climates are\nequivalent\
    \ because they indicate identical reference surfaces.\nThese variables inﬂuencing\
    \ ETo can be parameters for climate,\nwhich can be measured using climate information.\
    \ ETo intimates at\na given location, the evaporating energy of the atmosphere.\n\
    In this research domain, different techniques are available for\ncalculating ETo.\
    \ It is tested either by an evapotranspiration pan or\ntheoretically by using\
    \ calculated weather information.\n4.3.1 Saucepan (pan) evaporation technique\n\
    The saucepan evaporation technique allows an environment to\nmonitor the combined\
    \ inﬂuence of temperature, moisture, wind\nspeed, and sunlight on the reference\
    \ yield evapotranspiration ETo.\nThe various evaporation pans are class A evaporation\
    \ pan and\nSunken Colorado pan. The evaporation saucepan is used in the\nfollowing\
    \ equation:\nETo = Kpan \x01 Epan\n(3)\nwhere Kpan is the pan coefﬁcient, Epan\
    \ is the pan evaporation,\nand ETo is the reference yield evapotranspiration.\n\
    4.3.2 Blaney–Criddle technique\nThe Blaney–Criddle method is a theoretical technique\
    \ to\ndetermine the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo, and more\nliterary\
    \ techniques have been used, but many of them were locally\ncalculated. If the\
    \ process is accessed locally, if it is available or if\nlocal procedures are\
    \ not available, then the theoretical method is\nused for the calculation.\nETo\
    \ = P(0:46Tmean + 8)\n(4)\nTmax = omonth(max)\nNdays=month\nTmin = omonth(min)\n\
    Ndays=month\nTmean = Tmax+Tmin\n2\n(5)\nWhere ETo = 1 month of average period,\n\
    Tmean = regular temperature, and\nP = regular proportion of yearly day time periods.\n\
    4.4 Impact of yield type on yield water\nrequires Kc\nThe single crop coefﬁcient\
    \ Kc plays a signiﬁcant role in crop\ncharacteristics as well as the averaged\
    \ effects of soil evaporation.\nAverage crop coefﬁcients are more relevant and\
    \ convenient than Kc\ncomputed on a daily time step using a separate crop and\
    \ soil\ncoefﬁcient for normal irrigation planning and management,\ndevelopment\
    \ of basic irrigation schedules, and most hydrologic\nwater balance studies (Farg\
    \ et al., 2012). The impact of yield type on\nthe yielding water requires dealing\
    \ with the yield type and the\ndevelopment yield stage on water needs. The ﬁeld\
    \ is harvested\nbetween the relationship of reference grown yield and grown yield.\n\
    ETY ield = ETo \x01 Kc\n(6)\nwhere ETYield = yield evapotranspiration process\
    \ (month/day),\nKc = yield inﬂuence, and ETo = reference evapotranspiration. Here,\n\
    ETYield and ETo are stated in equal units in month/day.\n4.4.1 Manipulation of\
    \ the overall growing stage\nFrom the beginning of transplantation to the last\
    \ day, the\noverall growing stage of the crop is determined. It is primarily\n\
    inﬂuenced by the following:\n•\nthe various harvest and its multiplicity,\n•\n\
    the condition of the weather, and\n•\nthe different stages of planting on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\n4.4.2 Manipulation of growth stages\nThe manipulation of the overall\
    \ growing stages of yield is\ndivided into four stages:\n•\nthe analysis of the\
    \ yield ﬁrst stage,\n•\nthe observation of the yield development stage in a ﬁeld,\n\
    •\nthe mid-time cultivation stage, and\n•\nthe late-time growth stage of the crop.\n\
    4.5 Different steps of estimation of the\ncrop water requirement\nThe analysis\
    \ of the requirement of aquatic crops ETcrop is\nevaluated as:\nETcrop = ETo \x01\
    \ Kc\n(7)\n4.5.1 Yield of water quantity requirement of\ntomatoes\nTable 1 shows\
    \ the given details of the crop.\nMethod of calculation:\nStep 1: The distinct\
    \ growth stages of crop estimation are\nconsidered (see Table 2).\nStep 2: The\
    \ month-wise tomato crop’s growth stages are\nobserved (see Table 3).\nStep 3:\
    \ The Kc factor for each of the four stages is estimated as\n(López-López et\
    \ al., 2014):\nKc, the starting stage of the crop = 0.45\nKc, the development\
    \ stage of the crop = 0.75\nKc, the mid–time stage of the crop = 1.15\nKc, the\
    \ late–time stage of the crop = 0.8\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n\

    \ the complete growing\ntime of tomato crop, which is 638 mm.\n5 Simulation setup\
    \ and results analysis\nIn the proposed system, the related experimental data\
    \ are received\nthrough the installed soil moisture and humidity sensor from the\n\
    tomato crop ﬁeld. The NIR REES52 Soil Sensor is used to collect the\npercentage\
    \ of moisture in the soil. Based on this,an irrigation process is\nautomated with\
    \ a developed mobile application which is depicted in\nFigure 4. By using this\
    \ app, the status of soil moisture and the growth of\nplants can be dynamically\
    \ observed, and the irrigation method can also\nbe controlled. Similarly, the\
    \ plant growth parameters like maximum\nheight, width, and diameter of the stem\
    \ of the tomato plant are\nmeasured using an infrared sensor. This is tested in\
    \ a regional area\n28 m in length and 7 m in width, but the experimental site\
    \ is portioned\ninto two rows, and tomatoes are planted 4 m in length and 1.2\
    \ m in\nwidth zone. On the other hand, 50-cm-high PVC plates are applied for\n\
    separation from communities, and a 50-cm row spacing is followed for\nthe plantation\
    \ of tomatoes. Data are captured continuously from the\nﬁeld of cultivation. The\
    \ fog nodes are implemented for sensing data in\nthe area of cultivation. The\
    \ overall implementation of the proposed\nwork is depicted in Figure 5.\nThe cultivation\
    \ time to the collection period is from 1\nNovember 2020 to 18 April 2021, as\
    \ depicted in Figure 6, but it is\ndrawn from the above data (Table 4), which\
    \ is deﬁned in step 5. The\ncultivation of the tomato growth period is evaluated\
    \ as the crop\nsowing period to seedling period (November 1 to December 5), the\n\
    development stage of the crop period (December 6 to January 15),\nthe mid-time\
    \ stage (ﬂowering) of the growth period (January 16 to\nFebruary 5), and the late-time\
    \ stage of growth (fruiting and mature\npicking) period (February 6 to March 30).\
    \ The analysis of irrigation\ndata for tomato cropping depends on the relevant\
    \ factor of the soil\nmoisture sensor at 22 cm depth. This measure predicts the\
    \ volume\nof irrigation.\nBy the observation of moisture level from the above,\
    \ Table 5\nshows a dynamic way of the automatic required level of irrigation\n\
    for tomato cultivation (Figure 7).\nTable 6 shows a feature-wise comparison of\
    \ this paper with the\nexisting literature. The existing work has been mostly\
    \ considered\nunder normal cultivation methods. However, in the proposed work,\n\
    it is found that 5G technology is integrated with the IoT module. As\na result,\
    \ the irrigation system is working intelligently for\nthe cultivation.\nIn Table\
    \ 7, we can see how the 5G network stacks up against\nother existing network generations.\
    \ High-deﬁnition video streaming\nand telephony were made possible on the road\
    \ by 4G networks, an\nimprovement above 3G. As network trafﬁc has increased, the\n\
    theoretical maximum for 4G speeds has been reached. According\nto the ITU, the\
    \ most recent 5G use cases fall into one of three\ncategories: ultrareliable low\
    \ latency communications (URLLC),\nmassive machine type communications (mMTC),\
    \ and enhanced\nmobile broadband (eMBB).\nTable 8 shows that Odisha is in the\
    \ ﬁfth position all over India.\nThis table shows only the seasonal production\
    \ of tomatoes in India.\nIf the display of tomatoes is required to produce in\
    \ non-seasonal\nduration (August to October), then the state Odisha is considered\
    \ in\nthe third position. The implementation of the intelligent cultivation\n\
    method improves the situation in the production table.\nTable 9 shows the exportation\
    \ of tomatoes from India to other\ncountries. The export is done in the seasonal\
    \ duration of\nproduction, but it is required to export in a non-seasonal period\n\
    through intelligent irrigation techniques. Table 10 shows the\nimportation of\
    \ tomatoes to India in the case of seasonal duration.\nThe IoT-based intelligent\
    \ irrigation method provides a technique to\ncultivate tomatoes in the non-seasonal\
    \ period, so that there is no\nneed to import from outside of the country, which\
    \ gives better\nperformance than the traditional cultivation process.\n6 Conclusion\
    \ with future work\nIn this approach, traditional ﬁelds such as agriculture require\n\
    technology (here, smart farming) to achieve higher crop yields with\nless human\
    \ intervention in a limited time frame. Smart farming, on\nthe other hand, necessitates\
    \ signiﬁcant investment, improved\ncoverage and connectivity, and more bandwidth\
    \ to manage the\nTABLE 4 The water requirement for the complete growing time of\

  title: 'Smart high-yield tomato cultivation: precision irrigation system using the
    Internet of Things'
  verbatim_quote1: To overcome this problem, a smart irrigation system was proposed
    by using the IoT framework.
  verbatim_quote2: A mobile application was also developed that can help farmers by
    providing useful information.

  analysis: The paper utilizes AI and IoT techniques for weather prediction and optimization
    of irrigation and fertigation systems to enhance agricultural productivity and
    efficiency in response to unpredictable and rapidly changing weather patterns.
    The authors employ fuzzy inference systems (FIS) to predict rainfall rates and
    machine learning (ML) algorithms to forecast irrigation and fertigation schedules
    based on soil moisture and nutrient content. The paper also presents a prototype
    implementation that integrates weather and farm field data to schedule irrigation
    and fertigation, optimizing water and fertilizer usage while increasing crop yield.

    \ \n \nAbstract \nPurpose: Unpredictable and rapid change in \nweather patterns\
    \ has great impact on agricultural \nactivities, especially for precision agriculture\
    \ that \nresults in worsened water resources availability, \ndecreased soil fertility,\
    \ use of pesticide as well as \ndecreased yield productivity. In attempt to \n\
    alleviate these challenges, this study aims at \ndeveloping a real-time weather\
    \ and farm field \ndata driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) and \nInternet of\
    \ Things (IoT) system that analyze, \nmanage and schedule irrigation and fertigation\
    \ as \nwell as enabling farmers to interact with their \nfarms via Smart phone\
    \ or PCs to optimize energy \nand water resources. \nMethodology: The system employs\
    \ weather \ncondition \nmonitoring \nsensors \nsuch \nas \natmospheric pressure,\
    \ air temperature, air \nhumidity and wind speed for collecting real-time \nfarm\
    \ field data and uses Fuzzy Inference System \n(FIS) to predict rainfall rate\
    \ at farm area for 24 \nhours period. The system also gathers field data \nsuch\
    \ as soil moisture content and soil nutrient \ncontent and uses the Machine Learning\
    \ (ML) \nalgorithms to predict the time for irrigation and \nfertigation. By combining\
    \ weather and farm field \ndata, the system schedules the irrigation and \nfertigation\
    \ activity. In addition, the mobile \napplication is developed for the farmers\
    \ to \ninteract, control and monitor the farming \nactivities and the data is\
    \ presented to the farmers \nin both graphical and numerical formats.  \nFindings:\
    \ The system prototype deployed and \ntested in the two hectors Maize farm proved\
    \ that \n55% of water, 51% of energy and 20% of \nfertilizer were saved as well\
    \ as increases in 20% \nof Maize yield production compared to previous \nseason.\
    \ \nRecommendations: Since the current irrigation \nand \nfertigation \npractices\
    \ \nare \nbased \non \npredetermined time of the day and threshold \nvalues for\
    \ automatic irrigation, this solution \nintroduced the new concept of real-time\

    \         \n \n38 \n \n1.0 INTRODUCTION \nThe world is facing significant challenges\
    \ in meeting the growing demand for food, especially in \ndeveloping countries\
    \ including Rwanda where 90% of its population depends on agriculture and \nits\
    \ population growth is rapidly increasing while farmlands are getting reduced\
    \ as cities \nexpand[1][2]. However, the agricultural sector in Rwanda is facing\
    \ serious challenges including \nclimate change, water scarcity, poor soil fertility\
    \ and the need to improve resource management \nfor sustainable farming practices[3].\
    \ As a result, there is an urgent need to develop innovative \nsolutions that\
    \ can improve agricultural efficiency and sustainability. One such solution is\
    \ the \nintegration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in conjunction with Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technologies \ninto irrigation and fertigation systems, coupled\
    \ with advanced weather prediction capabilities that \nholds great potential to\
    \ enhance agricultural efficiency and sustainability [4]. \nTraditional irrigation\
    \ practices in Rwanda often suffer from inefficiencies due to fixed schedules\
    \ \nand manual assessments, leading to the wasteful use of water and fertilizers\
    \ and decreased crop \nyields[5]. The manual method used in irrigation involves\
    \ building canals which supply uniformly \nwater from water resources or use of\
    \ water pumps for spraying water evenly in the field and not \nonly much water\
    \ is wasted but also is time consuming and requires much more manpower[6]. \n\
    inappropriate fertilizer application due to Lack of knowledge and awareness of\
    \ the farmers, \nresulting in either overuse or underuse, both of which can have\
    \ negative impacts on crop \nproductivity and the environment[7]. Additionally,\
    \ unpredictable weather patterns, such as \nirregular rainfall distribution, can\
    \ further exacerbate the challenges faced by farmers, making it \ncrucial to adopt\
    \ intelligent and automated systems that optimize irrigation and fertigation processes\
    \ \nwhile considering real-time weather conditions[8]. \nIn Rwanda, the Ministry\
    \ of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) in collaboration with \nother\
    \ stakeholders, developed a national ICT4RAg strategy that recognizes the achievements,\
    \ \nchallenges, and opportunities present in mainstreaming ICT in Agriculture[9].\
    \ with the \ndigitalization and automation applications in agricultural production\
    \ processes, the reduction in \ncost and improved efficiency and computational\
    \ power of electronic systems like use of \nautonomous robotic systems, wireless\
    \ sensor network, IoT devices, and the advances in AI and \nmachine learning are\
    \ gaining popularity[10][11].  \nWith machine vision, there is advancement in\
    \ understanding, modelling and crop mapping by \nhyperspectral remote sensing\
    \ using ground-based, truck-mounted, airborne, and space borne \nsensors[12].\
    \ Also, innovative technology solutions such as satellite tracking and aero monitoring\
    \ \ncan support large scale digital farming, strengthen adaptation to climate\
    \ risks, enhance disaster \npreparedness and aid effective planning and management\
    \ of agriculture practices in urban \nAfrica[13]. \nThis paper aims to explore\
    \ the concept of smart irrigation and fertigation with weather prediction \ntechnology,\
    \ its applications in agriculture and its potential for enhancing agricultural\
    \ sustainability. \nThe AI and IoT technologies based on DL and Fuzzy Logic System\
    \ design with mobile application \nare developed as well as hardware components\
    \ are presented. Furthermore, the system prototype \nis developed and deployed\
    \ on the field and research findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of \n\
    smart irrigation and fertigation are discussed. By embracing smart irrigation\
    \ and fertigation \nsystems with weather prediction technology, farmers can overcome\
    \ traditional limitations, \nEuropean Journal of Technology  \n \n \n \nISSN 2520-0712\

    \ \nRelated Works \nThis section of the study presents the up-to-date works done\
    \ related to the use of technology in \nagriculture especially in irrigation;\
    \ IoT based weather prediction application in agriculture is \npresented followed\
    \ by use of IoT technology in irrigation and fertigation and finally application\
    \ of \nAI in conjunction with IoT in irrigation and fertigation is discussed.\
    \ \nAI systems with sensors are used for collecting weather data and predict its\
    \ future petters for \ndecision making. Adaptive-neuro Fuzzy Inference System\
    \ based rain prediction model was \ndeveloped in [14], [15] and the study in [16],\
    \ [17] Recurrent Neuro Network rainfall prediction \nmodel was proposed for irrigation\
    \ purpose. These AI based approaches collected weather data \nincluding temperature,\
    \ humidity, rainfall, wind speed and solar radiation and processes them for \n\
    the purposes of predicting the probable amount of rainfall. The real-time weather\
    \ prediction system \nneeds to be integrated into irrigation and fertigation system\
    \ for optimizing the irrigation \nscheduling[18]. \nIoT technology has been increasingly\
    \ employed in irrigation and fertigation practices to enhance \nresource management,\
    \ optimize crop growth, and improve overall agricultural productivity. Soil \n\
    moisture sensors and actuators have been used in [19], [20][21] for automatic\
    \ irrigation but they \nare based only on threshold values of the moisture in\
    \ the field. A system consisting of soil moisture \nsensors, soil temperature\
    \ sensors, a Raspberry Pi as the MCU, and a water pump is proposed for \nautomatic\
    \ irrigation monitoring[22]. Smart phones was used to communicate in this solution\
    \ and \nthe amount of water they require at different phases of growth are taken\
    \ into account in the solution \nso that the field is irrigated in accordance\
    \ with the calculated water need by the plant [23][24]. The \nintegration of IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data analytics enables real-time monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ndecision-making, and automated control in irrigation and fertigation systems\
    \ as developed in \n[4][21][25]. Soil condition-based Irrigating alone to meet\
    \ the water requirements of the plants may \nnot result in the appropriate levels\
    \ of moisture required, the weather patter variation also have to \nbe considered.\
    \  \nWi-Fi is a widely used wireless communication technique. Many agricultural\
    \ monitoring systems, \nsuch as the one presented in[26] , employ Wi-Fi to communicate\
    \ among  various agents of their \ndesigns. They demonstrated a Wi-Fi wireless\
    \ sensor network for farm monitoring, with nodes \ncollecting data on temperature,\
    \ humidity, light, soil moisture, and water content. The data was also \nsent\
    \ to a server further analysis. As a result, using Wi-Fi coverage in various agricultural\
    \ settings \nis of tremendous interest. The research in[26][27], reported a method\
    \ for estimating the location \nof wireless nodes based on signal intensity. The\
    \ IEEE 802.11 b/g standard was used in the locations \nincluding urban regions,\
    \ rural areas, woodlands, and plantations. However, Wi-Fi requires more \ninternet\
    \ infrastructure when deployed in remote area. \nWSN technology is widely used\
    \ in agriculture as the study in [27], proposes an effective \nmethodology that\
    \ uses WSN as a data gathering tool and a decision support system (DSS) to assist\
    \ \nfarmers with manual or automated watering processes. WSN nodes are placed\
    \ in fields to detect \nand report numerous plant-growth-related factors such\
    \ as moisture, salinity, pH, temperature, air \nhumidity, and wind direction,\
    \ allowing farmers to make informed decisions. DSS examines a \nvariety of indicators\
    \ to identify water-stressed areas, which it then notifies farmers. The adoption\

    of this technology lowered the amount of water used by farmers and the amount\
    \ of work they had \nto undertake[28]. \n2.0 METHODOLOGY \nThis study focused\
    \ on designing an AI-based solution for farmers from a human development \nperspective\
    \ since the solution was designed according to the needs of the farming activities.\
    \ \nConsidering the nature and characteristics of this study, the research setting\
    \ was framed within the \ngeneral methodology of Design Science Research (DSR).\
    \ It started from understanding the \nproblem domain (by exploring soft cases)\
    \ and ended with (a design case) the implementation and \nevaluation of a system.\
    \ Thus, it provided a tentative solution to the problems as found and analyzed\
    \ \nin earlier phases. \nThe system was designed in three main stages including\
    \ determination and prediction of moisture \nand nutrient content in the soil\
    \ using ML model, weather prediction using FIS model as well as \nirrigation and\
    \ fertigation scheduling based on FIS model.  \nMachine Learning (ML) Model  \n\
    The ML model was developed to determine the current and predict the future moisture\
    \ and nutrient \ncontent level in the soil. The model followed the normal steps\
    \ undertaken in any machine learning \nalgorithm. It began with collecting and\
    \ cleaning data for the purpose of preparation for training \nand then converted\
    \ into JSON format and uploaded into the cloud-based machine learning \nplatform.\
    \  The data was also separated into validation set and training sets. The data\
    \ was then pre-\nprocessed so as to generate features for training. After pre-processing\
    \ the machine learning model \nwas designed and the inputs to the model training\
    \ was the soil moisture level and soil nutrient \ncontent. The data was trained\
    \ and validated to get the ML model for the output being classification \nwhether\
    \ there is stress condition in the soil or adequate nutrient content in the soil\
    \ for accurate \ndecision making.  \nFuzzy Inference System \nA Fuzzy Inference\
    \ System (FIS) is a computational model that uses fuzzy logic to make decisions\
    \ \nor predictions based on input data. Firstly, real-time weather condition parameters\
    \ including Air \ntemperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure\
    \ were collected and fed to the \nIf-Then rule based FIS for rainfall patterns\
    \ prediction within 24 hours.   \nDecision Support System: The output from weather\
    \ condition prediction of FIS combined with \nsoil condition prediction from ML\
    \ system were integrated into decision support systems for \nirrigation and fertigation\
    \ management. This FIS provides intelligent recommendations for \nirrigation and\
    \ fertigation practices. Farmers can utilize these recommendations to make decisions\
    \ \nabout water and fertilizer management, optimizing resource utilization and\
    \ crop yields. \nSystem Design and Testing \nThis section presents the proposed\
    \ embedded system level design, testing and obtained results. \nThe architecture\
    \ of the system is first presented and described, followed by the system artificial\
    \ \nintelligence modeling including Machine Learning model for irrigation and\
    \ fertigation decision \nmaking, Fuzzy logic system for weather forecasting and\
    \ finally the whole smart irrigation and \nfertigation is simulated in MatLab\

    \ 51% of energy used and 20% of fertilizers were saved as well as increases in\
    \ 20% \nof Maize yield production compared to previous season. The developed mobile\
    \ application \nfunctioned 100% and was able to indicate all weather forecasting\
    \ and the variation in soil condition \nas determined in the farm field by the\
    \ deployed prototype. In addition, the farmers were able to \ncontrol and activate\
    \ the irrigation and fertigation equipment properly. The results of the physical\
    \ \nsystem deployed in the field corresponded to the results from Matlab simulation\
    \ in Lab at 90% \nand the small difference was due to the law quality of sensors\
    \ used and the slop of the farm land. \n4.0 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  \n\
    This study presents the weather based smart irrigation and fertigation system.\
    \ The proposed \nsolution employes IoT in conjunction with AI technologies to\
    \ monitor and control the irrigation \nand fertigation scheduling process to optimize\
    \ water and fertilizer usage. It uses electronic sensors \nto collect real-time\
    \ data and microcontrollers for processing data, actuators for activation irrigation\
    \ \nand fertigation equipment as well as mobile application for enabling farmers\
    \ to easily monitor and \ncontrol their farm activities. The system prototype\
    \ deployed and tested in the farm showed that the \nhalf of the water and fertilizers\
    \ can be saved as well as reducing number of farm field workers \nwhen this system\
    \ is well used. It is less internet dependent since all data processing are done\
    \ at the \nedge of the network at it can be deployed anywhere even in remote area.\
    \ \nWe recommend the implementation of this solution as it guarantee the effective\
    \ usage of water \nand fertilizer resources which in turn increases the farmer’s\
    \ income. Moreover, it is less expensive \nand user friendly since it doesn’t\
    \ require special knowledge and it can be applied to any type of \ncrops. \n \n\

  limitations: The research does not emphasize the use of various data types for irrigation
    management, instead focusing on weather prediction and its impact on irrigation
    scheduling. The study mainly concentrates on crop yield and resource optimization,
    without exploring other aspects of the irrigation management pipeline, such as
    data transmission, edge computing, and real-time data analysis. Additionally,
    the paper does not provide insights into the specific methods used for data collection
    and transmission, which could limit the replicability and generalizability of
    the proposed solution.

    \ farming is labour-intensive, and the need to constantly check crops may be a\
    \ strain on \nfarmers. On another side, agricultural yield space is shrinking\
    \ by the day. So, without a question, \nmanaging a huge amount of food that is\
    \ legally right for us is a very difficult problem for any human \nbeing. There\
    \ may always be a footprint available to meet the high demand. By achieving the\
    \ idea of smart \nfarming based on new technology by using the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), the authors have presented a \nstrategy in this study work by which a\
    \ farmer may manage water irrigation, detect the total amount of \nbrightness,\
    \ and monitor the moisture level of soil and current status of crops using IoT.\
    \ By utilizing such \na technology, the farmer would obtain an auto lighting system,\
    \ an auto water irrigation system, prohibit \nexternal vehicles, and conserve\
    \ electricity by utilizing real-time data obtained from various types of \nsensors\
    \ and utilizing a Wi-Fi system. The suggested system's hardware is all directly\
    \ linked to the \nNodeMCU ESP8266. An algorithm has been created to manage the\
    \ entire project. The solar panel will \nsupply the entire system's necessary\
    \ electric power, allowing us to save money, conserve electricity, and \nmake\
    \ the total system more environmentally friendly. This work’s suggested system\
    \ can identify \nmeteorological conditions that are beneficial to agriculture.\
    \ This proposed concept has exceptional \nperformance potential as an interface\
    \ between sensors as input and the IoT as an output medium. The \nsuggested system\
    \ is compared to other existing systems in a variety of ways. \n \n \nKeywords:\

    \ de-\nvices is growing at an exponential rate, emphasizing \nthe significance\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT \nconnectivity is following the 3A (Anytime,\
    \ Any-one, \nAnything) paradigm. Tech Smart Homes & Cities, \nIoT Retail Shops,\
    \ Farming, Smart Grids, Smart Sup-\nply-chain Management, and other industries\
    \ are \nincorporating IoT. Agriculture is one of the most \nprominent sectors\
    \ in today's world. Farming and its \nassociated employment play an important\
    \ role in a \nnation's economic and commercial growth. Accor-\nding to FAO statistics,\
    \ agriculture employs 60 \npercent of the world's population, with the major \n\
    number of those employed coming from South and \nSouth-East Asia. \n \nAccording\
    \ to IoT Total Available Market (TAM) \nprojections, the number of IoT-connected\
    \ devices in \nthe world can increase from 7.6 billion to 24.1 bill-\nion, with\
    \ revenue increasing from USD 465 billion \nto more than USD 1.5 trillion. There\
    \ is a rapid transi-\ntion from traditional agriculture to farm management \n\
    controlled by completely different IoT companies. \nThe adoption of advanced IoT\
    \ technologies assists \ngrowers in producing higher yields from farms in \nresponse\
    \ to rising demand. According to new Meti-\nculous research, the smart agriculture\
    \ of IoT market \nwill grow at an Annual Rate of Growth (CAGR) of \nAustralian\

    friendly, and the farmer can reliably produce more \nfoods while also saving energy\
    \ costs. The following \nare the main contributions of this research work \n \n\
    1) The solar panel to provide power to the entire \nsystem has been introduced\
    \ in this work, the \nentire system is both cost effective and environ \nmentally\
    \ friendly. As a result, the cost is signi-\nficantly reduced. \n2) An Automatic\
    \ Lighting System has been attac-\nhed in this work. As we all know, many plants\
    \ \nrequire over 12 hours of lighting.  \n3) Various sensors, like the DHT22 (Dihydro-tes-\n\
    tosterone 22) sensor for measuring temp. and \ncounting humidity, the Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensor \nfor measuring soil moisture, the Raindrop \nSensor for detecting rain,\
    \ the PIR (Passive in-\nfrared) Motion Sensor for detecting external \nobjects\
    \ in the field, and the Water Pump for \nirrigation. \n \nLiterature Review \n\
    The authors proposed a Smart AgroTech model in \nPodder et al. (2021). They considered\
    \ humidity mea-\nsurement sensor, temperature measurement sensor, \nand soil-moisture\
    \ measurement sensor in this model. \nThey categorize their components into five\
    \ distinct \nsections: technology, controller, sensor, relay module, \nand water\
    \ pump. They used a switch plat-form called \nRelay Module in the modern AgroTech\
    \ model. They \nused an electric water pump motor in the final \nsection. The\
    \ relay module ensures that the conditions \nfor turning ON/OFF the pump motor\
    \ are met. Podder \net al. (2021) considered a moisture level of 55 per-\ncent\
    \ to measure moisture in the soil, and the control \nis dependent on a moisture\
    \ level below or above 55 \npercent. In this model, they use the ESP8266 as a\
    \ \ncontroller for the systems and sensors. To quantify \ntheir model, they attempted\
    \ to determine the error \nrate between genuine and noticed inform-ation in a\
    \ \nvariety of situations.Some underground and above-\nground sensors are included\
    \ in Almalki et al. (2021). \nData that comes from the sensors is collected every\
    \ 1 \nhour and then sent to the cloud, where it is analyzed \nevery 12 hours.\
    \ The authors of Almalki et al. (2021) \nattempted to implement a low-cost platform\
    \ using \nsensors and a flying drone, all of which are linked \nvia cloud computing\
    \ technology. The segments are \nreferred to as space segment and ground segment.\

    \ such as temperature, dampness, and \nmugginess, were detected using unique sensors\
    \ and \nthe Arduino UNO. Their demonstration worked well \nin a small field, but\
    \ in a larger field, it might run into \ntrouble. IoT-based automated greenhouse\
    \ farm-ing \nconcentrated in Tripathy et al. (2021). In that paper, \nthe authors\
    \ used numerous sensors like as tem-\nperature, humidity, UV light, pH measurement,\
    \ CO2 \nlevel, EC value, and insecticide or pesticide mea-\nsurement, and they\
    \ provide a system called Deci-\nsion-Support System in short (DSS) that controls\
    \ all \nsystem activity. The main goal of this paper is \nprimarily on rose cultivation.\
    \ In a data acquisition \nsystem, there are many types of different sensors and\
    \ \na machine learning classifier called Support Vector \nMachin (SVM) for specimens\
    \ to pre-vent diseases. \nIn the actuator management system, there is a \nCentral\
    \ Actuator manager who receives all DSS \ninstructions and controls all actuators.\
    \ Accor-ding to \nthe DSS, there is an interface for the end-user to \nview and\
    \ control everything, and the user can receive \nan in-app notification or SMS\
    \ for any type of \ninteraction. In their case study, they attempted to \ndemonstrate\
    \ the distinction between the trivial app-\nroach and their proposed \"MyGreen\"\
    \ approach.  \n \nAtmaja et al. (2021), describe the communication \nsystem between\
    \ the sensor and the database. All of \nthe sensors' data will be sent to the\
    \ database, and \nthey will use the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to \ndo so.\
    \ As a microcontroller, they proposed the Rasp-\nberry Pi. They used soil pH sensors\
    \ and moisture \nsensors in their proposed model. Water pumps and \nsluice gates\
    \ were also used, and everything can be \ncontrolled via web and mobile apps.\
    \ The collected \ndata from the sensors will be processed by Arduino \nand sent\
    \ to the server via ESP8266 in their research \nmethod. To evaluate Raspberry\
    \ Pi, they tried it at \nvarious distances with and without a barrier to \ndetermining\
    \ whether it succeeded or failed. Izzuddin \net al. (2021) concentrated on urban\
    \ farming methods \nin Indonesia. The population rate of other cities \naround\
    \ the world is increasing daily, just as it is in \ndeveloped countries. However,\
    \ land area is shrink-\ning. As the result, the urban farming technique is \n\
    critical for meeting the food needs of a huge number \nof people. In that paper,\
    \ they used Arduino UNO as \na microcontroller, and the whole system also in-\n\
    cludes many sensors like a humanity sensor, a tem-\nperature sensor, a soil moisture\
    \ sensor, and so on. \nAll types of sensors are wired directly to the micro-\n\
    controller, which is linked to a single-board com-\nputer (SBC). The sensor then\
    \ collected a huge \namount of data and converted it into an electric \nsignal,\
    \ transforming it into a digital data unit. Solar \npower was used as an alternative\
    \ source of electricity \nthroughout the entire system. Collected data directly\
    \ \nsent to the web server and SQL server, where it is \nreserved. The web part\
    \ displays and reserves all of \nthe collected data. The area may be irrigated\
    \ based \non sensor data. Sensors collect data on their own and \nsend it to the\
    \ Raspberry Pi. The data will be pro-\ncessed and fed into the two main components\
    \ of the \nRaspberry Pi. The primary goal of Ariffin et al. \n(2020) is to cultivate\
    \ mushrooms using modern agri-\nculture method that is linked to the IoT. Other\
    \ \nfarmers may be able to produce various types of \nseasonal vegetables or crops\
    \ by utilizing their smart \nprocess, thereby increasing the efficiency and \n\
    productivity of their farm. Optimal temperature and \nperfect humidity are required\
    \ for mushroom cultivat-\nion. A pump is installed in the house to control the\
    \ \ntemperature and adjust the humidity levels inside.  \n \nThe climate control\
    \ system is automatically included \nin the IoT control box. The water pump, which\
    \ in-\ncludes an exhaust fan, is powered by electricity. It \nmust have sensors\
    \ like as humidity, water level, and \ntemperature sensors that are linked to\
    \ an internet \ngateway via a wireless fidelity network system. This \ngateway\
    \ is resistant to ISP connections such as \nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line\
    \ (ADSL) or \nLong-Term Evolution (LTE). They can expertly \nutilize the MCU ESP8266\
    \ as a microcontroller to \nregulate the climatic system.The writers of Yaseen\
    \ et \nal. (2020) addressed certain agricultural criteria like \nWater Administration,\
    \ Climate Data, and Sun-powe-\nred Vitality. A temperature sensor, mugginess sen-\n\
    sor, dampness sensor, a Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 \nmodule), and other electrical\
    \ devices were included \nin their projected keen green development. When the\
    \ \nsensor's degree falls inside the physical boundaries \nof the surrounding\
    \ environment, the analog flag is \nchanged to a computerized flag. In Sarma et\
    \ al. \n(2020), the NodeMCU received moisture, rate of \nhumidity, and level of\
    \ temperature readings from \nArduino through a serial connection, as well as\
    \ LDR \nvalues from sensors, and then transferred the data to \nFirebase (a Google\

    \ with a water management sys-tem \nand storing a certain amount of water so that\
    \ the \nfarmer can use and reuse it as needed. The entire \nprocess is fully integrated\
    \ with smart IoT. This kit \nincludes soil, coriander seeds, and a plastic tray.\
    \ Soil \nis well mixed and strewn into the pan. Water is being \nsaved at the\
    \ farm's base. When water is required, the \nplants absorb it, and the excess\
    \ water drains into the \nfarm's foundation. In this farm, a moisture sensor \n\
    collects data and determines how much water is \nrequired in the farm air. Water\
    \ supplied to the farm \ndepends on the sensor measurement, which is \nreferred\
    \ to as a Predefined Threshold Value (PTV). \nThe Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)\
    \ is utilized for live \nmonitoring of the farm's present state. Santos et al.\
    \ \n(2019) introduces a novel agricultural method. This \nresearch taught us how\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network \ntechnologies and mobile computing platforms might\
    \ \nassist farmers to increase their output. Santos et al. \n(2019) also mentioned\
    \ how future planning and time \nliness aid in improved productivity, allowing\
    \ a \nfarmer to take the appropriate actions. The end phase \nof this paper's\
    \ prototype model is the proposed agri-\ncultural production method. This model\
    \ can forecast \nthe present temperature, soil, human population, and \nair pressure.\
    \ This might mean that the entire modern \nagricultural model is built on a low-power\
    \ WAN \nmethod and an agriculture pre-diction server. Data is \ntransported from\
    \ the low-power WAN to the Long-\nRange Radio (LoRa) Low-power Wide-Area Network\
    \ \n(LPWAN) during this operation. To avoid any form \nof anomaly, the methodology\
    \ additionally included a \n24x7 alarm system and a sort messaging mechanism.\
    \  \n \nA new method to modern agriculture method using \nIoT and Extreme Learning\
    \ Machines (ELM) has \nbeen pro-posed by Kale et al. (2019). This research \n\
    explored plant disease (PD) and nutrient deficiency \n(ND) prevention, as well\
    \ as food preference. Some \nsensors capture the essential data, which is then\
    \ used \nto determine the amount of fertilizer to be applied. \nBecause unbalanced\
    \ fertilizer reduces production \nvalue and is far more effective for human and\
    \ animal \nhealth. The initial step is to capture some photo-\ngraphs using any\
    \ type of digital camera. The humi-\ndity and temperature sensors are then used\
    \ to gather \ndata, which is then immediately linked to the Ardu-\nino. Collected\
    \ data is stored in a database. The data \nwas then begun to be evaluated. The\
    \ approach was \nmodified to work with a high-dimensional biological \ndataset.\
    \ \n \nMETHOLODOGY: \nThe developed system is divided into two sections: \nSection\
    \ 1 (Automated Sensor-Based Smart Farming) \nand Section 2. (Automated LDR-based\
    \ Lighting Sys-\ntem). The suggested system's heart is surrounded by \nthe main\
    \ hardware known as Node MCU ESP-8266. \nNodeMCU is ideal for developing open-source\
    \ hard-\nware projects like this work. This hardware is mostly \nutilized for\
    \ circuit board effectiveness and is linked \nwith a USB cable controller and\
    \ a tiny set-up board \ncontaining the MCU. The DIP (Dual In-line Pack-\nage)\
    \ configuration allows for clean prototyping on \nbreadboards. The Node MCU is\
    \ directly program-\nmed with a one-of-a-kind program that implements \nthe system.\
    \ All sensors are directly linked to the \nNodeMCU. Fig. 2 represents the block\
    \ diagram. \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Block Diagram of proposed system. \n \nSection 1\
    \ (Automated Sensor-Based Smart Farming) \ncollects and combines data from all\

    \ When NodeMCU evaluates the rate \nfrom the Temperature sensor and finds it to\
    \ be more \nthan or equal to 35-degree calculus, the motor is on; \notherwise,\
    \ the motor is turned OFF. When the rain \nsensor senses rain, the motor pump\
    \ turns OFF. \nAdditionally, it notifies the program user that \"Rain \nDetected.\"\
    \ When NodeMCU analyses the PIR Mo-\ntion sensor data and finds an external object\
    \ in the \nregion, it notifies the application with the message \n\"External object\
    \ identified.\" Wi-Fi is used to operate \nthe total system by a user of a mobile\
    \ application. \nFurthermore, this suggested system's principal energy \nsource\
    \ is the Solar Power system. In Section 2 \n(Automated LDR-based Lighting System),\

    \ and depths, whereas movable soil \nmoisture probes assess soil moisture at several\
    \ sites. \nWhen a crop begins to experience stress, it is critical \nto understand\
    \ the condition of the soil water content \nfor irrigation scheduling. Most crops\
    \ begin to expe-\nrience stress when soil water depletion/deficiency \nreach 30-50\

    sensor decreases. According to Algorithm 1, the \nNodeMCU immediately monitors\
    \ this data and sends \na short SMS to the user through Wi-Fi. When the \nuser\

    Plants require light sources for energy and life. Pho-\ntotropism occurs when\

    \ plant to \nface the light. Section 2 of the proposed system is \ndivided into\
    \ many components, which are described \nbelow. As a standard guide, most plants\
    \ need illu-\nmination for 10 to 14 hours every day. However, \nnumerous factors\
    \ impact how much light is required \nbecause the sun does not give the same quantity\
    \ of \nbrightness throughout the year. As a result, mana-\nging the lighting for\
    \ an intelligent IoT-based intel-\nligent farming system comprises an important\
    \ regu-\nlation for the entire system. It is always noticed that \ndarkness is\
    \ also required for plant photosynthesis. \nTable 1 shows how the light varies\

    nology known as the IoT Technology into this \nsuggested system, with several\
    \ fundamental ele-\nments of modern farming (IoT). This research work \nhas developed\
    \ some new methods while avoiding the \ninfluence of animals and other exterior\
    \ objects on \ntheir farms. A farmer executes this technology to \nmonitor rain\
    \ conditions by employing a rain detect-\nion sensor. The authors are also concerned\
    \ with \ncertain key concerns such as preventing future food \ncrises, watering\
    \ the land, improving the plant's \ngrowth value, reducing manpower, employing\
    \ new \nways of soil mixing, auto-regulating by mobile app, \nconserving electricity,\
    \ and providing 24-hour illumin \nation. The proposed system's major goal is to\
    \ make \nfarming more intelligent, eco-friendly, and user-\nfriendly in a systematic\
    \ manner. The authors hope \nthat, shortly, this suggested approach will follow\
    \ the \nway for all other individuals throughout the world to \nmake agricultural\
    \ practices more accessible and \nefficient. \n \nACKNOWLEGDEMENT: \nThis work\

    Abstract—On one hand, the emergence of cutting-edge tech-

    nologies like AI, Cloud Computing, and IoT holds immense

    potential in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. These

    technologies enable real-time data collection, including high-

    resolution crop imagery, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

    Leveraging these advancements can revolutionize agriculture by

    facilitating faster decision-making, cost reduction, and increased

    yields. Such progress aligns with precision agriculture principles,

    optimizing practices for the right locations, times, and quantities.

    On the other hand, integrating UAVs in Smart Farming faces

    obstacles related to technology selection and deployment, par-

    ticularly in data acquisition and image processing. The relative

    novelty of UAV utilization in Precision Agriculture contributes to

    the lack of standardized workflows. Consequently, the widespread

    adoption and implementation of UAV technologies in farming

    practices are hindered. This paper addresses these challenges by

    conducting a comprehensive review of recent UAV applications

    in Precision Agriculture. It explores common applications, UAV

    types, data acquisition techniques, and image processing methods

    to provide a clear understanding of each technology’s advantages

    and limitations. By gaining insights into the advantages and

    challenges associated with UAV-based applications in Precision

    Agriculture, this study aims to contribute to the development

    of standardized workflows and improve the adoption of UAV

    technologies.

    INTRODUCTION

    The agriculture industry is currently undergoing a sig-

    nificant transformation fueled by cutting-edge technologies,

    offering promising prospects for enhanced farm productivity

    and profitability. Precision Agriculture, which focuses on the

    precise application of inputs where and when they are needed,

    represents the third stage of the modern agricultural revolution.

    Advanced farm knowledge systems, empowered by the abun-

    dance of data, have further propelled the evolution of Preci-

    sion Agriculture [1]. Numerous studies have demonstrated the

    positive impacts of adopting Precision Agriculture technolo-

    gies, such as increased net returns and operating profits, as

    reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2].

    Moreover, there is a growing emphasis on implementing these

    technologies in environmentally conscious ways to ensure

    sustainable farm production. However, effectively harnessing

    the vast amount of data generated by crops remains a persistent

    challenge [3].

    To address these challenges, it is crucial to explore and

    integrate cutting-edge technologies in the realm of Smart

    Farming and Precision Agriculture. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

    (UAVs), Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data

    analytics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as key

    enablers of innovation in this domain [4]. UAVs equipped with

    advanced sensors and imaging capabilities allow for real-time

    data collection, including high-resolution imagery of crops.

    Cloud Computing provides the infrastructure for data storage,

    processing, and analysis, while IoT facilitates the seamless

    integration of various agricultural devices and sensors. Big

    Data analytics and AI techniques enable intelligent insights

    and decision-making based on the collected data [5], [6].

    This paper aims to delve into the theoretical background

    and related work of UAV, Cloud, IoT, Big Data, and AI

    approaches in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. Ad-

    ditionally, authors propose a comprehensive systematic review

    study that investigates the current state of research and de-

    velopment in this area. By analyzing existing literature, in

    order to identify the gaps, challenges, and opportunities for

    utilizing these technologies in the context of Smart Farming

    and Precision Agriculture, Fig. 1, depicted below, offers valu-

    able insights into the evolution characteristics and challenges

    of agricultural development, spanning from Farming 1.0 to

    Farming 5.0. This figure serves as a valuable tool to showcase

    the effective utilization and evolution of technologies within

    the realms of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture. The

    problem statement of this study revolves around the lack

    of a standardized framework for leveraging UAVs, Cloud

    Computing, IoT, Big Data, and AI in Smart Farming and

    Precision Agriculture. This lack of standardization hinders the

    widespread adoption and implementation of these technolo-

    gies, limiting their potential benefits for farmers, agricultural

    productivity, and sustainable practices. To address this prob-

    lem, our proposed solution is to conduct a systematic review

    that synthesizes existing research, identifies key insights, and

    provides recommendations for the development of standard-

    ized frameworks and practices in this field.

    The motivation behind this work stems from the immense

    potential of integrating UAVs, Cloud Computing, IoT, Big Data

    analytics, and AI in Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    By leveraging these technologies effectively, farmers can make

    faster and more informed decisions, reduce costs, optimize

    resource utilization, and increase yields. Moreover, this inte-

    gration aligns with the growing demand for sustainable farming

    practices and the need to meet the rising global food demands.

    The contribution of this paper lies in the comprehensive review

    of existing literature, which consolidates knowledge, identifies

    research gaps, and proposes recommendations for the future

    development of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture.

    BACKGROUND

    A. Unnamed Aerial Vehicles for Agriculture

    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), also known as drones,

    have become increasingly popular in agriculture due to their

    ability to provide a quick, cost-effective and efficient way to

    gather data and perform tasks on large fields and crops [7].

    UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) indeed come in different

    types and can be equipped with a variety of sensors and

    cameras presented in Fig. 2 that can capture high-resolution

    images, aerial maps and thermal imagery, which can be used

    for a range of agriculture applications, including:

    •

    Crop monitoring: UAS can be used to gather real-time

    data on crop health, growth, and yield potential.

    •

    Irrigation management: Drones can be equipped with

    infrared cameras to identify areas that are in need of

    irrigation and to help optimize water use.

    •

    Pest and disease management: Drones can be used

    to detect and map the spread of pests and diseases in

    crops, helping farmers to take timely action to prevent

    or treat these issues.

    •

    Field mapping: UAS can produce high-resolution

    maps of fields, providing data on soil structure, to-

    pography, and plant populations, which can be used to

    make informed decisions about planting, fertilization

    and other aspects of crop management.

    •

    Livestock management: Drones can be used to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock, as well as to keep

    track of the location of animals.

    Overall, the use of UAS in agriculture provides a new tool for

    farmers to gather data, monitor their crops and make more

    informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved yields,

    increased efficiency and reduced costs.

    B. Cloud, Internet of Things, Big data and IA

    1) Cloud: computing plays a crucial role in smart farming,

    which is an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in

    agriculture. The cloud enables farmers to store, process, and

    analyze large amounts of data generated from various IoT

    devices and sensors on their farms [9]. This data can include

    information on weather patterns, soil moisture levels, crop

    growth, and even the health of livestock. By analyzing this data

    in real-time, farmers can make more informed decisions about

    crop management and animal husbandry, leading to increased

    productivity and efficiency.

    Additionally, cloud-based solutions can provide farmers

    with access to advanced algorithms and predictive analytics

    tools that can help them optimize their farming operations.

    For example, cloud-based machine learning models can predict

    UAV, Sensing UAV) [8].

    crop yields, identify pest infestations, and suggest the most

    appropriate treatments. Furthermore, the cloud allows farmers

    to monitor their farms remotely and receive real-time updates

    on conditions and activities.

    2) Internet of Things: The concept of the Internet of Things

    (IoT) pertains to a network comprising physical devices,

    vehicles, appliances, and various objects. These entities are

    equipped with sensors, software, and connectivity features that

    empower them to gather and exchange data via the internet.

    These connected devices can communicate and interact with

    each other, as well as with humans, creating a vast ecosystem

    of interconnected systems [10]. The IoT has the potential to

    revolutionize various sectors, including agriculture, healthcare,

    transportation, smart homes, and many others, by enabling

    increased automation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-

    making. In smart farming, IoT is used to gather real-time data

    from various sources such as weather stations, soil moisture

    sensors, and crop and animal monitoring systems.

    IoT devices and sensors in smart farming can range from

    simple weather sensors to more complex systems such as pre-

    cision agriculture systems that use Global Positioning System

    (GPS) to monitor the growth and health of crops. These devices

    can also be connected to irrigation systems, allowing farmers

    to control the amount of water they use based on real-time

    soil moisture levels. One of the key benefits of IoT in smart

    farming is that it enables farmers to make data-driven decisions

    in real-time. This leads to more efficient use of resources and

    improved crop yields. IoT also enables farmers to monitor their

    farms remotely, reducing the need for on-site visits and freeing

    up more time for other tasks.

    In addition to its direct benefits, IoT in smart farming

    can also help address important global challenges such as

    food security and sustainability [11]. By using technology to

    optimize their operations, farmers can produce more food using

    fewer resources, reducing their carbon footprint and helping to

    ensure that future generations have access to safe and healthy

    food. Overall, the Internet of Things is revolutionizing the way

    farming is done and is poised to play a crucial role in the future

    of agriculture.

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are networks of small,

    low-cost, and low-power devices that can be used to monitor

    and collect data from the environment [12]. These devices,

    called “nodes”, are equipped with sensors, microcontrollers,

    and wireless communication capabilities, allowing them to

    transmit data wirelessly to a central location for analysis.

    WSNs are widely used in a variety of applications, in-

    cluding smart farming, where they are used to monitor soil

    moisture, temperature, light, and other environmental param-

    eters that affect crop growth [13]. The data collected by the

    sensor nodes can be used to make informed decisions about

    irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices, leading

    to increased efficiency and higher crop yields.

    One of the key benefits of WSNs is that they are low-cost

    and easy to deploy, making them accessible to farmers of all

    sizes and resources. They are also scalable, allowing farmers

    to add more nodes as their needs grow [14]. Finally, a review

    of 77 research papers published between 2012 and 2022 on

    the implementation of IoT in various agricultural applications

    showed that roughly 16% focused on precision agriculture

    and the same percentage on irrigation monitoring. 13% of

    the papers delved into soil monitoring, while temperature and

    animal monitoring were each covered in 11% of the research.

    Air and disease monitoring each received 5% of attention, with

    water monitoring accounting for 7%. Fertilization monitoring

    was the least studied, with only 4% of the research papers

    devoted to it in [15].

    C. Big Data

    Big Data plays a significant role in the context of smart

    farming. Smart farming involves the application of advanced

    technologies, such as sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) de-

    vices, and data analytics, to enhance agricultural practices and

    decision-making processes [16]. These technologies generate

    vast amounts of data from various sources, including weather

    conditions, soil moisture levels, crop health indicators, and

    machinery performance.

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org

    1152 | P a g e

    IJACSA-International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,

    Vol. 14, No. 6, 2023

    Big Data analytics allows for the collection, storage, pro-

    cessing, and analysis of large volumes of agricultural data in

    real-time or near-real-time. By applying advanced analytics

    techniques, such as machine learning and predictive model-

    ing, valuable insights can be extracted from this data. These

    insights can help optimize farming practices, improve resource

    allocation, enhance crop yield, and enable more informed

    decision-making for farmers and agricultural stakeholders [17].

    Furthermore, Big Data analytics can enable predictive capa-

    bilities in smart farming. By leveraging historical data and

    machine learning algorithms, models can be developed to

    forecast disease outbreaks, pests infestation, crop yield, and

    market demand. These predictive insights empower farmers to

    make proactive decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize resource

    allocation. In summary, the integration of Big Data analyt-

    ics in smart farming allows for data-driven decision-making,

    optimization of agricultural practices, and the potential for

    increased productivity, sustainability, and profitability in the

    agriculture industry [18], [19].

    D. Artificial Intelligence

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses the creation of

    computer systems capable of executing tasks typically requir-

    ing human intelligence, including pattern recognition, predic-

    tion, and learning from experience. In smart farming, AI is

    used to automate various processes and make more informed

    decisions [16]. One of the key applications of AI in smart

    farming is precision agriculture, where AI algorithms are used

    to analyze data from various sources, such as weather stations

    and sensors, to determine the best practices for growing crops.

    For example, AI can be used to optimize irrigation and fer-

    tilization practices, leading to increased efficiency and higher

    yields. AI can also be used in animal husbandry to monitor

    the health and behavior of livestock. Also, AI algorithms can

    be used to detect signs of illness in animals, such as changes

    in their heart rate or behavior, and alert farmers to take action.

    Another application of AI in smart farming is in the detection

    and control of pests and diseases. AI algorithms can be used to

    analyze images of crops and detect signs of pests or diseases,

    allowing farmers to take proactive measures to address them. In

    conclusion, AI is a valuable tool in the development of smart

    farming, enabling farmers to make more informed decisions

    and automate various processes [20]. By using AI, farmers can

    improve efficiency, increase yields, and reduce waste, making

    a valuable contribution to the future of agriculture. However,

    it’s important to note that while AI has the potential to greatly

    benefit the agriculture industry; it also presents challenges,

    such as the need for large amounts of data and the potential

    for bias in algorithms. Thus, it’s important to approach the

    integration of AI in smart farming with caution and a focus

    on ethical and sustainable practices.

    METHODOLOGY

    In recent years, the academic community has extensively

    analyzed numerous works related to smart farming develop-

    ment from various perspectives. For instance, [21] introduced a

    systematic review focusing on precision farming. Then, authors

    in [22] provided a review on technologies in precision agricul-

    ture, highlighting innovations, technologies, and applications.

    Also, authors in [23] explored the use of big data on smart

    farming, emphasizing the primary opportunities and challenges

    associated with this technology. Additionally, [24] conducted a

    quantitative literature review, offering an overview of academic

    production in smart farming.

    In order to enhance the existing analyses, the present

    study seeks to conduct a comprehensive review of UAV based

    applications in the field of smart farming. To accomplish this

    objective, we employed the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology [25], a frame-

    work specifically designed to facilitate literature reports and

    systematic reviews. In October 2022, authors conducted a

    search using the available search tool on the Scopus database

    website. Additionally, another search was performed in april

    2023 within the same database to include papers published

    in the year 2023. Scopus was selected due to its exten-

    sive coverage and relevance in similar bibliographic reviews

    mentioned in [24] and [26]. Our search strategy focused

    on terms related to technological applications in agriculture,

    such as “Precision Agriculture,” “Precision Farming,” “Smart

    Farming,” and “Smart Agriculture,” in conjunction with “UAV”

    and related terms. The publication date of articles was not a

    basis for exclusion. However, we restricted our research scope

    to journal and conference articles published in English. To

    ensure methodological rigor, this systematic review adhered to

    the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for

    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), with the

    most recent version being 2020. In Table I, you will find a

    compilation of the research questions (RQ) that the Systematic

    Literature Review (SLR) aims to address.

    In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) was

    conducted to assess recent research papers on the use of IoT,

    Big data, Cloud & AI techniques in the field of Smart farm-

    ing. However, advancements in technology and the increasing

    availability of digital resources have led to the development of

    new systematic review process, but the traditional systematic

    literature review methodology remains the standard approach

    for conducting systematic reviews, new tools and techniques

    are emerging that can enhance the process and provide addi-

    tional benefits to researchers and decision-makers. However,

    it is important to consider the limitations of these new ap-

    proaches and to ensure that the results of the systematic review

    remain reliable and trustworthy. The following are the steps

    involved in the systematic literature review methodology: In

    this context, lookup has produced a plethora of SLR standards

    that should be observed to reap tremendous empirical research.

    In this paper, we concentrate on the SLR guidelines proposed

    by authors in [19], which can be classified into the following

    categories. There are four steps:

    •

    Step 1: Identifying the research goal(s).

    •

    Step 2: Research subject framing (conceptual bound-

    aries).

    •

    Step 3: Using inclusion/exclusion criteria to collect

    data.

    •

    Step 4: Validation of the research findings is the fourth

    step.

    A. Research Objectives

    This study attempts to systematically analyze possible

    future possibilities for IoT, Cloud, Big Data and AI in Smart

    Farming by analyzing current knowledge and the state of the

    research, with a focus on recent research advancements. This

    paper is interested in learning how this study topic has changed

    throughout time. Furthermore, the outcomes of the evaluation

    will be utilized to identify critical activities for future study as

    well as practical applications.

    B. Framing of the Research Subject

    The goal of this study is to evaluate Big Data, Cloud,

    internet of things, artificial intelligence technologies for Smart

    Farming in a systematic way. As a result, the research subject,

    i.e. the conceptual boundaries, were defined in the agriculture

    environment using the terms “Unnamed Aerial Vehicle”, “Big

    Data”, “Cloud”, “internet of things”, “artificial intelligence”

    and related concepts “machine learning” and “deep learning.”

    The following Table II displays the Inclusion and exclusion

    criteria identified to refine the search request.

    C. Data Collection by Using Criteria

    A definition of search parameters, databases, search key-

    words, and publication time is also required by the SLR.

    The selection of search resources and the choice of search

    phrases are both part of the search strategy. To find the papers,

    automated search engine from the most relevant sources were

    chosen: Scopus. A further examination of similar databases

    (ACM Digital Library and Emerald) revealed significant vari-

    ations in the research studies that resulted. As a result, Scopus

    was used as the primary database for secondary data evaluation

    in this research study. The systematic research approach [24]

    and the inclusion and exclusion criterias, which are based on

    the process query depicted in Fig. 3.

    Screening the article title, abstract, and keywords for rele-

    vant literature for Blockchain, IoT and AI in the subject areas

    of management was the first step. We included a variety of

    document formats in this stage and limited them to the English

    language. This first method was mostly utilized to obtain a

    sense of where research was at the time. As a result, the study

    was not limited intialy to a specific period. In total, 536 studies

    were found as a result of this method. We concentrated on

    studies in the areas of Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture

    in the second step. As a consequence, we narrowed down

    the previously identified 536 publications to 186 papers that

    contained the terms Smart Farming or Precision Agriculture.

    Furthermore, we created a ranking of all detected keywords,

    which was utilized to verify the meta-search query for the

    current database investigation. In our research strategy, no

    important terms were left out. To evaluate only high-quality

    studies, the study was limited to conference papers, conference

    reviews, articles, or reviews in the third step. In conclusion,

    the final meta-search query was as follows:

    Research Query : (“UAV” OR “Unnamed Aerial Vehicle”)

    AND (“Machine Learning” OR “Deep Learning”) AND (“IoT

    technology” OR “IoT” OR “Internet of Things” OR “internet-

    of-things”) AND (“Smart Farming” OR “Smart Agriculture”

    OR “Precision Farming” OR “Precision Agriculture”) AND

    (“Cloud Computing”).

    The chosen papers were evaluated using eight quality

    assessment questions listed in Table III [27]. Scores of 1 (high

    quality), 0.5 (moderate quality), or 0 (poor quality) were given

    to each paper. Papers that received a total score below four

    were removed from the study.

    IV.

    RESULTS

    This section present the results obtained and content

    analysis on the complete texts of the identified papers. The

    initial stage of the selection process involved screening the

    title, abstract, and introduction of each paper to ascertain

    its relevance. The subsequent step was to eliminate papers

    that did not meet the exclusion criteria outlined in Table II.

    As a result, 80 papers were identified as the basis for the

    further research process. It is important to note that quotation

    marks are used to ensure that multi-word terms are searched

    together, preventing individual words from being considered

    separately. After conducting the search, the resulting articles

    were manually reviewed by analyzing their titles, keywords,

    abstracts, and texts. Duplicate articles were eliminated, and

    the remaining articles were assessed to determine whether

    they were relevant to the study’s objectives. Valid articles

    were those that focused on IoT-based solutions for agricultural

    problems, were not literature reviews, were written in English,

    Portuguese, or Spanish, and pertained to agriculture rather than

    livestock activities. The study’s search and selection process is

    summarized in Fig. 4. The initial search yielded 536 articles,

    which were then analyzed and narrowed down to 186 articles

    that met the study’s eligibility criteria. During the screening

    phase, 350 articles were deemed invalid and discarded based on

    their lack of relevance to the study’s objectives. Of these, 65%

    did not focus on smart farming. Additionally, almost 35% of

    the discarded papers were literature reviews or studies related

    to smart farming that did not involve IoT. A small number

    of papers pertained to smart farming but did not address IoT

    (about 5% were related to sensors), and some papers had

    abstracts or texts that were not available (about 2%).

    In the eligibility phase, the content of the 80 remaining

    articles was reviewed using the same criteria as in the screening

    phase. Of these, 23 articles were discarded, with 27% not

    related to IoT and 32% not to smart farming. The remain-

    ing 41% were literature reviews or papers without available

    content. This research analysis conducted in 57 articles that

    were eligible for inclusion in the study’s sample.

    A. Description Analysis

    57 papers were ultimately assigned to the topic and rated as

    relevant for deep analysis, out of a total of 536 papers that had

    been previously identified regarding the application of Cloud,

    Big Data, IoT, AI, within UAV Application in Smart Farming.

    The distribution of the selected studies’ suitability, which was

    assessed by reading their titles and abstracts, the distribution

    of articles published per year is shown in Fig. 5, then the

    distribution of documents per year per source is provided

    in Fig. 6 and finally the Fig. 7 describe the distribution of

    documents by appropriateness.

    The decrease in research on the application of drones in

    precision agriculture may be multiple and dependent on vari-

    ous factors such as funding, research priorities, technological

    advancements, etc. However, some possible hypotheses can

    be suggested: Recent technological advancements may have

    solved a significant portion of the issues related to drone

    application in precision agriculture, thereby reducing the need

    for further research in this field. Funding for research in this

    field may have been reduced or directed towards other research

    areas. The scientific community may be transitioning to other

    agricultural monitoring technologies or methods, such as the

    use of remote sensors or satellites. It is also possible that the

    number of scientific publications on the subject has decreased,

    but research is still ongoing in other contexts as provided in

    the distribution of document by subject area provided in Fig.

    8, such as in the private industry. Ultimately, it is important to

    realize that the decrease in research in a given field does not

    necessarily imply that research should be abandoned or that

    previous results are no longer relevant. Existing research can

    still be used to improve existing applications and guide future

    research.

    Out of the 166 full texts in the field of smart farming

    that were found, 96 papers (58%) were rated as having high

    appropriateness, 53 papers (32%) as having medium appropri-

    ateness, and 17 papers (10%) as having low appropriateness in

    relation to the goal of this research project. Book chapters are

    of total of 21%, while research articles are 44%, and reviews

    are 23%.

    Based on the 166 complete articles that were found, Fig.

    8 displays the distribution of document types in the field of

    smart farming by subject area.

    B. Content Analysis

    The complete texts of the papers were reviewed and iden-

    tified in this section. Table IV summarizes the most important

    clusters, primary references, to group the chosen literature into

    related clusters, we engaged in a thorough content analysis.

    In addition Table V complete this set of research documents

    by UAV articles analyzed by characteristics and limitations

    identified in the survey.

    IoT (Internet of Things) technology is transforming the

    agricultural industry by enabling farmers to collect and an-

    alyze data from various sources to make informed decisions.

    However, like any technology, IoT also presents challenges and

    issues, particularly in the context of smart farming. Table VI

    provides a comparison of IoT issues and challenges in smart

    farming:

    RQ1. WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF UAVS

    IN PRECISION AGRICULTURE?

    The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cloud technol-

    ogy in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has brought about

    significant improvements in smart farming. Here are some of

    the impacts:

    •

    Soil Analysis: UAVs can be used to collect soil

    samples, analyze soil moisture levels, and assess soil

    quality, which can help farmers optimize fertilization

    and irrigation practices.

    •

    Planting: UAVs can be used to plant seeds precisely

    and efficiently, reducing labor costs and increasing

    planting accuracy. Crop spraying: UAVs equipped

    with spraying systems can be used to apply pesticides,

    herbicides, and fertilizers accurately, reducing the en-

    SYSTEMS?

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are increasingly

    being used for crop monitoring and management in agriculture.

    Various types of crops can be monitored using UAV systems,

    including different Cereals. These crops are often monitored

    for growth stages, yield prediction, and disease detection [63].

    Fruits and vegetables: Such as grapes, citrus, apples, tomatoes,

    and potatoes. UAV systems can monitor the growth and health

    of these crops, detect pests and diseases, and assess yield.

    Oilseeds: Such as soybeans, sunflowers, and canola. UAV

    systems can be used to monitor crop growth, assess the health

    of plants, and predict yields. Specialty crops: Such as coffee,

    tea, cocoa, and tobacco. UAV systems can help monitor the

    health of these crops, detect early signs of disease or pest

    volutional neural network

    using unmanned aerial ve-

    hicle (UAV) imagery

    This paper proposes a framework

    that integrates UAVs with IoT and

    cloud computing for smart agricul-

    ture. The authors demonstrate the

    feasibility of the proposed frame-

    work through a case study. They

    conclude that the proposed frame-

    work can improve crop yield and

    reduce costs for farmers.

    The authors primarily focus on the

    challenges associated with imple-

    menting UAV-based systems, rather

    than discussing potential solutions

    or strategies for overcoming these

    challenges. While this is an im-

    portant aspect to consider, a more

    detailed analysis of potential solu-

    tions or strategies could be useful

    for practitioners and researchers in

    the field.

    infestations, and optimize harvest. While the use of UAV

    systems for crop monitoring has several advantages, there

    are also some limitations to the types of crops that can

    be effectively monitored. Here are some of the limitations

    collected by analyzing the following articles [64], [65], [66].

    So, there are several limitations to using UAVs for crop

    monitoring. Firstly, UAVs can only cover a limited area in

    a single flight, which makes it difficult to monitor large farms

    efficiently. Secondly, UAVs are affected by weather conditions

    and may not be able to fly in adverse weather, which can

    impact data collection. Thirdly, UAVs require skilled operators

    and specialized equipment, which can be costly and time-

    consuming to maintain. Then, regulations around the use of

    UAVs can be complex and vary between countries, which can

    add another layer of complexity to their use in crop monitoring.

    These limitations must be carefully considered when deciding

    whether to use UAVs for crop monitoring and when planning

    a UAV-based monitoring program.

    In conclusion, while UAV systems can be an effective tool

    for crop monitoring, there are limitations to the types of crops

    that can be effectively monitored. Crop height, density, size,

    weather conditions, and sensor limitations are all factors that

    can affect the effectiveness of UAV monitoring. Generally,

    UAV systems can provide farmers with valuable insights and

    data to optimize crop management, increase productivity, and

    reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers.

    RQ3. HOW CAN UAV-BASED TECHNOLOGIES BE

    ADAPTED FOR USE IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROPS OR

    FARMING ENVIRONMENTS?

    Precision agriculture involves the use of various tech-

    nologies to optimize crop management and increase yields.

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are becoming in-

    creasingly popular in precision agriculture due to their ability

    to collect high-resolution data quickly and efficiently. Here are

    some UAV system technologies in Fig. 10 that are commonly

    adopted in precision agriculture:

    •

    Multispectral imaging: UAVs equipped with multi-

    spectral cameras can capture images of crops at dif-

    ferent wavelengths, providing valuable information on

    plant health, stress levels, and nutrient deficiencies.

    •

    Thermal imaging: Thermal cameras mounted on UAVs

    can detect differences in temperature across a field,

    helping to identify areas of stress or water deficiency

    in crops.

    •

    Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging): UAVs equipped

    with Lidar technology can create high-resolution 3D

    maps of crops and terrain, which can be used for crop

    modeling and yield prediction.

    •

    Global Positioning System (GPS): UAVs equipped

    with GPS can precisely navigate and collect data on

    a field, helping farmers to monitor crop growth and

    identify problem areas.

    •

    Machine learning and artificial intelligence: UAV sys-

    tems can collect vast amounts of data that can be

    analyzed and processed using machine learning and

    artificial intelligence algorithms.

    •

    Variable rate application (VRA): UAV systems can be

    used for VRA, where the data collected can be used to

    tailor crop management practices to specific areas of a

    field, optimizing inputs like fertilizers and pesticides,

    reducing costs and environmental impact.

    Overall, these UAV system technologies can provide farm-

    ers with detailed information on crop health, growth, and yield

    potential, helping them to make more informed decisions on

    crop management and increase productivity.

    RQ4. WHAT TYPES OF DATA CAN BE OBTAINED

    THROUGH THE USE OF UAVS?

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are deployed in various appli-

    cations, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and

    infrastructure inspection. UAVs are equipped with sensors that

    can capture different types of data. Here are some examples

    of data that can be acquired by UAVs:

    •

    Visual imagery: UAVs can capture high-resolution

    visual imagery using cameras that range from standard

    RGB cameras to more specialized cameras like mul-

    tispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal cameras. These

    images can be used to monitor vegetation health,

    detect anomalies, and map land cover.

    •

    LiDAR: LiDAR sensors can be mounted on UAVs

    to generate high-resolution 3D maps of the terrain,

    vegetation, and structures. This data can be used

    for precise measurements of features such as height,

    volume, and biomass.

    •

    GPS data: UAVs can collect GPS data, which can

    be used to generate maps, track the drone’s position,

    and measure distances. Environmental data: UAVs

    can be equipped with sensors that measure environ-

    mental variables such as temperature, humidity, and

    air quality. This data can be used for environmental

    monitoring and disaster response.

    •

    Magnetic and acoustic data: UAVs can be equipped

    with magnetometers to measure the magnetic field

    of the Earth’s surface. This data can be used for

    geological surveys and mineral exploration. UAVs can

    also be equipped with microphones to capture acoustic

    data.

    Overall, UAVs can capture a wide range of data types,

    which can be used for various applications in fields such as

    agriculture, environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspec-

    tion, and disaster response.

    RQ5. WHICH METHODS OF DATA PROCESSING CAN BE

    EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE AGRICULTURAL DATA

    COLLECTED BY UAVS?

    The data acquired by UAVs in precision agriculture can

    be processed and analyzed using various techniques to extract

    useful information. Here are some examples of data processing

    methods that can be used to exploit agricultural data acquired

    by UAVs described in Fig. 11.

    •

    Image processing: UAVs capture high-resolution im-

    ages of crops, which can be processed using image

    processing techniques to extract information such as

    crop health, leaf area index, and crop growth stage.

    Vol. 14, No. 6, 2023

    Fig. 11. Data processing methods used to exploit data collected by UAV.

    •

    Geographic Information System (GIS): UAV data can

    be integrated with GIS to create maps that provide

    valuable information about crop health, yield, and soil

    properties.

    •

    3D modeling: UAVs can capture data in the form of

    point clouds using LIDAR sensors, which can be used

    to create 3D models of the field. These models can

    be used to estimate crop height, biomass, and plant

    spacing.

    In summary, the data acquired by UAVs in precision agri-

    culture can be processed and analyzed using various techniques

    to extract valuable information about crop health, yield, and

    soil properties. These techniques include image processing,

    GIS, multispectral data analysis, machine learning, and 3D

    modeling.

    RQ6. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

    USING DRONES FOR DISEASE DETECTION IN

    AGRICULTURE?

    The challenges can be categorized into two primary

    groups: dataset-related challenges and model-building chal-

    lenges. Dataset-related challenges encompass deformations in

    the image dataset, insufficient availability of expert-labeled

    data, significant randomness in the data, and inadequate repre-

    sentation of classes in the dataset. Challenges associated with

    model building are the scarcity of training samples, extended

    training and processing times. Out of the papers analyzed, only

    two proposed potential solutions for these difficulties. The use

    of UAV in smart farming has become increasingly popular

    due to their ability to collect vast amounts of data quickly

    and accurately. However, the integration of Internet of Things

    (IoT) technologies into UAV applications also brings unique

    challenges and issues. The Table VI provides a comparison

    of the key challenges and issues related to IoT in UAV

    applications for smart farming.

    RQ7. WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL

    IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF DRONES

    IN AGRICULTURE, AND HOW CAN THESE ISSUES BE

    ADDRESSED?

    The use of drones in agriculture presents various ethical

    and legal implications that need to be considered and ad-

    dressed. From an ethical standpoint, privacy concerns arise

    as drones can capture sensitive information about individuals

    or their properties. There is also the potential for drones to

    infringe on airspace regulations, endangering other aircraft

    or public safety. Furthermore, the automation and autonomy

    of drones raise questions about accountability and liability

    in case of accidents or damage caused by these devices. To

    address these issues, several measures can be implemented.

    Firstly, clear regulations and guidelines should be established

    regarding the operation of drones in agricultural settings. These

    regulations should address aspects such as flight restrictions,

    licensing requirements, and privacy protection. Adequate en-

    forcement mechanisms should be in place to ensure compli-

    ance.

    Secondly, public awareness campaigns and education ini-

    tiatives can inform both farmers and the general public about

    the responsible and legal use of drones in agriculture. This can

    help foster understanding and mitigate privacy concerns. Addi-

    tionally, technological solutions can be developed to enhance

    privacy protection, such as implementing geofencing mecha-

    nisms that restrict drone access to certain areas or utilizing

    data anonymization techniques. Collaboration between stake-

    holders, including farmers, drone operators, regulatory bodies,

    and legal experts, is crucial for developing comprehensive

    guidelines and frameworks that address the ethical and legal

    implications of drone use in agriculture. Regular review and

    updates of regulations can also ensure they remain relevant

    as technology evolves. Ultimately, a balanced approach is

    needed that considers the benefits of drone technology in

    agriculture while safeguarding privacy, public safety, and legal

    compliance.

    DISCUSSIONS

    The reason to conduct this systematic review on UAV-

    based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and cloud

    technologies is to provide a comprehensive overview of the

    current state-of-the-art in this field. This review aims to gather

    and analyze existing research studies, to identify gaps in the

    literature, and to provide insights into the potential of these

    technologies for smart farming.

    The systematic review will contribute to the research field

    in several ways. Firstly, it will provide a clear understanding

    of the current state-of-the-art in UAV-based applications in

    smart farming, including the various applications, benefits,

    and challenges associated with the use of these technologies.

    Secondly, it will identify gaps in the literature and areas where

    further research is needed. This will help researchers to focus

    their efforts on areas that are most promising and where further

    advancements are needed. Thirdly, it will provide insights into

    the potential of these technologies to transform the agriculture

    industry, promote sustainable farming practices, and address

    global food security challenges.

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies face several data challenges that must

    be addressed for successful implementation. These challenges

    include acquiring and efficiently storing the large amounts of

    data generated by UAVs, ensuring the quality and reliability

    of the data, processing and analyzing the data in real-time

    using AI and cloud technologies, seamlessly integrating the

    UAV-based applications with other systems, and ensuring

    data privacy and security. Overcoming these challenges will

    require the development of robust data management strategies,

    advanced algorithms for data analysis, secure and interoperable

    systems, and effective policies and regulations for data privacy

    and security. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for

    the successful implementation of UAV-based applications in

    smart farming and the realization of their potential benefits for

    the agricultural industry. Meteorological conditions can have a

    significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart farming

    that use AI, IoT, and cloud technologies. For example, wind

    speed and direction can affect the stability and maneuverability

    of the UAV, which can impact the quality of the data collected.

    Similarly, rain, fog, and low-light conditions can affect the

    quality of the images and sensor readings collected by the

    UAV, which can impact the accuracy of the data analysis.

    Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, thunder-

    storms, and blizzards can also pose safety risks for the UAV

    and the personnel operating it. High winds, lightning, and

    heavy precipitation can damage the UAV or cause it to crash,

    while snow and ice can affect its mobility and stability. To mit-

    igate the impact of meteorological conditions on UAV-based

    applications in smart farming, it is important to have reliable

    weather forecasting systems in place. This can help farmers

    and operators plan UAV flights around weather patterns, avoid-

    ing unsafe conditions and optimizing data collection.

    Additionally, it is important to use UAVs equipped with

    weather-resistant sensors and cameras that can operate in a

    range of environmental conditions. This can help ensure the

    accuracy and reliability of the data collected, even in adverse

    weather conditions. In summary, meteorological conditions can

    have a significant impact on UAV-based applications in smart

    farming, and it is important to have reliable weather forecasting

    systems and weather-resistant equipment to mitigate these

    effects.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today.

    By validating and comparing the PRISMA (Preferred Re-

    porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)

    results with the presented objectives, scenarios, and analysis

    criteria in Table VII, this systematic review aims to enhance the

    existing survey methodology. It strives to provide an updated

    research review based on established guidelines, which can

    have several advantages. So, by employing a validated method-

    ology and adhering to established guidelines like PRISMA, this

    work aims to provide a reliable, transparent, and up-to-date

    resource that can contribute to the existing body of knowledge

    in UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. Despite the numerous benefits associated

    with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT, and cloud technologies in smart

    farming, there are still some limitations and challenges that

    need to be addressed in the future. One of the main limitations

    is the high cost of acquiring and maintaining these technolo-

    gies, which may limit their adoption by smallholder farmers.

    Another limitation is the lack of regulatory frameworks and

    policies to guide their use, particularly in developing countries.

    Overall, this systematic review will be a valuable resource

    for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in

    UAV-based applications in smart farming using AI, IoT, and

    cloud technologies. It will help to identify areas where further

    research is needed, and provide insights into the potential

    of these technologies to address some of the most pressing

    challenges facing the agriculture industry today. Despite the

    numerous benefits associated with the use of UAVs, AI, IoT,

    and cloud technologies in smart farming, there are still some

    limitations and challenges that need to be addressed in the

    future.

  analysis: "The paper presents a smart irrigation system that uses sensor nodes with\
    \ soil moisture and temperature sensors to collect data from a field. The data\
    \ is sent to a gateway and then to a cloud platform for further analysis. Based\
    \ on the analysis, farmers can remotely monitor the field and operate the irrigation\
    \ system using a smartphone app. The system is claimed to save water and energy\
    \ consumption, reduce the number of farm workers needed, and increase crop production.\
    \ \n\nThe paper provides a good overview of the system and its components. Here's\
    \ how the paper specifically addresses the point within the larger context and\
    \ intent of the literature review: \n\n**Relevance**: The paper is highly relevant\
    \ to the point of different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature,\
    \ weather) and their collection and use. It discusses the use of soil moisture\
    \ and temperature sensors to collect data from the field. \n\n**Insight**: The\
    \ paper provides valuable information on the use of IoT, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and fuzzy logic in the design of the irrigation system. It also presents the\
    \ results of a study conducted to evaluate the performance of the system, which\
    \ showed significant savings in water and energy consumption, reduction in the\
    \ number of farm workers needed, and increase in crop production. \n\n**Credibility**:\
    \ The paper appears to be well-written and the results are presented in a clear\
    \ and concise manner. The authors have cited several references to support their\
    \ claims. However, the sample size for the study is small, and as such a larger-scale\
    \ study would be needed to verify the findings. \n\n**Scope**: The paper provides\
    \ a comprehensive overview of the smart irrigation system, including the data\
    \ collection, transmission, and analysis. It also discusses the potential benefits\
    \ of the system, such as water and energy savings, reduced labor requirements,\
    \ and increased crop production. \n\n**Recency**: The paper was published in 2023,\
    \ which makes it up-to-date with the current state of knowledge on the topic.\
    \ \n\nOverall, the paper provides valuable insights into the use of different\
    \ data types and their collection and use in the design of smart irrigation systems."

    \ farm-workers from travel to their farms, social distancing and lockdown\nto\
    \ prevent them from getting infected. Consequently, farming and irrigation activities\
    \ are dramatically reduced due to\nshortage of farm-workers and reduction of crops\
    \ production. To find solutions, various technologies have been adopted\nto remotely\
    \ connect farmers with their farm-fields from their homes and perform the same\
    \ work as they are in the farm.\nAn Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern\
    \ sensor technologies, and smart irrigation equipment are coupled to allow\nthe\
    \ collection of the field data for automatic irrigation of the field. This paper\
    \ presents the IoT system based on Fuzzy\nlogic controller that assists farmers\
    \ to receive and monitor necessary irrigation data from the farm field through\
    \ their smart\nphones and PCs. The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed\
    \ in the field to measure the water content in the soil\nand water used for plants\
    \ by measuring the soil moisture dynamics throughout the entire duration of the\
    \ crop growing sea-\nson in the Maize crop farm. The Fuzzy logic controller was\
    \ used for data analytics and intelligent decision making as well\nas Fuzzy logic\
    \ toolbox in MATLAB to simulate irrigation scheduling process. The system saves\
    \ 50% of water and energy\nconsumption for irrigation, 80% reduction of farm-workers\
    \ and increase in 20% of crop production.\nKEYWORDS: Fuzzy logic, Soil moisture,\
    \ IoT, GSM, WSN, Mobile app, MATLAB\nIntroduction\nAgriculture sector is crucial\
    \ to the population welfare as it\nprovides the food, employment and raises the\
    \ national econ-\nomy; In Rwanda, about 96% of its population living in rural\n\
    areas depends mainly on agriculture for their income and it\nis almost impossible\
    \ to survive without this sector. However,\nthe climate change, the irregular\
    \ precipitation and long dry\nseason are negatively affecting the quantity and\
    \ quality of crop\nproduction and results in agriculture production crisis in\
    \ the\nregion. Each agricultural crop has its weather requirements for\ngrowing,\
    \ that’s why the farmers wisely select the right season\nwhen to sow on the basis\
    \ of weather condition (Zhu et al.,\n2020; Patil et al., 2019). Therefore, in\
    \ order to achieve a high\nquantity and quality of crop production by balancing\
    \ weather\ncondition, irrigation is essential.\nThe method used in irrigation\
    \ involves building canals\nwhich supply uniformly water from water resources\
    \ or use of\nwater pumps for spraying water evenly in the field. Never-\ntheless,\
    \ the scarcity of water resources has been a problem that\nimpacts the agriculture\
    \ development. Therefore, A convenient\nirrigation system shall make the agricultural\
    \ process more\neffective (Patil et al., 2019). However, not only the currently\n\
    used methods of irrigation consume more water than what\nplants need, but also\
    \ require farmers to manually and con-\nstantly operate water valves or water\
    \ pumps in case of absence\nor excess of water in the field. In addition, COVID-19\
    \ pan-\ndemic as the biggest health crisis in this decade, due to its\npreventive\
    \ measures taken by different organ around the world\nwhich restrict the people\
    \ to stay at home (lockdown) and\nsocial distancing have severely affected agricultural\
    \ activities\n(Filtjens, n.d.; GSMA, 2021). Therefore, the introduction of\nICT\
    \ in agriculture has emerged as the effective and sustainable\nsolution to improve\
    \ irrigation systems.\nThe emergence and rapid development of IoTs and Big Data\n\
    Analytics presents interesting solutions to the above problem.\n(Badrun and Manaf,\
    \ 2021; Salvi et al., 2017). In this context,\nan IoT system can connect multiple\

    \ that assists farmers to receive\nand monitor the field parameters such as soil\
    \ moisture, and\ntemperature as well as remotely controlling irrigation system\n\
    installed in the farm field through their smart phones and PCs.\nRelated works\n\
    This section presents the cutting-edge studies for currently\navailable related\
    \ solutions. First, threatenings to farmers due\nto COVID-19 pandemic are evaluated\
    \ followed by IoT tech-\nnologies for irrigation and finally the applications\
    \ of Fuzzy\nlogic in agriculture are presented.\n1. Threatening to farmers due\
    \ to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThreatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ has\nexacerbated, especially in developing countries. in Rwanda,\nbig number\
    \ of the citizen are employed in farming activities\nwhere the report shows that\
    \ in 2019 in Rwanda, 64% of the\npopulation was hired in this agriculture sector\
    \ (MINAGRI,\n2020). Since outbreak of COVID-19, one among the effective\nmeasures\
    \ to control the spread of the pandemic was to enforce\nthe citizen to stay-at-home\
    \ (4.I. Workshop: Health systems\nresilience during COVID-19: Lessons for building\
    \ back better,\n2021; Tripathi et al., 2021). The agriculture also was one\namong\
    \ sectors affected by these COVID-19 prevention mea-\nsures. One among affected\
    \ farming parts was irrigation where\nfarmers were restricted to go to irrigate\
    \ their fields and had\nto depend again on rain season only which reduced dramat-\n\
    ically their production (Boughton et al., 2021; Selim and\nEltarabily, 2022).\
    \ nevertheless the IoT was introduced and\nbeing used in agriculture sector, challenges\
    \ of COVID-19 pan-\ndemic have proved that the digital agriculture need to be\
    \ accel-\nerated, where smart irrigation systems are needed for\nautonomous irrigation\
    \ and assisting farmers in remote mon-\nitoring and tracking forming activities\
    \ (GSMA, 2021; Nyakuri\net al., 2022).\n2. IoT connectivity technologies for irrigation\n\
    Wi-Fi connectivity is a widely used wireless communication\ntechnique. Many agricultural\
    \ monitoring systems, such as the\none presented in (Mendez et al., 2012) by Gerard\
    \ Rudolph et\nal and (Hasan et al., 2021), employ Wi-Fi to communicate\namongst\
    \ the various agents of their designs. They demon-\nstrated a Wi-Fi wireless sensor\
    \ network for farm monitoring,\nwith nodes collecting data on temperature, humidity,\
    \ light, soil\nmoisture, and water level. The data was also sent to a server\n\
    so that it could be viewed later. As a result, researching MiFi\ncoverage in various\
    \ agricultural settings is of tremendous\ninterest. In (Mendez et al., 2012; Li\
    \ et al., 2020), Muhammad\nA. et al. reported a method for estimating the location\
    \ of wire-\nless nodes based on signal intensity. The IEEE 802.11 b/g\nstandard\
    \ was used and the locations included urban regions,\nrural areas, woodlands,\
    \ and plantations. However, Wi-Fi\nrequires more internet infrastructure when\
    \ deployed in remote\narea. \nCellular system employs GSM/GPRS standard for data\n\
    communication between field sensor node and the cloud\nserver for data storage\
    \ and further analysis. Additionally, the\nAndroid app is being developed to track\
    \ the system's current\nstate instantly (Science, 2018). In (Munir et al., 2021;\
    \ Yang\net al., 2021), the GSM module was used to connect an IoT\ncloud server\
    \ to a network of sensors, analyzes the data at the\nedge server, transfers only\
    \ a subset of the data to the main\nIoT cloud server to predict the amount of\
    \ water that a field\nof crops will need, and uses an edge Android application\
    \ to\ndisplay the outcome. The IoT devices communicate with cel-\nlular networks\
    \ by using second generation (2G), third gen-\neration (3G), fourth generation\
    \ (4G) and GPRS standards due\nto its relatively long-range wireless communication\
    \ and its\nrobust communication links (Khattab et al., 2019; Science,\n2018).\n\
    Bluetooth Low Energy enabled technology allows IoT\ndevices in irrigation system\
    \ to communicate effectively with\nminimized cost and energy consumption but within\
    \ a short\nNyakuri Jean Pierre et al.\nThis journal is ⓒ Academic Society for\

    \ variable rate irrigation systems with Bluetooth tech-\nnology. The application\
    \ in this article requires plug-and-play\ncompatibility to serial devices with\
    \ affordable wireless com-\nmunication modules in order to accommodate existing\
    \ data\nloggers and sensors. For wireless data transmission between\nin-field\
    \ sensor stations and a base station, the Bluetooth mod-\nule was chosen (Ilapakurti\
    \ and Vuppalapati, 2015) and (Hasan\net al., 2021) used the Bluetooth low energy\
    \ framework to sen-\nsor sensor nodes. Their choice for using Bluetooth low energy,\n\
    also known as Bluetooth Smart, was to maintain a same com-\nmunication range as\
    \ Wi-Fi but using significantly less power\nand cost. When compared to other previous\
    \ stated technol-\nogies used in irrigation, system design optimization, trans-\n\
    mission energy, cost and security can be achieved by improved\nwith the only limitation\
    \ of the device communication range.\n3. Fuzzy logic for Data Management and Analytics\
    \ for\nIrrigation Optimization\nFuzzy logic system determines degree of truth\
    \ for right deci-\nsion making to the problem as that of human perception and\n\
    reasoning can make. Fuzzy logic algorithms are robust and\nadapt easily to the\
    \ changing environments (Jane and Ganesh,\n2019; Pezol et al., 2020) in (Phogat\
    \ et al., 2021) an irrigation\nsystem based on ANN and Fuzzy Logic was developed.\
    \ Soil\nmoisture dynamics, precipitation, evapotranspiration for wheat\ncrop were\
    \ considered. And the results of Fuzzy logic was\nfound suitable with 89% better\
    \ performance due to better deci-\nsion making the lower implementation cost.\
    \ An intelligent\nautomatic control system was developed in (Shongwe, 2022)\n\
    and (Jamroen et al., 2020) using the fuzzy logic controller to\nenable smart irrigation\
    \ based on environmental factors such\nas soil moisture variation, soil Ph, solar\
    \ irradiation, air tem-\nperature, and air humidity. The system showed water and\n\
    energy usage efficiency relatively to the optimal growth of the\nplant.\nAfter\
    \ observing irrigation challenges faced by formers\nduring COVID-19 pandemic and\
    \ reduction of their production\ndue to those challenges, based on the necessity\
    \ of digitali-\nzation in irrigation system and gaps identified in different\n\
    researches, the Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low\nEnergy Consumption was\
    \ developed. It works by deploying\nsensor nodes in the field so that irrigation\
    \ can be done based\non water requirements by the plants to reduce water wastage\n\
    from irrigating unneeded location and assisting farmers in irri-\ngation activities\
    \ using smart device.\nFigure 1. Wireless sensor network architecture of the system.\n\

    \ Technology 2023\nSystem design \n1. System architecture\nThe proposed system\
    \ is illustrated in the Figure 1 and is\ndesigned for semi-automatic irrigation\
    \ system. The sensor\nnodes are deployed in the field and work in WSN mode at\n\
    the edge of the network and consist of sensors, Microcon-\ntroller and ZigBee\
    \ technology and gather all necessary field\ndata to a single gateway. The gateway\
    \ gathers all data sends\ndata to the cloud platform for further analysis. The\
    \ water for\nirrigation came from AKAGERA River and stored in the\nwater reservoir\
    \ where it is pumped to the field by the solar-\npowered pump when it is needed\
    \ by any sensor node in the\nfield. For any sensor node, if the water content\
    \ in the soil get\nbelow the threshold value, the irrigation is done either auto-\n\
    matically or by the farmer according to the weather fore-\ncasting.The field data\
    \ is sent to the cloud platform through the\ngateway using SGM system. The cloud\
    \ plat form receives big\ndata from the field and weather forecasting, analyses\
    \ it, take\ndecision and sent notification to the farmer through smart\nphone\
    \ and PC. The farmer accesses to all field information\nand can operate the irrigation\
    \ system from home (whether to\nirrigate or stop irrigation if it is going to\
    \ rain) using his smart\nphone. \n2. Solar powered sensor node\nThe sensor node\
    \ presented in this project collects data from\nthe given section of the field\
    \ (for this case is 2 ha), processes\nit and communicates it to the gateway which\
    \ is the central unit\nof the WSN. It consists of four main units; the sensing\
    \ unit\nthat employs Hobonet TEROS 12 Soil Moisture/Temperature/\nEC Sensor to\
    \ detect the water content and temperature dynam-\nics in the soil, Atmega 328\
    \ microcontroller which is respon-\nsible for processing data from sensors and\
    \ determine the\nirrigation requirements, communication units using Xbee\nmodule\
    \ for transmitting processed data to the gateway and\nfinally the solar panel\
    \ module for powering the whole device.\n3. Wireless sensor network (WSN)\nWSN\
    \ is the distributed sensor nodes structure that allows\nmany sensor nodes to\
    \ communicate each other wirelessly in\nthe network. In this study, the standalone\
    \ sensor node can\ncover area not more than 2 hectares while the field is 12 hect-\n\
    ares; so, the sensor nodes are connected in the WSN structure\nin order to collect\
    \ the entire field information to the central\nunit (The gateway) for further\
    \ processing and communicating\nthe same data to the cloud for further analysis\
    \ and decision\nmaking. The ZigBee technology has been chosen for their low\n\
    power consumption, low cost and easy transmission compared\nto Lora, Wi-Fi and\
    \ GSM technologies.\nFigure 2. Solar powered sensor node.\nFigure 3. Mobile application\

    \ the google play\nstore. Its dashboard show the farm information and soil con-\n\
    dition with notification to the farmer. The soil moisture level,\nsoil electrical\
    \ conductivity, the battery level of each device and\nthe device ID is shown in\
    \ the dashboard.\n5. System flowchart\nSmart crop irrigation operates by using\
    \ microcontroller\nAtmega 328 which starts by scanning soil moisture, soil tem-\n\
    perature, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Those three\nparameters were\
    \ scanned with help of moisture sensor placed\nto in the soil. Therefore, those\
    \ scanned parameters are sent to\nboth cloud and to mobile phone by using GSM.\
    \ When soil\nmoisture becomes less than twenty four percent, then, turn on\nthe\
    \ pump for irrigating the crop. Otherwise pump is off. The\nelectrical conductivity\
    \ of soil turns pump on while it is\nbecomes greater 570 ms/m. \nFuzzy logic controller\
    \ and MATLAB \nsimulation\n1. Fuzzy logic system for decision making\nFuzzy logic\
    \ approach is a machine learning technique for\ndata analytics and intelligent\
    \ decision making for uncertain\nproblems based on the degree of truth. Fuzzy\
    \ logic helps in\nright decision making as that can be made by human per-\nception\
    \ and reasoning based on the environment variation\nrather than convention true\
    \ or false (1 or 0) logic (Arcos-\nAviles et al., 2021). \n2. Fuzzy inference\
    \ system and membership functions\nFor the simulation of the output based on the\
    \ input variation\nthrough the Fuzzy Logic Controller is done in the Fuzzy logic\n\
    Toolbox in MATLAB (Alfin and Sarno, 2018). The output is\nthe speed variation\
    \ of the electrical pump for irrigation that\ndetermines the quantity of water\
    \ to be irrigated according to\nthe soil state. The soil state is determined by\
    \ the soil moisture,\nFigure 4. System flowchart.\nSmart Crops Irrigation System\

    \ food security, optimizing production efﬁciency, and\npreserving the environment.\
    \ Simultaneously, wireless communication technology holds a critical\nfunction\
    \ within the context of applying the Internet of Things in agriculture. In this\
    \ research endeavor,\nwe present an algorithm for lightweight channel authentication\
    \ based on frequency-domain feature\nextraction. This algorithm aims to distinguish\
    \ between authentic transmitters and unauthorized ones\nin the wireless communication\
    \ context of a representative agricultural setting. To accomplish this,\nwe compiled\
    \ a dataset comprising legitimate and illegitimate communication channels observed\
    \ in\nboth indoor and outdoor scenarios, which are typical in the context of smart\
    \ agriculture. Leveraging\nits exceptional perceptual capabilities and advantages\
    \ in parallel computing, the Transformer has\ninjected fresh vitality into the\
    \ realm of signal processing. Consequently, we opted for the lightweight\nMobileViT\
    \ as our foundational model and designed a frequency-domain feature extraction\

    1. Introduction\nIn smart agriculture, wireless communication technology, as the\
    \ cornerstone of the\nagricultural IoT, will be used in much automation equipment.\
    \ Unlike wired communication,\nwireless communication is not bound by wires. There\
    \ is no need to consider issues such\nas wiring, distance, link maintenance, troubleshooting,\
    \ etc., and the low maintenance cost\nmakes it more suitable to deploy in agricultural\
    \ automation equipment. Therefore, wireless\ncommunication is crucial for developing\
    \ smart agriculture [1–4].\nData privacy and security are the intellectual core\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT) [5],\nand it is important to study how secure\
    \ communication in the IoT can be ensured. To resist\neavesdropping and attacks\
    \ by illegal users and to guarantee the security and reliability\nof communications,\
    \ most communication systems use traditional cryptography-based\ntechniques to\
    \ ensure the security of communications, such as the PKI-based security pro-\n\
    tocol for connected vehicles proposed by Raya et al. [6], where each vehicle is\
    \ equipped\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13092257\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257\n2 of 20\nwith\
    \ multiple private keys and their corresponding certiﬁcates; however, the PKI\
    \ security\nprotocol is inefﬁcient. It can only meet the needs of a few vehicles\
    \ due to its computational\ndifﬁculties. Biswas et al. [7] proposed an ID-based\
    \ proxy approach using signatures, which\ncould improve efﬁciency, but the keys\
    \ are prone to leakage. Asim et al. [8] proposed a\nhierarchical attribute-based\
    \ cryptographic system (HABE) in which the key acts as a leaf,\nbut if the root\
    \ authority is leaked, the whole system is corrupted. Moreover, the implemen-\n\
    tation of the HABE leads to high computational overhead. In the current smart\
    \ agriculture\nIoT, most wireless automated sensors and smart devices must maintain\
    \ low-power op-\neration when unmonitored. The algorithmic complexity of traditional\
    \ cryptography for\nkey distribution and management is high, which results in\
    \ high energy consumption and\nreduced lifetimes for nodes [9], so we need authentication\
    \ methods that are more suitable\nfor smart agriculture.\nCurrently, more and\
    \ more researchers are tending to use channel characteristics for se-\ncure authentication.\
    \ According to electromagnetic propagation theory and the Jakes spectral\nchannel\
    \ model, the channel fading between each transmitter and receiver is independent\n\
    when the distance between different transmitters is better than half a wavelength\
    \ [10], and\nthe channel between the same pair of transceivers changes slowly\
    \ during its coherence\ntime, when the channel is both spacetime-unique and challenging\
    \ to forge. For example,\nShabnam Shaﬁee et al. [11] employed the multiple-input\
    \ single-output (MISO) technique\nto use channel state information in different\
    \ antennas with the same information for beam\nassignment, which was kept as close\
    \ as possible to the main channel direction. Dania\nMarabissi et al. [12] studied\
    \ PHY layer continuous authentication and spoof detection and\nproposed a machine\
    \ learning wireless ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation method for wireless sensor\nnetworks\
    \ (WSNs) that exploits the features of the channel information to verify whether\n\
    the current message is reliable or not.\nTraditional authentication methods usually\
    \ employ signal processing techniques, such\nas computational-spectrum, time-domain,\
    \ and frequency-domain analyses, to detect the\npossibility of illegal signals.\
    \ These methods rely mainly on pre-written rules and thresholds\nto identify illegal\
    \ signals and thus cannot learn and adapt to new illegal signal types and\ncan\
    \ be limited by environmental noise and a lack of signal diversity. In contrast,\
    \ deep\nlearning algorithms can adapt to different data types and tasks [13–16].\
    \ Yadava et al. [17]\nsummarized the application of federated learning in privacy\
    \ preservation and discussed in\ndetail the encryption mechanisms based on federated\
    \ learning. As a subset of deep learning,\nthe utilization of federated learning\
    \ in privacy preservation indirectly demonstrates the\nviability of training deep\
    \ neural networks for channel authentication through the utilization\nof channel\
    \ feature data. Moreover, deep learning algorithms can learn using various smart\n\
    sensors running on massively distributed massive datasets, and they show better\
    \ adaptive\nand generalization capabilities under different environmental conditions.\
    \ This study\napplies deep learning techniques to the channel authentication task\
    \ in smart agriculture\nsettings with complex environments and different device\
    \ functions and locations to obtain\nbetter authentication accuracy.\nAs Transformers\
    \ [18] have made a big splash in the ﬁeld of computer vision, more\nand more researchers\
    \ are utilizing Transformers as a network backbone or drawing on\ntheir ideas\
    \ to improve their algorithms. Transformers are also well suited for use in signal\n\
    processing. Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range\
    \ depen-\ndencies within signals, whether temporal sequences or spatial patterns.\
    \ This enables them\nto better capture correlations between different parts, ultimately\
    \ enhancing processing\naccuracy. Additionally, the Transformer adapts well to\
    \ signal patterns of varying scales\nand frequencies, showcasing exceptional performance\
    \ when handling multiscale signals.\nDuring its training process, the Transformer\
    \ automatically learns representations suited\nto the unique characteristics of\
    \ signals. It can directly extract crucial information from\nraw signals, signiﬁcantly\
    \ streamlining the signal-processing workﬂow and leading to a\nmore automated\
    \ and efﬁcient process. Furthermore, the Transformer boasts the advan-\ntage of\
    \ parallel computing, enabling it to handle large-scale signal data efﬁciently.\
    \ This\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257\n3 of 20\ncharacteristic proves highly beneﬁcial\
    \ for real-time signal processing and managing exten-\nsive signal datasets, effectively\
    \ accelerating the entire processing pipeline and enhancing\nsystem responsiveness.\
    \ Therefore, this study used MobileViT [19] as the backbone. Mo-\nbileViT combines\
    \ convolution with the Transformer to construct a lightweight backbone\nnetwork.\
    \ This study proposes a new channel authentication model called FDFE-MobileViT\n\
    for agricultural environments based on MobileViT.\nThe main contributions of this\

    \ is a lightweight Transformer-based vision model, which is smaller and\nfaster\
    \ than other lightweight ViT models and performs better than other ViT models\
    \ in\nvarious vision tasks. The accuracy of MobileViT is comparable to that of\
    \ other ViT models\nfor various vision tasks. Since MobileViT has fewer parameters,\
    \ it can be more easily loaded\nin a device. Moreover, MobileViT is optimized\
    \ for low computing power and low-power-\nconsumption devices, and its design\
    \ process optimizes the model architecture and training\nmethods for the characteristics\
    \ of a device’s CPU, GPU, and other hardware platforms,\nthus further improving\
    \ the model’s operational efﬁciency while ensuring accuracy. As a\nAgronomy 2023,\
    \ 13, 2257\n7 of 20\nresult, MobileViT has signiﬁcant advantages over other lightweight\
    \ ViT models in terms of\nmodel size, inference speed, portability, and optimization\
    \ for low-arithmetic applications,\nwhich also allows it to provide a feasible\
    \ solution and technical support for the channel\nauthentication task in smart\
    \ agriculture application scenarios.\nThis study used MobileViT as the backbone\
    \ network for feature extraction of channel\nstate information. However, since\
    \ the MobileViT block only fuses features within layers,\nthere is no shortcut\
    \ branching between layers, and the frequency-domain information\nspeciﬁc to the\
    \ signal is not utilized. Therefore, this study proposed to use the frequency-\n\
    domain feature extraction (FDFE) module to improve MobileViT for signal processing\
    \ and\nobtained the FDFE-MobileViT model. Figure 7 shows the overall model architecture\
    \ of\nFDFE-MobileViT.\n \nvarious vision tasks. The accuracy of MobileViT is comparable\
    \ to that of other ViT mode\nfor various vision tasks. Since MobileViT has fewer\
    \ parameters, it can be more easil\nloaded in a device. Moreover, MobileViT is\
    \ optimized for low computing power an\nlow-power-consumption devices, and its\
    \ design process optimizes the model architectur\nand training methods for the\
    \ characteristics of a device’s CPU, GPU, and other hardwar\nplatforms, thus further\
    \ improving the model’s operational efficiency while ensuring accu\nracy. As a\
    \ result, MobileViT has significant advantages over other lightweight ViT mode\n\
    in terms of model size, inference speed, portability, and optimization for low-arithmet\n\
    applications, which also allows it to provide a feasible solution and technical\

    \ scenarios. \nThis study used MobileViT as the backbone network for feature extraction\
    \ of chan\nnel state information. However, since the MobileViT block only fuses\
    \ features withi\nlayers, there is no shortcut branching between layers, and the\
    \ frequency-domain info\nmation speciﬁc to the signal is not utilized. Therefore,\
    \ this study proposed to use th\nfrequency-domain feature extraction (FDFE) module\
    \ to improve MobileViT for signa\nprocessing and obtained the FDFE-MobileViT model.\
    \ Figure 7 shows the overall mode\narchitecture of FDFE-MobileViT. \n \nFigure\
    \ 7. Model structure of FDFE-MobileViT. \nTraditional attention mechanisms and\
    \ feature extraction modules seldom deal wit\nfrequency-domain features [25–28].\
    \ Nevertheless, the signal needs to be analyzed in th\nfrequency domain to obtain\
    \ the spectral characteristics and frequency components, so w\npropose the FDFE\
    \ module to supplement the shortcomings of the existing attentio\nmechanisms.\

    \ consist\nof four parts: FFT, Add Windows, DSC Conv, and AvgPool. FFT transforms\
    \ the imag\nfrom the time domain to the frequency domain so that DSC Conv can\
    \ extract frequen\ncy-domain features. The Add Window operation is similar to\
    \ frequency correction an\nﬁltering, and Avg Pool downscales the features to make\
    \ the output of the FDFE mor\ncompact. \nFigure 7. Model structure of FDFE-MobileViT.\n\

    \ operation is similar to frequency correction and ﬁltering, and\nAvg Pool downscales\
    \ the features to make the output of the FDFE more compact.\nThis model places\
    \ the FDFE module between the existing structures with shortcut-\nbranching-layer\
    \ hopping links allowing the output of Layer2 and Layer3 to be utilized by\nLayer4\
    \ and Layer5 so that each MobileViT block layer can get more information and obtain\n\
    better results.\n2.3.2. Encoder Section\nThe body of FDFE-MoblieViT consists of\
    \ Conv, MV2, FDFE, and MobileViT blocks.\nThe initial layer of FDEF-MobileViT\
    \ is a convolutional layer with a convolutional\nkernel size of 3 × 3. It turns\
    \ the width and height of the data entering the network into one\nhalf of the\
    \ original data.\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257\n8 of 20\nThe signals sent by standard\
    \ communication systems can be treated as nonperiodic\nsignals, which do not show\
    \ repeating patterns over time. When the Fourier transform is\nused, the nonperiodic\
    \ signal becomes a superposition of inﬁnitely periodic sine and cosine\nfunctions\
    \ representing discrete signals in the time domain. After the Fourier transforms,\n\
    the features that are difﬁcult to analyze in the time domain can be demonstrated\
    \ in the\nfrequency domain. Therefore, the FDFE ﬁrst uses the two-dimensional\
    \ discrete Fourier\ntransform to transform the discrete signal in the time domain\
    \ into the frequency domain to\nextract the frequency domain features. A given\
    \ tensor XT ∈ RH×W×C, XT passes through\nthe FFT module, which then transforms\
    \ XT into the frequency domain to obtain XF. The\ntransformation process is given\
    \ by Equation (2):\nXF =\nM−1\n∑\nm=0\nXTe\n−j2πFm\nM\n, F = 0, 1, . . . , M −\
    \ 1\n(2)\nHere, j denotes the imaginary unit; F denotes the subscript of the frequency\
    \ domain\nsampling point, ranging from 0 to M − 1; and m denotes the subscript\
    \ of the time domain\nsampling point, ranging from 0 to M − 1.\nUsually, the imaginary\
    \ part generated by the Fourier transform of the image is ignored.\nStill, the\
    \ signal naturally contains both real and imaginary parts in the initial state\
    \ for non-\nperiodic signals, so the imaginary part also carries information.\
    \ Therefore, the imaginary\npart is not discarded in the FDFE module. Nevertheless,\
    \ the real and imaginary parts are\ngenerated as separate channels in the data\
    \ preprocessing; i.e., the imaginary and real parts\nare treated together as frequency-domain\
    \ features.\nTo eliminate the interference of noise and make the frequency-domain\
    \ data pure for\nsubsequent extraction of frequency-domain features, FDFE uses\
    \ the windowing operation.\nAdding a window to a signal involves multiplying the\
    \ original signal by a window function\nto reduce the leakage of the signal in\
    \ the frequency domain. A ﬁlter can achieve a similar\noperation, but the ﬁlter\
    \ processes or changes the signal characteristics by removing or\nchanging the\
    \ signal in a certain frequency range. In contrast, during signal windowing,\n\
    the signal itself is not ﬁltered and only the amplitude is adjusted. In some cases,\
    \ signal\nwindowing can be considered a special form of ﬁltering. The FDFE in\
    \ this study used the\nwindowing operation shown in Equations (3) and (4) for\
    \ XF:\nWn = 1 −\n\f\f\f\f\n2n\nM − 1 − 1\n\f\f\f\f\n(3)\nXwn = XFn ∗ Wn\n(4)\n\
    where Wn is the set of Bartlett windows; XFn and Xwn are the nth elements of XF\
    \ and Xw,\nrespectively; and Xw is the result for XF after the windowing operation.\n\
    After the frequency-domain conversion and windowing operation, the frequency-\n\
    domain features of the channel image will be more prominent, and Figure 8 shows\
    \ the\nchannel image after the operation.\nFigure 8c,f show the feature maps generated\

    \ indicate that the data\nwere less concentrated around the mean after the windowing\

    \ was skewed toward larger values, and the\nincrease in the median indicates that\
    \ the center of the pixel distribution shifted upward, as\nshown in Figure 9.\

    features of the channel images more obvious.\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257\n9 of 20\n\

    \ Details\nIn this study, the hardware used included an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 5000\
    \ graphics\nprocessing unit (GPU) (NVIDIA Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 16 GB of\
    \ video memory and\n128 GB of RAM, and the central processing unit (CPU) was an\
    \ i9-10900K at 3.7 GHz. The\nsystem was Windows Server 2019 Standard with PyTorch\
    \ version 2.0 and Python version\n3.10. To verify the effectiveness of the FDFE\
    \ module, this study selected the more prominent\ncontemporary ViT models Swin-Transformer\
    \ [30], NextViT [31], and T2T-ViT [32]; the\nlightweight model Mobilenetv3 [33];\
    \ and the benchmark ViT model ConvNexT [34] and\nthe benchmark model MobileViT\
    \ for comparison experiments using similar sized models.\nThe loss function used\
    \ a cross-entropy function. The calculation procedure is given by\nEquation (8):\n\
    Loss = − 1\nN\nN\n∑\ni=1\nyilog(ˆyi)\n(8)\nwhere N is the number of samples in\
    \ the dataset, yi denotes the ith sample, and ˆyi denotes\nthe prediction probability\
    \ of the ith sample.\n3.2. Training Networks\nFDFE-MobileViT was implemented in\
    \ the Pytorch 2.0 environment and trained using\nthe server mentioned in Section\
    \ 3.1; the optimizer was an SGD optimizer with default\nparameters trained with\
    \ 200 epochs, a batch size of 64, and an initial learning rate of 0.001,\nand\
    \ the learning rate was adjusted using the cosine annealing method. The computation\
    \ is\ngiven by Equation (9):\nlr = lrf+1\n2(lri−lrf)\n\x12\n1 + cos\n\x12 Tcur\n\
    Tmax\nπ\n\x13\x13\n(9)\nwhere lr denotes the current learning rate, lrf denotes\
    \ the ﬁnal decay rate of the learning\nrate, lri denotes the initial learning\
    \ rate, Tcur denotes the current number of training rounds,\nand Tmax denotes\
    \ the total number of training rounds. The learning rate was changed\naccording\
    \ to the number of training rounds to achieve a better training effect.\n4. Discussion\n\

    \ Module Internal Ablation Experiments\nTo ensure that each component of the FDFE\
    \ module contributed effectively to feature\nextraction, this study conducted\
    \ ablation experiments within the FDFE framework. These\nexperiments individually\
    \ validated the utilization of real and imaginary parts of the data,\nthe effectiveness\
    \ of the signal windowing component, and the impact of DSC Conv. The\ninternal\
    \ ablation experiments within the module were divided into three parts:\n1.\n\
    Utilization of only the real part obtained from the FFT in the FDFE module compared\n\
    to the utilization of both real and imaginary parts;\n2.\nRemoval of the signal\
    \ windowing component to contrast its effects with the process\nwith windowing\
    \ included;\n3.\nSubstitution of DSC Conv with a regular 2D convolution to compare\
    \ the performance\nand parameter count.\nReplacing the DSC Conv within the FDFE\
    \ module with a standard 2D convolution,\nas depicted in Figures 14 and 15, yielded\
    \ comparable results. Furthermore, as shown in\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257\n13 of\
    \ 20\nFigures 16 and 17, the convergence rates of both methods also tended to\
    \ align. However,\nas indicated in Table 3, adopting the DSC Conv led to a reduction\
    \ in model parameters.\nHence, the use of DSC Conv holds signiﬁcance.\n \nTable\

    In the indoor static environment, FDFE-MobileViT had 32 indoor legal channels\n\
    predicted as illegal channels and 13 illegal indoor channels predicted as legal\
    \ channels.\nIn comparison, the unimproved MobileViT had 104 illegal channels\
    \ predicted as legal\nchannels and 44 legal channels predicted as illegal channels\
    \ in the indoor case. The\ncomparison algorithm used in ConvNeXt was the best.\
    \ In the dynamic indoor environment,\nthe comparison algorithms used in ConvNeXt,\
    \ Swin-Transformer, and MobileNetv3 were\nall more effective. Nevertheless, FDFE-MobileViT\
    \ was in the lead, with fewer prediction\nerrors than the above three algorithms.\n\
    By comparing the channel feature matrixes in the indoor environment with the gener-\n\
    ated feature maps, it was found that the difference between the channel feature\
    \ matrixes\nfor the legal and illegal channels in the indoor environment was manageable.\
    \ Observing\nnoticeable differences in the generated maps of the channel feature\
    \ matrixes using the\nnaked eye was challenging. The similarity of several classes\
    \ was very high, which could\nhave led to the model’s inability to distinguish\
    \ the difference between classes in the indoor\ncase during the extraction of\
    \ features. However, the total number of prediction errors\nremained low and acceptable.\n\
    In the static outdoor environment, FDFE-MobileViT did not predict illegal channels\
    \ as\nlegal channels or legal channels as illegal channels. In contrast, MobileViT\
    \ predicted eight\nillegal channels as legal channels and seven illegal channels\
    \ as legal channels. Similarly,\nwe found slight differences between the outdoor\
    \ legal and illegal channels by looking\nat the data collected in the outdoor\
    \ environment. The generated feature maps were still\nindistinguishable with the\

    \ consideration. Chen et al. [35] in-\ntroduced a cluster-based physical-layer\
    \ authentication algorithm that integrates clustering\nand lightweight symmetric\
    \ cryptography with channel state information to enhance authen-\ntication accuracy.\
    \ The research assumed that the terminal servers are high-performance,\nwhile\
    \ devices in agricultural environments typically possess limited arithmetic power\
    \ and\nmay not meet the required computational demands. In contrast, the lightweight\
    \ model pro-\nposed in this study necessitates fewer computational resources for\
    \ the device and avoids\nthe use of cryptographic assistance, thus making it more\
    \ compatible with agricultural\ndevices. Xiao et al. [36] proposed a scheme based\
    \ on machine learning (ML) to achieve\nthreshold-free physical-layer authentication\
    \ across multiple landmarks. This approach can\nachieve higher authentication\
    \ accuracy and reduced costs, but it requires the deployment\nof a signiﬁcant\
    \ number of peripheral devices, which is not cost-effective for agricultural\n\
    environments. In contrast, our study’s model does not require additional devices,\
    \ resulting\nin lower costs.\nThe training data also inﬂuence the contexts in\
    \ which the model can be applied.\nLiao et al. [37] introduced a data augmentation-based\
    \ multi-user PHY layer authentication\nscheme. Similarly to our study, their research\
    \ utilized dynamic and static channel data\nfrom real-world factory environments.\
    \ However, there are signiﬁcant domain differences\nbetween industrial and agricultural\
    \ data. Networks trained on industrial datasets may not\nbe suitable for agricultural\
    \ settings. Our model, developed using self-collected agricultural\nenvironment\
    \ data, is better suited for such contexts. This study concatenated raw data\n\
    to form multidimensional training and validation data. We processed the raw data\
    \ into\nRGB images, avoiding redundancy while facilitating convenient input to\
    \ various networks.\nWhile Liao et al. employed a more conventional DNN model,\
    \ we utilized the lightweight\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2257\n17 of 20\nMobileViT model\
    \ as a foundation and improved and optimized it for signal features,\nachieving\
    \ superior authentication performance.\nMost models seldom utilize the frequency-domain\
    \ information for signal data com-\npared to image data. However, the frequency-domain\
    \ information for the signal contains\nthe frequency component, frequency-domain\
    \ amplitude, phase, and other signal informa-\ntion; this study proposed an FDFE\
    \ module and used it to improve the MobileViT model.\nThe FDFE module extracts\
    \ the feature information in the signal’s frequency domain to\nobtain more features,\
    \ providing more information for the model to learn and remove in\naddition to\
    \ the color. In this study, the authentication effect of FDFE-MobileViT was ex-\n\
    perimentally veriﬁed in natural smart agriculture indoor and outdoor environments.\
    \ This\nstudy compared FDFE-MobileViT with Swin-Transformer, NextViT, T2T-ViT,\
    \ Mobilenetv3,\nConvNeXt, and MobileViT. A side-by-side comparison was conducted.\
    \ FDFE-MobileViT\nachieved the best accuracy among the seven models at 96.6% with\
    \ a small volume. The\nmodel proposed in this study may encounter the following\
    \ challenges when deployed in\nlarge-scale agricultural settings. The diverse\
    \ nature of large-scale agricultural environments,\nencompassing varying types\
    \ of ﬁelds, crops, geographical conditions, and weather scenar-\nios, contributes\
    \ to data heterogeneity. Collecting extensive and diverse datasets at a large\n\
    scale could present a challenge, particularly when acquiring data across different\
    \ seasons\nand locations. In agricultural contexts, many applications necessitate\
    \ real-time responsive-\nness and low latency, such as autonomous machinery and\
    \ live monitoring. Addressing\nthese requirements may involve optimizations in\
    \ both model design and deployment strate-\ngies. In expansive agricultural landscapes,\
    \ resource availability for hardware deployment\ncould be restricted. Deep learning\
    \ models typically demand substantial computational\nresources and storage capacity.\
    \ Consequently, devising approaches to deploy models\nwithin resource-constrained\
    \ environments is crucial, often entailing model compression,\nlightweight architectures,\
    \ and acceleration techniques.\nThis study enhances the security of the agricultural\
    \ IoT by combining MobileViT\nwith the FDFE module. This amalgamation effectively\
    \ strengthens the security of the\nagricultural Internet of Things, enabling more\
    \ efﬁcient protection of critical data and com-\nmunication within the smart agriculture\
    \ environment. Due to the lightweight nature of\nFDFE-MobileViT, it is more easily\
    \ deployable with agricultural equipment, facilitating\nsecure and dependable\
    \ data transmission to elevate agricultural efﬁciency. Moreover, this\nresearch\
    \ holds signiﬁcant managerial implications. It provides agricultural managers\
    \ with\na foundational framework for making informed decisions and implementing\
    \ security mea-\nsures, enabling them to better utilize limited resources and\
    \ enhance management efﬁciency.\nThis study centers on channel authentication\
    \ within smart agricultural environments.\nDuring the data collection phase, we\
    \ focused solely on a single area of crop farmland. As\na result, other types\
    \ of farmland, such as tea ﬁelds and fruit orchards, were not included\nin our\
    \ dataset. In our future research endeavors, we will expand our data collection\n\
    efforts to encompass a broader range of agricultural environments. This expansion\
    \ will\nallow us to extend our model’s applicability to more intricate settings.\
    \ Additionally,\nwe are considering the incorporation of more advanced backbone\
    \ networks to enhance\nthe overall performance of our model. Furthermore, we are\
    \ exploring the possibility of\nadapting these advanced backbone networks to further\
    \ optimize our model’s performance.\nLooking ahead, we intend to extend the methodology\
    \ employed in this study to various\nother environments, including factory and\
    \ ofﬁce settings. This approach aligns with our\ncommitment to maintaining consistency\
    \ in our research focus and broadening the scope of\nour methodologies.\nAuthor\

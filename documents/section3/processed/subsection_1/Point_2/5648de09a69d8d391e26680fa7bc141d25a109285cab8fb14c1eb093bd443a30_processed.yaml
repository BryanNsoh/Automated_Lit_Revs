    \ rice based on long-range + unmanned aerial vehicle\n(LoRa + UAV) has been proposed\
    \ in this paper to meet the requirements of diﬃcult deployment, low scalability,\
    \ and poor network\nreliability of traditional farmland environmental monitoring\
    \ systems. +e system automatically forms a double-layer star topology\nnetwork\
    \ through the terminal node and central node (intranet), central node, and UAV\
    \ mobile node (extranet). Data trans-\nmission is carried out through LoRa technology,\
    \ routing planning is carried out for UAV mobile receiving nodes at diﬀerent ﬂight\n\
    altitudes, and an early warning mechanism for UAV energy is added. It eﬀectively\
    \ prevents the UAV from destroying the\ncommunication capability of the external\
    \ network due to energy exhaustion during operation. +e system transmits information\n\
    remotely to the server of the management center through a 5G network, which analyzes\
    \ and processes the data and publishes it on\nthe Web. +e system has been tested\
    \ in the ﬁeld, and the reliable communication range of the node is 1∼4 km under\
    \ the saline-\nalkali-tolerant rice environment, and the service life of the terminal\
    \ node can reach more than 3 months. During continuous\noperation, the maximum\
    \ packet loss rate of the internal and external integrated networks is 1.45%.\
    \ +e system can stably and real-\ntime monitor saline-alkali-tolerant rice environmental\
    \ information, and the error rate is less than 10%, which can meet the\nperformance\
    \ requirements of the saline-alkali-tolerant rice environmental monitoring systems,\
    \ such as low power consumption,\nwide coverage, stability, and reliability, and\
    \ has a good engineering signiﬁcance.\n1. Introduction\nSaline-alkali-tolerant\
    \ rice is a rice variety that can grow in\nsaline (alkaline) land with a salt\
    \ (alkaline) concentration of\n0.3% or more. China is rich in saline land resources,\
    \ such as\nthe semidesert interior of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia, the\nYellow\
    \ Triangle Agricultural Highlands, and the Northeast\nSongnen Plain, and other\
    \ saline areas, which according to\nstatistics, can reach 1.5 billion mu [1].\
    \ With the increasing\nscarcity of arable land resources, it is signiﬁcant to\
    \ promote\nthe cultivation of saline-alkali-tolerant rice with high salinity\n\
    tolerance. Smart agriculture is one of the important ways to\nsolve the series\
    \ of key problems of “saline-alkali tolerant\nrice” such as mass green cultivation,\
    \ yield improvement, and\npest control [2]. +e special growth environment of saline-\n\
    alkali-tolerant rice has many problems, such as a wide area of\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring, a strong corrosive environment,\nand diﬃcult network deployment;\
    \ conventional monitoring\nmethods are diﬃcult to realize. WSN technology can\
    \ ef-\nfectively solve these problems. WSN is a wireless sensor\nnetwork composed\
    \ of sensor nodes deployed in the mon-\nitoring area in a wireless self-organizing\
    \ network, which can\naccurately implement the information of the monitored\n\
    objects [3]. At present, the widely used communication\ntechnologies are mainly\
    \ ZigBee and LoRa technologies.\nZigBee communication technology [4] has the advantages\
    \ of\nlow power consumption and support for a variety of to-\npologies, but there\
    \ are problems such as limited node\ncommunication distance, low reliability,\
    \ unstable network,\nand high overall network power consumption, which are not\n\
    suitable for the design of wide coverage, stable, and low-\npower saline-alkali-tolerant\
    \ rice environment system. LoRa\nHindawi\nAdvances in Materials Science and Engineering\n\

    RETRACTED\ntechnology is a typical representative of LPWAN technology,\nwhich\
    \ has the advantages of low energy consumption, wide\ncoverage, reliable connection,\
    \ and easy deployment, and has\nbecome a hot research technology in the ﬁeld of\
    \ Internet of\nthings (IoT) in recent years [5, 6]. LoRa communication\ntechnology\
    \ is more suitable for ﬁeld-wide sensor informa-\ntion collection and application\
    \ in terms of node commu-\nnication range, the number of nodes deployed, and\n\
    environmental applicability. +e comparison of the main\nparameters of ZigBee and\
    \ LoRa communication technolo-\ngies is shown in Table 1.\nScholars in this ﬁeld\
    \ have done a lot of work on the\napplication of LoRa communication technology\
    \ in agri-\nculture. A. Catini et al. [7] developed a LoRa data terminal\nnode\
    \ with low power consumption. +e power consumption\nof the LoRa terminal node\
    \ was reduced by optimizing the\nspread spectrum factor and transmission power\
    \ of LoRa,\nusing a magnetic latching relay to supply power to sensors\non-demand,\
    \ and comprehensively calculating the theoretical\nworking time of the terminal\
    \ node. It provides a theoretical\nbasis for the LoRa terminal node design of\
    \ the saline-alkali-\ntolerant rice environmental monitoring system in this paper.\n\
    M. Swain et al. [8] proposed a LoRa+5G-based low-cost\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ IoT system, using self-developed\nLoRa-IoT smart gateways to interconnect and\
    \ interoperate\nall kinds of sensors and regional signal coverage by means of\n\
    wireless self-organizing networks, and then connect LoRa\nbase stations with 5G\
    \ base stations to realize the up-and-\ndown penetration of data. It can provide\
    \ a reference for the\nconstruction of the LoRa+5G saline-alkali-tolerant rice\n\
    environmental monitoring model in this paper. C. Gaia et al.\n[9] proposed an\
    \ intelligent agricultural IoTarchitecture based\non LoRaWAN and LoRaRarm platform,\
    \ in which LoRaWAN\nrealizes the collection and transmission of agricultural data,\n\
    which are transmitted to the remote LoRaRarm platform\nthrough the base station.\
    \ Finally, it realizes data processing\nanddisplay,whichprovidesareferenceforthemodulardesign\n\
    of the internal and external network of the rice environment\nmonitoring system\
    \ in this paper. X. Feng et al. [10] com-\nprehensively compared three wireless\
    \ communication tech-\nnologies, narrowband Internet of things (NB-IoT), LoRa,\
    \ and\nZigBee, and pointed out that ZigBee is a better choice for\nsmall- and\
    \ medium-scale agricultural monitoring environ-\nments, while LoRa and NB-IoTare\
    \ suitable for application in\nﬁeld large-scale agricultural monitoring environment.\n\
    Traditional sensor nodes transmit data to the gateway\nnodes by single or multihop,\
    \ and some nodes die prema-\nturely due to high energy consumption causing network\n\
    communication interruptions. Mobile collection nodes in-\nstead of traditional\
    \ WSN static collection nodes to form\nmobile sink WSN (MSWSN) are gradually becoming\
    \ a re-\nsearch hotspot [11, 12]. In MSWSN, unmanned aerial ve-\nhicle (UAV) is\
    \ generally used as a mobile node to reduce the\nnumber of hops of data packets\
    \ from the source node to the\ndestination node and shorten the transmission distance\
    \ be-\ntweenthesourcenodeanddestinationnode,thusreducingthe\nenergy consumption\
    \ and packet loss in the process of data\ntransmission. Which can improve the\
    \ communication quality\nandsurvivaltimeofthewholesystem[13–15].P.Danetal.[16]\n\
    proposed a three-tier WSN architecture that meets the in-\nformation sampling\
    \ and data service requirements of farm-\nland environment in South China by using\
    \ UAV combined\nwith a low-power wireless sensor network and studied the\noptimizationofsystemparameterssuchasUAVﬂightaltitude\n\
    and average communication time between UAV and relay\nnodes, but the system has\
    \ high power consumption and weak\ntraﬃc stability between WSN and UAV. B. Manlio\
    \ et al. [17]\ndesigned the UAV ground-sensor network communication\nproblem based\
    \ on IEEE802.15.4 and pointed out that the\nactual transmission distance of IEEE802.15.4\
    \ limits the UAV\nﬂight range, which is not suitable for deployment in agri-\n\
    cultural environments with a wide monitoring area. O. Fan\net al. [18] divided\
    \ the monitoring area into three independent\nplot areas, built a WSN network\
    \ with subclustering, and used\nthe mobile acquisition nodes on the UAV to communicate\n\
    with UAV ﬂight trajectory through the information inter-\naction of independent\
    \ subnetworks on the ground to transmit\nfarmland information. +e experimental\
    \ results show the\ncommunication quality of UAV-WSN compared with that of\nstaticWSN;theaveragelinkconsumptionofplots1,2,\
    \ and3is\nreduced by about 10%, 27%, and 14%, and the average packet\nloss rate\
    \ is reduced by about 24%, 68%, and 29%, respectively.\nG. Just et al. [19] using\
    \ the management concept of time slot\nand the thought of combining no-ﬂy list,\
    \ put forward a kind of\neﬀective detection and reconstruction algorithm of sensor\n\
    node activation time, the path planning of unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) to synchronize\
    \ with the activation of each\nsensor node cycle, thereby reducing the UAV’s ﬂight\
    \ time,\nreducing the power consumption of the node, and shortening\nthe UAV’s\
    \ ﬂight path. However, after the node timeslot of this\nmodel is reconﬁgured,\
    \ the UAV routing needs to be\nreprogrammed, which increases the energy cost of\
    \ the node\nand UAV.\nIn summary, when LoRa nodes generally communicate\ndirectly\
    \ with the gateway through a single hop, it is easy for\nsome nodes to transmit\
    \ too long a distance from the\ngateway, resulting in high node energy consumption\
    \ and\npacket loss. In addition, the coverage of the network is\nlimited by only\
    \ relying on nodes to communicate directly\nwith the gateway. +erefore, this paper\
    \ considers UAV as a\nmobile collection node, which can not only repeat multiple\n\
    times to perform many types of information collection tasks\nbut also reach remote\
    \ areas and expand the range of col-\nlection. By adjusting the communication\
    \ distance between\nUAV and static LoRa terminal nodes, the communication\ncapability\
    \ is optimized to improve the accuracy of data\nTable 1: Comparison of main parameters\

    \ terminal monitoring system (UAV saline-alkali-\ntolerant rice environmental\
    \ monitoring system, UAV-\nSREMS) based on LoRa + UAV to meet the demand of\n\
    saline-alkali-tolerant rice environmental information ac-\nquisition according\
    \ to the characteristics and requirements\nof saline-alkali-tolerant rice-growing\
    \ environment. +e\nsystem plans the routing of UAV acquisition nodes at dif-\n\
    ferent ﬂight altitudes and incorporates a UAV energy\nwarning mechanism to prevent\
    \ the UAV from crashing due\nto energy depletion during operation. Considering\
    \ the re-\nmote communication, this paper adopts a combination of\n“LoRa + UAV\
    \ +5G″ technology to design the saline-alkali-\ntolerant rice environmental monitoring\
    \ system.\n2. UAV-SREMS System Model\n2.1. UAV-SREMS System Structure. +e saline-alkali-toler-\n\
    ant rice environmental monitoring system consists of ele-\nments such as terminal\
    \ sensor nodes, static central nodes,\nUAV mobile nodes, base stations, and remote\
    \ terminals; the\nsystem structure is shown in Figure 1.\n+e system divides the\
    \ farmland monitoring area into\nmultiple subregions according to the node area\
    \ division, and\ndeploys multiple terminal nodes and a central node in each\n\
    subregion. +e terminal nodes in the subregion and the\ncentral node form a layer\
    \ of star topology network (intranet)\nthrough LoRa communication technology to\
    \ realize the real-\ntime collection and transmission of the environmental in-\n\
    formation of saline-alkali-tolerant rice, and the central node\nis responsible\
    \ for collecting and caching the information of\nthe sensor nodes. +e UAV mobile\
    \ collection nodes and\nmultiple subregional center nodes form a two-layer star\n\
    topology network structure (extranet) to realize the col-\nlection of information\
    \ collected by the UAV mobile nodes\nfrom the subregional center nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the base\nstation through LoRa communication technology. +e base\nstation\
    \ transmits it to the remote data center through a 5G\ngateway, and the back-end\
    \ management system supports\nusers to access it through the web end and Android\
    \ end to\ncomplete the real time of all monitoring data display,\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ query, history query, and other functions.\n2.2.UAV-SREMSNetworkStructure. For\
    \ the convenience of\nresearch, the whole UAV-SREMS network model in this\npaper\
    \ mainly consists of a sensor node data acquisition layer,\nUAV data transmission\
    \ layer, and terminal data aggregation\nand processing layer, as shown in Figure\
    \ 2.\n2.2.1. Sensor Node Acquisition Layer. +e terminal nodes\nconsist of various\
    \ RS485 sensors and LoRa data collectors,\nwhich are evenly distributed in the\
    \ saline-alkali-tolerant\nrice monitoring area and form a wireless ad-hoc network\n\
    into a single-hop star topology with the central node.\nVarious sensors can sense\
    \ and collect information on the\nsaline-alkali-tolerant rice growth environment\
    \ such as soil\ntemperature and humidity, pH value, salinity, and air\ntemperature\
    \ and humidity in real time, and transmit it to\nthe LoRa data collector through\
    \ 485 communications.\nGenerally, the nodes are battery powered, so the nodes\n\
    sleep for a long time to reduce energy consumption. +e\nlocation of the central\
    \ node is ﬁxed, is responsible for\ncollecting and caching terminal node information\
    \ through\nthe LoRa wireless receiving module, and waits for the\nwake-up of the\
    \ UAV mobile node. Because of the high\nenergy consumption of the central node,\
    \ solar power is\nused.\n2.2.2. UAV Data Transmission Layer. +e transmission\n\
    layer uses UAV as a mobile receiver node and establishes\na two-layer single-hop\
    \ star topology network with\nmultiple subregional central nodes through LoRa\
    \ WAN\ntechnology, which is responsible for data collection and\ntransmission\
    \ from the central nodes, and as the UAV can\nbe recycled it is battery powered.\
    \ According to the co-\nordinate information of the central node and ﬂight al-\n\
    titude, determine the optimal position of the UAV, plan\nthe ﬂight path, and establish\

    oped by Visual Studio 2010 development tool and C#\nlanguage, using MySQL database\
    \ to store the real-time data of\neach node, and the stored data are exported\

    \ an interactive interface for the user.\nUsers access this website by logging\

    \ of UAV-SREMS\n3.1. System Model. For a farmland environmental moni-\ntoring\
    \ sensor network with multiple monitored environ-\nmental variables, node deployment\
    \ in farmland needs to\nconsider node spatial distribution in environmental vari-\n\
    ables and node communication performance. According to\nthe node area division,\
    \ the monitoring area is divided into\nsubregions. Assume that the monitoring\
    \ area is L×L, then\nthe monitoring area is divided into N×N l×l small areas.\
    \ +e\nsize of l is taken as the communication radius of the central\nnode r. In\
    \ order to ensure that all nodes in the small area are\nwithin the communication\
    \ range of the central node, l\nshould satisfy formula (1). After the farmland\
    \ is divided into\nregions, a right-angle coordinate system is established.\n\
    l ≤\n\x81\n2\n√\nr.\n(1)\nA ﬁxed central node is placed at the midpoint of each\n\
    small region; there are N×N central nodes and the set of\ncentral node location\

    moving location point can be connected with four central\nnodes. +en, the coordinate\
    \ position distribution of the\ncentral nodes and the acquisition path of the\
    \ UAV are shown\nin Figure 8.\n+e air node uses an eight-rotor UAV with a maximum\n\
    load of 5 kg. +e UAV carries a power supply, a LoRa\ncommunication module, and\
    \ a data processing module, and\nthe central node mainly consists of a solar power\
    \ module and\na LoRa data-forwarding module. +e terminal nodes are\ncomposed of\
    \ various sensors and LoRa data collectors, and\nthe main sensor performance indicators\
    \ are shown in Table 3.\nIt can be calculated that the ﬂight altitude H of a UAV\
    \ is\nabout 0–1.2 km, and the average communication time of\neach node for transmitting\
    \ data is 10 seconds.\n+e wireless channels in the saline-alkali-tolerant rice\n\
    environment are complex, and there may be channel con-\ngestion or climate interference,\
    \ which may lead to system\npacket loss. +erefore, during the experiment of this\
    \ system,\npacket loss data information is counted by the gateway: the\nterminal\
    \ nodes send a total of 10251 data, 149 packet loss\ndata, and the packet loss\
    \ rate is 1.45%, which prove the\nstability of continuous data transmission of\
    \ the system.\nIn this paper, according to the environmental moni-\ntoring needs\
    \ of saline-alkali-tolerant rice, a set of data are\nforwarded for 15 minutes\
    \ as a cycle, the sampling frequency\nof the sensor is 1 time/30 seconds, and\
    \ its main parameters\nare set as shown in Figure 9.\n+e power consumption parameters\
    \ of LoRa terminal\nnodes in one cycle are shown in Table 4.\nFrom E \x88 UIT,\
    \ the power consumption of the terminal\nnode for one data upload is about Eonce\
    \ \x88 8.1 J (powered by\n12V, 2000mAh battery), and the working time is 117 d.\n\
    Considering the tiny power consumption of the power\nsupply buck module and the\
    \ instantaneous power con-\nsumption of the relay switch, the total working time\
    \ should\nbe slightly less than 117 d.\n+e collected data are uploaded to the\
    \ remote server\nthrough the LoRa gateway integrated with 5G, and then the\ndata\
    \ are parsed, processed, and stored in the database, and\npart of saline-alkali-tolerant\

    Web pages, as shown in Table 5.\nTo verify the stability of the system, TNHY-11\
    \ handheld\nagricultural environmental monitoring instrument was used\nto calibrate\
    \ the collected data, data logging was performed\nevery 2 hours, and the values\
    \ of the parameters obtained\nfrom the system were compared with the values tested;\
    \ a part\nof the data are shown in Figure 11. It can be seen from\nFigure 11 that\
    \ the ﬁtting degree of the data monitored by the\nsystem and the measured data\
    \ is good, which can realize the\nrequirements of real-time monitoring and stable\
    \ transmis-\nsion of saline-alkali-tolerant rice environmental data, and\nthe\
    \ system monitoring data have high accuracy.\n+e error rate between the measured\
    \ parameter values\nand the system-acquired parameter values is calculated as\n\
    shown in the following formula :\nError rate \x88 |System data − measured data|\n\
    measured data\n× 100%.\n(10)\n+e resulting error rate of each parameter is shown\
    \ in\nFigure 12. It can be seen from Figure 12 that there are errors\nbetween\
    \ the collected data and the measured data of the\nhandheld agricultural environmental\
    \ monitoring instru-\nment, but the error rate is less than 10% because the sys-\n\
    tematic error data are mainly caused by the network\ncollection and transmission.\
    \ +e sensor instruments used in\nthe experimental data collection are all high\
    \ precision, and\nthe system error data mainly come from the packaging and\ncompression\
    \ of the data in the process of the system channel\ntransmission, the saline-alkali\
    \ environment, and the low\nsignal coverage of the base station. However, after\
    \ the data\nprocessing of the system, the results are still relatively\naccurate.\n\
    5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we analyze the existing traditional agricultural\n\
    environmental system for the demand of rice environment\nmonitoring applications\
    \ and propose a low power con-\nsumption wireless sensor network based on LoRa\
    \ + UAV for\nthe rice growth environment monitoring system. +e\ncombination of\
    \ LoRa communication technology and UAV\nrealizes remote data acquisition and\
    \ transmission with low\npower consumption, low time delay, and high reliability\
    \ for a\nlarge area coverage of saline-alkali-tolerant rice, which can\nmeet the\
    \ actual monitoring demand of saline-alkali-tolerant\nrice growth environment.\
    \ Due to the special characteristics\nof the saline-alkali-tolerant rice growth\
    \ environment, the\nfollowing work is needed in the future: ① long-term saline-\n\
    alkali-tolerant rice growth environment tests, research on\nkey technologies such\
    \ as saline-alkali-tolerant rice growth\nenvironment channels, communication modes,\
    \ and routing\nalgorithms to improve the eﬀectiveness and reliability of\nsystem\
    \ communication; ② research on data fusion algo-\nrithms applicable to saline-alkali-tolerant\
    \ rice environment\nmonitoring at the gateway node, and adding big data\nanalysis\
    \ and cloud computing technology to the back-end\nserver combined with relevant\
    \ algorithms in the ﬁeld of\nartiﬁcial intelligence to further improve the system\
    \ intelli-\ngence; and ③ research on the routing algorithm of multiple\nUAVs as\
    \ mobile collection nodes to assist the operation and\nimprove transmission eﬃciency.\n\
    In this paper, to meet the requirements of special and\nlong-time wide-range monitoring\
    \ of saline-alkali-tolerant\nrice growth environment, an IoT system for real-time\
    \ col-\nlection, processing, and transmission of environmental\nfactor information\
    \ such as salinity, soil temperature hu-\nmidity, air temperature, and humidity\
    \ of saline-alkali-tol-\nerant rice is realized, which provides a new technical\
    \ means\nfor saline-alkali-tolerant rice growth environment moni-\ntoring and\
    \ has broad application prospects.\nData Availability\n+e data that support the\

    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  analysis: 'Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use


    This study analyzes how the collection and utilization of different data types,
    such as soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather data, contribute to the
    AI-based applications in agriculture. Specifically, it examines how these data
    are gathered, transmitted, and processed to develop actionable insights for farmers
    and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector.


    The paper explores the data collection methods, including edge and fog computing,
    real-time data transmission protocols, and the challenges and solutions associated
    with real-time data transmission in agricultural settings. It also discusses the
    data processing techniques used to extract meaningful information from the collected
    data and the role of AI algorithms in analyzing and interpreting the data to generate
    actionable recommendations.

    Today, AI is widely employed in several fields, and its applications are progressing,\n\
    becoming more precise and performant, including manufacturing (Bagnoli et al.,\
    \ 2022),\nhealthcare (Cobianchi et al., 2023; Loftus et al., 2020), banking and\
    \ finance (Doumpos et al.,\n2023), aviation (Kulida and Lebedev, 2020) and hospitality\
    \ (Goel et al., 2022). Among its\nseveral applications, AI is being employed in\
    \ the agricultural field as well, with the aim of\nimproving yield, efficiency\
    \ and profitability (Dal Mas et al., 2023) and developing economic\nforecasts\
    \ (Chu et al., 2019; Lebelo et al., 2022). AI in the agricultural sector includes\
    \ innovative\ntechnologies such as field sensors, drones, farm management software\
    \ tools, automated\nmachinery and water and fertilizer management solutions (Arora\
    \ et al., 2022; Misra et al.,\n2022; Romanello and Veglio, 2022; Trivelli et al.,\
    \ 2019). In this category, new innovative\nfarming techniques such as vertical\
    \ farming (Biancone et al., 2022; Musa and Basir, 2021;\nSaad et al., 2021), aquaculture,\
    \ insect breeding and precision agriculture can be included (Dal\nMas et al.,\
    \ 2023; Trivelli et al., 2019).\nAI in agriculture can play a strategic role.\
    \ Indeed, at a global level, the agricultural sector\nhas a value of 3,6 trillion\
    \ dollars, providing the 4% of the global gross domestic product (GDP)\nwith a\
    \ stable measure during the last twenty years. Moreover, in some developing countries,\n\
    it accounts for more than 25% of GDP (FAO, 2022). Such a critical industry stands\
    \ as a food\nand energy base of the new economy, mainly because it ensures food\
    \ security (Magasumovna\net al., 2017).\nStill, various implicit problems have\
    \ been historically challenging the agricultural sector.\nThe first of such issues\
    \ is undoubtedly the number of workers which is significantly\ncollapsed with\
    \ a progressive difficult-to-employ workforce. For instance, between 2000 and\n\
    2022, the global workforce employed in agriculture collapsed from 40% to 27%,\
    \ representing\na reduction of 177 million people (FAO, 2022). These data underline\
    \ the technological impact\nin this field in the last century, with a food production\
    \ increment per person less than\nproportional with the population growth; this\
    \ previous more than doubled between 1950 and\n1998 (Sunding and Zilbermanof,\
    \ 2001). In the last years, there has been a similar trend with an\nincreasing\
    \ population but decreasing productivity caused by climate change and\ndesertification,\
    \ with a decline of 134 million hectares of cultivated land between 2000 and\n\
    2020 (FAO, 2022). For these reasons, achieving food security in a sustainable\
    \ way is one of the\nobjectives included in the United Nations (UN) 2030 Sustainable\
    \ Goals with the Zero-Hunger\nprogram (European Commission, 2017). A country can\
    \ be considered food secure “if food is\navailable, accessible, nutritious and\
    \ stable across the other three dimensions” (Musa and\nBasir, 2021, p. 3087).\
    \ According to the latest FAO World Food and Agriculture – Statistical\nYearbook\
    \ (2022), in 2021, 770 million people were undernourished, with an increment of\
    \ 150\nmillion from 2020 (Wijerathna-Yapa and Pathirana, 2022). As a result, it\
    \ emerges a growing\nneed to modify agricultural methods and available technologies\
    \ so that “maximum crops can\nbe attained and human effort can be reduced” (Saad\
    \ et al., 2021).\nInnovation technology, digitalization and AI could, therefore,\
    \ represent some of the ways\nand strategies to mitigate the abovementioned issues,\
    \ achieve sustainability goals and\nmanage the climate change challenge (DiVaio\
    \ et al., 2020; Yela Ar\x01anega et al., 2022). For this\nreason, the topic of\
    \ AI applications in agriculture is worth investigating as an opportunity to\n\
    address some of the cited problems creating new business scenarios in the agricultural\
    \ sector\n(Amoussohoui et al., 2022). While the digital revolution has already\
    \ changed the world\n(Bresciani et al., 2018, 2021b), only in the last years the\
    \ agricultural sector has started to\nintegrate information and communication\
    \ technologies in traditional farming with the aim of\nimproving crop yield efficiency,\
    \ reducing costs and optimizing process inputs with the usage\nof data (Boursianis\
    \ et al., 2022).\nAI has proved its capability to lead to new business models\
    \ (Dal Mas et al., 2021; Wamba-\nTaguimdje et al., 2020). A business model can\
    \ be defined as “a modeling and representation\ntool [which] represents a dynamic\
    \ system, made of elements coherently in the relationship\nAI and\nagriculture\n\
    437\nbetween them. The business model is used to understand the logic of an organization\
    \ for the\nvalue creation” (Bagnoli et al., 2018, p. 56). Creating new business\
    \ models in agriculture could\nsupport the sector’s development, providing solutions\
    \ to the abovementioned issues, also\nunder a sustainability lens (Biancone et\
    \ al., 2022; Shukla and Sengupta, 2021).\nStarting from these premises, the article\
    \ aims to deepen the state-of-the-art of the\napplication of AI-related technologies\
    \ in agriculture, as depicted by the most recent literature.\nMore in detail,\
    \ the paper is intended to advance the knowledge about the possibility of leading\n\
    to new business models in the agricultural sector with the usage of AI as a disruptive\n\
    technology, highlighting the actual situation, the main benefits and barriers,\
    \ identifying new\navenues for research, practice and policy (Vaska et al., 2021).\
    \ Employing a review of the\ncurrent literature, the study seeks to examine the\
    \ following research questions (RQs).\nRQ1. What can be the contribution of AI\
    \ to the agricultural sector, especially in the\ncreation of new business models?\n\
    RQ2. What research implications emerge?\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section\
    \ 2 reports the methodological remarks in\nconducting the study. Section 3 summarizes\
    \ the main findings of the literature analysis.\nSection 4 discusses the main\
    \ results of the research questions in a critical way. Section 5\ndepicts the\
    \ limitations and future policy avenues.\n2. Methodology\n2.1 Selection criteria\n\
    The paper adopts a structured literature review (SLR) defined by Massaro et al.\
    \ (2016, p. 767)\nas “a method for studying a corpus of scholarly literature,\
    \ to develop insights, critical\nreflections, future research paths, and research\
    \ questions.” As recommended by the\nmethodological articles by Massaro et al.\
    \ (2016) and Kraus et al. (2020, 2022), the authors\nprepared a literature review\
    \ protocol to guide the analysis creating a framework to select,\nanalyze and\
    \ assess the academic production to ensure the study “to be reproducible, well-\n\
    evidenced, and transparent, resulting in a sample inclusive of all relevant and\
    \ appropriate\nstudies” (Kraus et al., 2022, p. 2579).\nIn accordance with previous\
    \ studies (Secinaro and Calandra, 2021), the scientific database\nScopus was employed\
    \ to find relevant contributions to be analyzed. The search key\n“Artificial intelligence\
    \ AND Agriculture AND Business model” in the title, abstract or\nkeywords, conducted\
    \ on September, 13th 2022, led to 73 total contributions [1]. As\nrecommended\
    \ by previous articles (Bresciani et al., 2021a), to cross-validate the results,\
    \ the\nsame search query was verified in the EBSCO Business Premier and Web of\
    \ Science (WoS)\ndatasets, leading to the same results.\nAs the initial number\
    \ of documents was not too extensive, the authors decided to keep all\nthe source\
    \ types to be assessed in more detail by reading the provided abstracts to ensure\n\
    eligibility. Interestingly enough, several published conference proceedings appeared\
    \ in the\ndocument list. Most literature reviews tend to exclude such sources,\
    \ as they are considered\nless rigorous than articles published in peer-reviewed\
    \ journals. Still, when considering\ncutting-edge research topics like the ones\
    \ connected to the development of modern\ntechnologies, early results may be shared\
    \ at conferences before being sent out for a more\nrigorous peer review journey.\
    \ Therefore, the authors decided to consider conference\nproceedings eligible\
    \ in the sample as they provide “insights into the areas of debate that will\n\
    later appear in academic journals” (Dumay et al., 2016, p. 168).\nAfter reading\
    \ all the abstracts, of those 73 journal papers, conference proceedings, books,\n\
    book chapters and editorials, 45 have been considered appropriate for the analysis,\
    \ while 28\nBFJ\n125,13\n438\nwere considered off-topic, as they did not deal\
    \ with the theme under a managerial or economic\nlens, rather an information technology\
    \ or computer science one. Of these 45 eligible works, 6\nof them were not retrieved,\
    \ while the other 39 were coded using the Nvivo software. During\nthe codification\
    \ process, two additional papers were excluded because they were off-topic\nafter\
    \ eligibility. The final sample of 37 works was considered appropriate, as very\
    \ close to the\ntarget of 40 articles which “indicates that the domain has reached\
    \ sufficient maturity for\nreview” (Paul et al., 2021, p. 4).\nThe following Figure\
    \ 1 reports the selection process following the PRISMA methodology\n(Page et al.,\
    \ 2021, Sch€unemann et al., 2021).\nFigure 1.\nThe process of article\nselection\
    \ following the\nPRISMA methodology\nAI and\nagriculture\n439\n2.2 Coding framework\n\
    In coding the items using Nvivo, several nodes were gathered from previous studies,\
    \ while\nothers were decided following an extensive discussion among the authors,\
    \ considering the\nspecific field of investigation.\nThe first node refers to\
    \ the type of authors dividing them among academics, practitioners\nand collaborations\
    \ (Dal Mas et al., 2020). The second node refers to the source type. The third\n\
    node maps the location where the study is conducted, grouping countries by continent\n\
    (Massaro et al., 2015). The fourth group of nodes refers to the employed research\
    \ method\n(Paoloni et al., 2021).The fifth node concerns the agricultural sector,\
    \ while the sixth category\nlists the problems to solve and the objectives to\
    \ reach. In this last node, the sub-nodes were\nadded while coding the papers,\
    \ employing an open coding approach. The seventh node\nanalyzes the technology\
    \ used and reported in the studies. The eighth node group maps the\napplication\
    \ in agriculture, while the ninth node focuses on identifying sources which treat\
    \ a\nbusiness model. The ninth node is about the eventual possibility of leading\
    \ a new business\nmodel. The tenth node analyzes the eventual connection with\
    \ sustainability issues. Last but\nnot least, the last nodes refer to the presence\
    \ of research, practice and policy implications.\n3. Results\nTable 1 reports\
    \ the bibliographic details of the 37 articles and conference proceedings which\n\
    were included in the literature review. While the earliest work dates back to\
    \ 2005, twenty-four\ncontributions (65% of the total sample) were published after\
    \ 2017, highlighting the increasing\ninterest in this topic in the last few years.\n\
    The following Table 2 underlines the results of the Nvivo coding, following the\
    \ defined\nframework.\nConcerning the node about authorship, authors are mainly\
    \ represented by academics with\ntwenty-five contributions. Interestingly, eight\
    \ works result from a collaboration between\nscholars and practitioners. Five\
    \ articles are authored by practitioners, mainly belonging to\ninstitutional agricultural\
    \ research centers.\nTwenty-one sources are represented by journal articles, while\
    \ sixteen are conference\npapers.\nConcerning the location of the study, twenty-four\
    \ sources specify the place where the\ninvestigation was conducted, while thirteen\
    \ papers have no specific area as they refer to\nspecific technological solutions\
    \ or algorithms. Considering the documents that do declare the\nlocation of their\
    \ investigation, eleven sources are focused on Asia and seven on America\n(including\
    \ both North and South America). Six references refer to Europe, while Africa\
    \ and\nOceania have respectively two papers for each continent. However, there\
    \ is not an absolute\npredominance. Therefore, it may be claimed that the sample\
    \ is well representative worldwide.\nWhen referring to the research methodology,\
    \ the vast majority of the sources (26 papers,\nequal to 70% of the total sample)\
    \ are represented by case studies, while the remaining eleven\npapers are literature\
    \ reviews. Still, the formers are mainly represented by theoretical\ninvestigations\
    \ which focus on a new technological application presentation and discussion.\n\
    Neither success (or failure) stories nor business translation experiences are\
    \ reported.\nFocusing on the agricultural sector, fifteen sources relate to the\
    \ cultivation of plants, while\nsome argue about the business in general terms.\
    \ Animal production is treated in six papers,\nwhile only one article discusses\
    \ fish farming. All in all, there seems to be good coverage of\ntopics, which\
    \ expresses the various interests both from general and specific research groups.\n\
    Regarding the specific issues and problems that stimulated the analysis, the goal\
    \ of a\nsignificant number of sources refers to increasing efficiency and maximizing\
    \ the farm return,\nwith twenty-six papers. The need to manage the environmental\
    \ impact and the external\nchanges are treated in twenty-four articles. Moreover,\
    \ nineteen papers discuss the issue of\nBFJ\n125,13\n440\n#\nAuthors\nTitle\n\

    \ example of this last issue. In the paper, the authors predict that climate change,\n\

    population in trouble due to the declined crop productivity. Only two articles\

    \ farm’s complexity may lead to an\nincrease in efficiency and profitability,\
    \ creating a sort of turbo effect. For instance,\nBogomolov et al. (2021) highlight\
    \ the connection between the need to improve yields with the\ndesertification\

    \ articles specifically refer to AI and Machine Learning. Other technologies with\n\
    great relevance that are reported in the articles are represented by Big Data\
    \ Analytics and the\ninternet of Things (IoT). Other less-discussed technologies\
    \ are represented by drones and\nrobots (eight papers), cloud computing (seven\
    \ articles), geographical indication systems and\nother technologies (six papers).\
    \ Finally, biotechnology, Blockchain and autonomous devices\nare named in three\
    \ pieces. Although the research has been based on AI as the leading\nkeyword,\
    \ the selected articles report several kinds of technologies, given their outstanding\n\
    level of integration and complementarity. DSS is the most used technology because\
    \ it\nrepresents the predecessor of AI. Within AI, we find all the sources which\
    \ discuss Machine\nLearning and all its specializations, such as Artificial Neural\
    \ Networks and Deep Learning.\nThe node about the applications in agriculture\
    \ allowed the investigation of the proposed\napplications in the agriculture field,\
    \ leading to four main results. The first and the most\ntreated is precision farming\
    \ and other types of agronomic applications discussed in twenty-\nfour papers.\
    \ Agronomic planning and economic applications are reported by twenty-one\nsources.\
    \ Less common applications are represented by water optimization with\nenvironmental\
    \ management and supply chain applications with traceability systems,\nwhich are\
    \ discussed respectively in fifteen and five papers. The following Figure 2 reports\
    \ the\nmain AI-based applications, dividing them into categories and naming those\
    \ which were cited\nby more than two articles.\nThere seems to be a link between\
    \ the applications and the problems to solve; the former\ntries to find feasible\
    \ solutions by employing innovative and practical ways. For instance,\nLi et al.\

    \ parameters in real-time, supporting farmers in managing farm complexity and\n\
    unpredictability. Furthermore, the proposed solution makes intelligent recommendations\
    \ for\nfertilization, crop disease detection and irrigation optimization. Another\
    \ example is\nrepresented by Skobelev et al. (2019), who offer several precision\
    \ farming solutions with\nthe objective of increasing productivity and efficiency\
    \ of crop production. Moreover, benefits\ninclude cost reductions along the chain\
    \ of production. The following Figure 3 shows the link\nbetween the problems to\
    \ be solved and the applications, underlining several connections.\nOne of the\
    \ critical points of the analysis was to understand the type of business models\n\
    reported by the articles as a consequence of the application of AI. Interestingly\
    \ enough,\ndespite mentioning the words “Business model” either in the title,\
    \ abstract and/or keywords,\nmost sources do not report any kind of business model.\
    \ Indeed, only seventeen papers\nresponded positively to this question. Among\
    \ such sources, the most discussed business\nmodel is surely represented by smart\
    \ farming with thirteen articles, followed by data-driven\nbusiness models with\
    \ eight papers and, finally, the general industry 4.0 business model with\nonly\
    \ two sources. However, findings are very connected to each other because both\
    \ data-\nFigure 2.\nThe main AI-based\napplications in\nagriculture\nAI and\n\
    agriculture\n449\ndriven and smart farming are part of the more inclusive industry\
    \ 4.0 business models, which\npermit enhancing the value proposition, solving\
    \ critical factors and delivering meaningful\nexperiences to customers (Bagnoli\
    \ et al., 2022; Pietrewicz, 2019).\nThe following node is connected to the previous\
    \ one, investigating the possibility of AI\nleading to a new business model. Again,\
    \ most articles do not mention any type of new\nbusiness model, with only six\
    \ papers trying to address such a challenge. Among these\narticles, two sources\
    \ propose a platform business model used for the food supply chain where\nthe\
    \ key participants of the agriculture industry can sell and offer their products\
    \ and services\nwith the use of smart contracts. Moreover, they can exchange data\
    \ by enriching a common\ndataset (Skobelev et al., 2019; Sood et al., 2022). The\
    \ same number of sources propose an\nAgritech 4.0 business model with an integrated\
    \ food supply chain, where the new\ntechnologies permit to integrate both food\
    \ production and food distribution, ensuring\ntransparency, traceability and customer\
    \ satisfaction (Eashwar and Chawla, 2021; Wolfert\net al., 2017). Finally, supply\
    \ chain management 5.0 and new information-based systems based\non traceability\
    \ are reported. The former proposes a new supply chain solution based on\ndriverless\
    \ autonomous vehicles for transporting and smart contracts with face recognition,\n\
    while the second treat a new system based on recommended guidelines and documentation\n\
    requirements for decision-making processes to ensure traceability along the chain\
    \ (Ahamed\nand Vignesh, 2022; Li et al., 2017a). However, an interesting consideration\
    \ is that all four new\nFigure 3.\nThe link between\nproblems and\napplications\n\
    BFJ\n125,13\n450\nsolutions are inherent to the food supply chain and to the need\
    \ to reduce complexity through\ntechnology integration. These efforts are also\
    \ addressed to reduce global food waste along\nthe food chain, which, according\
    \ to a 2011 FAO report, equals one-third of the global\nproduction (UN Environment\
    \ Programme, 2021).\nAnother point of analysis referred to a potential connection\
    \ with sustainability issues.\nInterestingly, most articles discuss sustainability\
    \ issues, with only fourteen pieces not\nconsidering environmental or social topics.\
    \ Five different kinds of sustainability issues can be\nreported. The first and\
    \ the most treated is the use of fertilizers, nitrates and heavy metals,\nwhich\
    \ pollute agricultural soil and water (eight references, equal to 35% of the total\
    \ sample)\nand after the need to reduce the use and waste of water in the agricultural\
    \ sector. The other\ntopics are related to the need to produce climate-oriented\
    \ and ecologically friendly\napplications, the need to achieve the food-security\
    \ in a sustainable way and the need to make\nsustainable the production of some\
    \ types of foods which actually heavily impact the\nenvironment.\nConcerning the\
    \ advantages gathered from the application of AI, almost all the sources (34\n\
    papers equal to 92% of the total sample) explain the benefits of the new technology\n\
    implementations in the agricultural sectors. The most discussed advantages are\
    \ represented\nby the organizational advantages and the decision-making support.\
    \ Other advantages are\nrelated to the efficiency benefits and the productivity\
    \ increase, while only two pieces for each\npro speak about environmental benefits\
    \ and food-safety issues with the possibility to control\nfood compliance easily.\n\
    Another node concerns the disadvantages. Interestingly enough, just seven articles\n\
    discuss the cons, with the majority of the sources not discussing such issues.\
    \ Some examples\nare represented by the inevitable loss of income related to the\
    \ compliance with water\nrestrictions for small vineyards farms or the fact that\
    \ some irrigation decision-making\nsystems are crop specific for a given area\
    \ with a consequent great complexity to generalize\nthe methods for other crops\
    \ and areas (Carmona et al., 2011; Nada et al., 2014).\nAbout the barriers that\
    \ can limit the spreading of new technology, only fourteen papers\ndiscuss innovation\
    \ barriers. The two most significant ones are the farmers’ lack of technical\n\
    knowledge about information and communication technologies (ICT) and emerging\n\
    technologies and the limited equipment, Internet access, storage capacity and\
    \ high-quality\ndata, especially in developing countries. Bogomolov et al. (2021),\
    \ for instance, highlight the\nlack of qualified personnel and high-quality Internet\
    \ access as two of the main problems in the\nfield of applied digital technologies\
    \ in the Russian agricultural industry, which hinder\nproductivity and efficiency\
    \ improvement. Six papers deal with the high investment cost and\nlow perceived\
    \ effectiveness. From such a perspective, Wakjira et al. (2021) analyze a case\
    \ of\nprecision beekeeping in Indonesia and Ethiopia, highlighting the impossibility\
    \ of using\ncommercial systems of remote bee colony monitoring because local beekeepers\
    \ cannot afford\nthem. Finally, some sources treat the mismatch between farmers’\
    \ practical needs and the\navailable applications, data control and data security\
    \ problem, the lack of integration of the\nfood supply chain, the large energy\
    \ consumption of these innovations and the user\npsychological barriers to the\
    \ implementation.\nConcerning the research implications, only sixteen papers report\
    \ any, ten concerning the\nneed to extend and integrate the study with new data\
    \ types or focus on new related issues.\nThe remaining sources advocate testing\
    \ the proposed method, analyzing profoundly new\naspects and finally explaining\
    \ the need to develop new solutions and technologies.\nConcerning the practical\
    \ implications, twenty-six sources lead to some practical\nconsequences, especially\
    \ for farmers. Such a topic appears to merge theoretical insights\nand practical\
    \ applications, and it welcomes practical user solutions. Themes include the\n\
    potential to help farmers in the decision-making process, support everyday farming\n\
    operations, and to increase efficiency and effectiveness. No surprise AI is historically\
    \ strictly\nAI and\nagriculture\n451\nconnected to decision-making support, with\
    \ a substantial increase in the last years as a\nconsequence of the availability\
    \ of new data sources and the decreasing cost of technological\ntools (Secinaro\
    \ et al., 2022). AI is able to make the needed changes in the decision-making\n\
    process supporting new ways to identify the critical variables of the decision\
    \ space, the\ninterpretation of the process, the final result and the several\
    \ alternatives with the possibility\nto replicate the transaction, reducing time\
    \ and costs (Shrestha et al., 2019). Another significant\npractical implication\
    \ concerns the possibility of helping farmers manage the implicit farm\nunpredictability\
    \ in the planning process. Finally, some sources provide farmers with new\nemerging\
    \ and integrated technologies to develop and test.\nLast but not least, only nine\
    \ papers report some policy implications, mainly represented\nby government involvement.\
    \ Four articles explain as governments should use agricultural\ndata from fields\
    \ to improve policy-making decisions, learning from data to create better\nfuture\
    \ forecasts. At the same time, four sources recommend governments subscribe to\
    \ new\ninvestment plans to enhance the technological transition, for instance,\
    \ in publicly accessible\ndigital infrastructures, protecting platform workers’\
    \ rights and customer privacy (Chiles\net al., 2021). Other contributions encourage\
    \ policymakers to support farmers in technology\nknowledge acquisition by creating\
    \ advisory units composed of experts (Sood et al., 2022), and\nto support social\
    \ innovation by engaging the younger generations (Wakjira et al., 2021).\n4. Discussion\n\
    As already explained in the introduction, this study aims to examine and better\
    \ understand\nthe role of AI in the agricultural sector, focusing on the possibility\
    \ of AI creating new business\nmodels and understanding the research implications.\n\
    4.1 State-of-the-art and new applications of AI in the agricultural field\nIn\
    \ addressing the first research question, results depict a lively situation characterized\
    \ by a\nhigh speed of change and development. In such a perspective, findings\
    \ report many\ncollaborations and the presence of papers authored by practitioners,\
    \ which looks unusual in\nacademia, where the academic-practitioner divide exists\
    \ in many fields (Massaro et al., 2018).\nSuch a finding suggests that this topic\
    \ represents an advanced and high-technical field where\ntheory is strictly connected\
    \ to practical applications. Innovation happens first in practice and\ncan lead\
    \ then to academic works and reasoning. Therefore, the practitioners’ role in\
    \ the field is\nextremely important. Academics are so invited to partner with\
    \ managers and private\ncompanies to study the advancements and innovations in\
    \ the field, share the best practices\nand business cases and suggest methodologies\
    \ to assess the technology, measure and report\nits impacts, suggesting practical,\
    \ research and policy implications.\nMoreover, the unusually high number of conference\
    \ proceedings extracted from Scopus\nand included in the sample can be connected\
    \ with the previous point concerning the role of\npractitioners. Indeed, when\
    \ high-technological fields are under the academic lens, scholars\ntend to present\
    \ an early-stage draft of their works at conferences, getting feedback from their\n\
    fellows before submitting their articles for peer review. In the case of AI, it\
    \ seems like the\nimplementation of new technologies and new agricultural innovations\
    \ are initially presented\nduring conferences and only after being discussed in\
    \ the academic literature. Conferences,\ncongresses and professional and institutional\
    \ meetings then become relevant places where\nthe latest advances are presented,\
    \ shared and discussed.\nRegarding the types of technology, although the research\
    \ key used in Scopus specifically\nmentioned the words “Artificial Intelligence,”\
    \ twelve different kinds of technologies are\nreported. This fact may be explained\
    \ as AI is only a part of a greater system of Industry 4.0\ndigital paradigms\
    \ used as methods to develop analysis and prediction with further\nBFJ\n125,13\n\
    452\ndisciplines such as data science, electronic engineering and so on. For this\
    \ reason, AI is a\ntechnology that may be fully integrated with other digital\
    \ paradigms such as smart\nmanufacturing, autonomous and collaborative robots,\
    \ augmented and virtual reality,\nindustrial IoT, cloud computing, big data analytics\
    \ and cybersecurity, permitting to reach\neconomies of scale with high levels\
    \ of personalization. A complementarity among\ntechnologies emerges. Notably,\
    \ particularly significant seems the relationship between AI\nand IoT, merged\
    \ by Li et al. (2022) in the new term “AIOT.”\nAs already reported in the results,\
    \ a relevant number of practical implications are related\nto decision-making\
    \ support provided by these new technological implementations. At this\npoint,\
    \ the farmers’ capacity to use these innovations in the right way looks fundamental.\n\
    About the practical application in agriculture, precision farming emerges as a\
    \ new method to\nincrease efficiency and reduce losses. Precision agriculture\
    \ could be defined as a new method\nof smart agriculture which permits connecting\
    \ resources with needs, growing, in this way,\nefficiency and productivity while\
    \ also reducing the environmental impact and the\nunpredictability of the farm\
    \ return (Boursianis et al., 2022).\n4.2 Research methods\nAlso the research methods\
    \ second the academic-practitioner alliance in this field. Indeed, the\nresearch\
    \ methods adopted underline how case studies play a vital role in the literature.\
    \ Most of\nthesecasesdonot“tell”thesuccessorfailurestoriesofcompaniesorfarmers.Still,theyassessand\n\
    discuss new innovations and their practical applications, still with little emphasis\
    \ on the\nconsequences for the business, the technology acceptance and ethics\
    \ dynamics and the need to\nengageinnew educationalpathstogainnew competenciesandskills.\
    \ Thatisalsowhymostcases\ndo not refer to any specific geographical location,\
    \ as new applications may be employed\neverywhere. Even if such a development\
    \ may sound “natural” considering the field and the speed\nof change, the scientific\
    \ community belonging to the management, organization and accounting\nfields should\
    \ contribute to the multidisciplinary debate by sharing more success stories,\
    \ even\ncomparing multiple cases, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of some solutions. In\naddition, anotherkeyissuemay berepresented bytherateofacceptanceofthesenew\
    \ applications\nin practice. Therefore, quantitative research methods like surveys\
    \ and questionnaires should be\ntested by agricultural operators, who directly\
    \ use the technological application during their\neveryday operations, or Delphi\
    \ panels to assess the potential of some new solutions, even in their\nearly stage\
    \ of development. Researchers should target small and medium farmers, who represent\n\
    the majority of agricultural enterprises in several continents, but who often\
    \ have little capital to\ninvest and a lower level oftechnological knowledge.\
    \ The latter is indeed reported in the barriers as\none of the most significant\
    \ hurdles to digital transactions. For this reason, trade associations and\nagricultural\
    \ consortia may organize open recurring conferences to diffuse and disseminate\
    \ the\nopportunities brought forth by AI and Industry 4.0 to all the operators\
    \ in this field.\n4.3 Geographical areas\nAnother interesting result comes from\
    \ the locations where the studies were conducted. The\ntopic is widely diffused\
    \ around the world, with a concentration in Asia, which is actually the\nhub of\
    \ global innovation. Asian countries are implementing several policies to support\n\
    innovation, start-ups and the creation of business incubators (GT staff reporters,\
    \ 2023). From\nthe yet limited sample, Europe is actually even behind the USA\
    \ and South America.\nFurthermore, while Africa appears in the sample with just\
    \ a few contributions, it may represent\nan exciting outlet for technology providers,\
    \ given its significant presence of arable land and the\nactual low level of technological\
    \ advancement. While more barriers may be present than\nelsewhere (especially\
    \ concerning the lack of infostructure and the financial investments\nneeded),\
    \ Africa stands as a continent whose development may largely benefit from AI.\n\
    AI and\nagriculture\n453\n4.4 Business model innovation\nIn addressing the business\
    \ model topic, interesting thoughts should be made. Even the\npapers that somehow\
    \ mention the matter do not clearly explain the business model name.\nInterestingly,\
    \ there is a lack of business model definition in all these papers. Still, new\n\
    technologies are supposed to be the triggers of new business models with technology-\n\
    driven innovation (Biancone et al., 2022; Bresciani et al., 2021a; Secinaro et\
    \ al., 2022).\nThe discouraging results open up exciting research avenues in mapping\
    \ and defining\nnew business models in the agricultural field, their unique features,\
    \ the\nopportunities they may bring, the outcomes, the operational consequences\
    \ and needs\nand the chance to involve different stakeholders with relevant implications\
    \ for business\npractices as well. Researchers may borrow some sound results and\
    \ experiences scouted\nin other fields.\n4.5 Connection to sustainability issues\n\
    Although the research did not mean to focus on the sustainability issue in agriculture,\n\
    findings show that the two topics are highly related. Farmers should take into\
    \ consideration\nthe environmental impact of their activity. Moreover, there is\
    \ an influence of the\nenvironmental variables on the seasonal outcome, which\
    \ determines the farm profit. This\nis intrinsically at the core of farm management,\
    \ but now, with digital technology support, it is\npossible to manage farm unpredictably.\
    \ A new innovative paradigm is given by vertical\nfarming, a new way of production\
    \ which permit to control all the agricultural variables using\nthe so-called\
    \ Controlled Environmental Agriculture together with the nature co-design,\nincreasing\
    \ resilience and circularity through hydroponic cultivation and advanced led\n\
    lighting systems (VanGerrewey et al., 2022) AI can create new sustainable business\
    \ models\nimproving the technical-scientific quality of the production system.\
    \ For this reason, a focus\nshould be placed on applications which provide both\
    \ profit and sustainability (DiVaio et al.,\n2020), also leading to new sustainable\
    \ business models for value creation.\nStarting from the analysis of the results,\
    \ the following Table 4 summarizes the new\nresearch avenues for each of the identified\
    \ macro-topics.\n5. Conclusions\nThe article underlines the potential role of\
    \ multiple AI solutions in disrupting the agricultural\nsector by offering sound\
    \ opportunities to farmers and entrepreneurs in the field to support\ntheir decision-making\
    \ process and increase the farm’s profitability. Still, literature and\npractice\
    \ are in progress, with more solutions and applications being developed and tested\
    \ and\nmore opportunities to disrupt business models, even fostering sustainability\
    \ practices.\nAcademic engagement with professionals stands as a relevant strategy\
    \ to stimulate the\ndebate, study the managerial and organizational dynamics and\
    \ suggest and spread new\nbusiness procedures.\nSeveral new research avenues have,\
    \ therefore, been suggested: from the employment of\nboth quantitative and qualitative\
    \ research methodologies to a deeper collaboration with\npractitioners, from spreading\
    \ best practices and lessons learned to comparative studies\namong different contexts\
    \ and countries. Promising research themes include the features of\npotential\
    \ new business models, the degree of technology acceptance up to the educational\n\
    needs of farmers and communities, among others.\n5.1 Limitations\nAs with all\
    \ studies, this has limitations. Even if the methodology can be considered rigorous\n\
    and replicable, the sample of analyzed sources is small, with the use and cross-checking\
    \ of a\nBFJ\n125,13\n454\nlimited number of scientific datasets. In addition,\
    \ the coding process may leave room for\nsubjectivity. Moreover, the speed of\
    \ technology development and the quantity of new academic\npieces published every\
    \ month may impact the validity of the results. Such limitations may lead\nto\
    \ further research opportunities to frame the phenomenon and its fascinating yet\
    \ helpful\noutcomes, also scouting the so-called “grey literature” coming from\
    \ governmental institutions,\nconsultancy firms, patent datasets, professional\
    \ magazines and reviews and recognized\npractice blogs, as reported by other studies\
    \ (Dal Mas et al., 2023; Secinaro et al., 2022).\n5.2 Policy implications\nWhile\
    \ practice implications are more connected to technological advances and the application\n\
    of new business models, some relevant policy implications emerge.\nPolicies may\
    \ be linked to the identified barriers in the practical applications of these\
    \ new\nAI-based solutions. These barriers include the lack of farmers’ ICT knowledge\
    \ and\ntechnology acceptance dynamics. Findings explain how these barriers in\
    \ some cases are\nMacro topic\nResearch implications\nState-of-the-art and new\

    \ specific, such as in the case of the complexity and lack of integration of the\
    \ food\nsupply chain, but the majority are represented by general barriers to\
    \ the implementation,\nwhich are common to all other sectors. As already suggested,\
    \ the agricultural field could\nborrow or adapt solutions created and already\
    \ implemented for other sectors solving a\nsignificant number of problems. For\
    \ this reason, policymakers should stimulate the\ncollaboration between key agricultural\
    \ stakeholders and actors involved in different sectors,\nto solve the general\
    \ barriers to the implementation. Governments play a vital role in fostering\n\
    the creation of new general solutions and the adaptation of existing systems,\
    \ including the\navailability of dedicated funds or tax privileges to support\
    \ farmers (especially small-sized\ncompanies) in technology acquisition. Knowledge\
    \ translation and dissemination initiatives\ninvolving multiple stakeholders like\
    \ agricultural consortia, technology providers, research\ninstitutes and universities\
    \ could help to overcome the acceptance issues and the\nunderstanding of the new\
    \ opportunities for the single farm and the more comprehensive\necosystem.\nNote\n\

  limitations: The study focuses primarily on the technical aspects of data collection
    and processing in AI-based agricultural applications. It could benefit from a
    broader discussion of the organizational and social challenges associated with
    data management and the adoption of AI technologies in the agricultural sector.
    Additionally, it could explore the ethical implications of data collection and
    use in agriculture, particularly regarding data privacy and ownership.

  analysis: 'The paper presents an automatic irrigation management model using a combination
    of weather parameters and soil moisture measurements to determine the water balance
    required for a crop at each condition during its growing phase. The model is powered
    by a variety of technologies like deep learning to classify clouds responsible
    for rain, machine learning models to predict rainfall based on atmospheric parameters
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) using different sensors to collect data from
    the field. The key insights from the paper are as follows:


    1. The system can operate autonomously without human intervention and can be used
    by farmers in remote locations who may not have access to the internet or Wi-Fi.


    2. The system uses a combination of sensors and machine learning models to collect
    and analyze data on soil moisture, atmospheric conditions, and cloud cover to
    predict rainfall and adjust irrigation schedules accordingly.


    3. The system has been tested in real-world conditions and has been shown to be
    effective in reducing water usage and improving crop yields.


    The paper does not have any major limitations for fully addressing the point and
    outline, as it provides a comprehensive description of the proposed system and
    its benefits. However, it is important to note that the system has only been tested
    in a limited number of locations and may not be suitable for all types of crops
    or climates. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to automatic irrigation
    management that has the potential to improve water use efficiency and crop yields.'

    \ and the Internet of Things (IoT) \nusing different sensors to collect data from\
    \ the field. This algorithm is very appropriate for \nfarmers who are in remote\
    \ locations and are not able to use the internet and WIFI due to its \nunavailability.\
    \ The device will be attached to the motor, will take the data from sensors and\
    \ \nwill do the rain prediction at device level only and will switch ON/OFF the\
    \ motor based on \nthe soil moisture value and rain prediction without any human\
    \ intervention.   \n \nIntroduction \n \nWater is the most significant resource\
    \ for each and every living thing and is used \nlargely for the agriculture sector.\
    \ Agriculture uses around 70% of the world's surface \nwater in irrigating the\
    \ land to produce crops. Agriculture, which is the sole source of \nhuman food,\
    \ is the world's main industry and major land use, accounting for 40% of \nall\
    \ available land. Agriculture has a crucial role in a country's economic \ndevelopment\
    \ Sah et al. (2018). Furthermore, crop-based food products provide for \n78 percent\
    \ of global average per capita energy demands, while other food sources \nsuch\
    \ as eggs, milk, and meat account for the remaining 20% Brevik, Eric (2013). As\
    \ \na result, the\n95 \n \nessential necessity is to meet the dietary demands\
    \ of a growing population, which \ncan only be met by increasing agricultural\
    \ productivity. Agriculture and its related \nsectors provide 17 percent of India's\
    \ gross domestic product, according to the \nMinistry of Statistics and Program\
    \ Implementation (GDP, for the years 2009 and \n2017). Furthermore, it employs\
    \ almost two-thirds of India's workforce Deshpande \n(2017). In India, agriculture\
    \ provides the prime source of income for more than 58 \npercent of rural households,\
    \ Figure 1 depicts these agricultural dimensions. As a \nresult, progress in the\
    \ agriculture division is directly linked to the creation of jobs and \nthe reduction\
    \ of poverty in developing nations Srivastava et al. (2016). Monitoring \nagricultural\
    \ activities is the most required necessity of today for minimizing human \nintervention\
    \ in the field because of the scarcity of labour and urbanization. Demand \nfor\
    \ food is rising on daily basis and meeting it with traditional agricultural practices\
    \ is \nbecoming increasingly difficult. Agriculture monitoring is a top priority\
    \ because it \nhelps to reduce labour costs while increasing output which requires\
    \ to adopt new \ntechnologies and modern practices. \n \n \nFigure 1:  Importance\
    \ of the agricultural sector for India \n \nVarious monitoring activities in the\
    \ field of agriculture have been carried out using \nArtificial Intelligence,\
    \ such as soil monitoring based on soil conditions to encourage \nmulti-cropping\
    \ by forming zones based on similar properties of soil and to help \nfarmers in\
    \ taking decisions on the usage of various resources like fertilizers, water,\
    \ \npesticides based on early disease prediction in the correct amount and at\
    \ right time. \nToday, technology is spreading its wings in every sector, including\
    \ agriculture so \nour farmers must be educated and should be motivated to integrate\
    \ and make use \nof technology as much as possible to increase crop yield by reducing\
    \ the adverse \nimpact of traditional practices on the environment. Deep learning\
    \ offers a vast range \nof applications, and its use in industry has advanced\
    \ dramatically. Deep learning \nhas a distinct benefit over machine learning in\
    \ that it provides depth to the latter. \nMachine learning paradigm developments\
    \ are breaking down barriers to required \ndata analyses in many IoT-based applications.\
    \ Deep learning models have \ndemonstrated outstanding results in a variety of\
    \ fields, including speech recognition, \nnatural language processing, image recognition,\
    \ information retrieval, indoor \nlocalization, physiological and psychological\
    \ state detection, and so on, and these \nservices serve as the foundation for\
    \ IoT applications Mohammadi et al. (2018). \n96 \n \nWireless Sensor Networks\
    \ (WSN) and Precision Agriculture (PA) applications bring \ntogether an exciting\
    \ new area of research that will considerably increase agricultural \nproduction\
    \ quality, precision irrigation, and cost savings. In addition, the ease of \n\
    deployment, system maintenance, and monitoring paves the path for WSN systems\
    \ \nto be accepted in PA. Implementation cost can be reduced and so make WSN a\
    \ \nmore appealing solution for all kinds of fields and cultivations using the\
    \ optimized \nmethodologies in selecting the appropriate sensor architecture.\
    \ Internet of Things \n(IoT) has proven to be useful in real-time data monitoring\
    \ and can benefit farmers \nthrough a variety of important approaches by selecting\
    \ the crops according to the \nsoil, amount, and time of fertilization at a particular\
    \ location for a particular crop, \nweed detection etc. that can help them grow\
    \ better crops and manage their fields \nmore effectively. As food is the most\
    \ basic need of any human being, this ultimately \naids in the country's general\
    \ growth.  \n \nNeed for Precision Agriculture in India \n \nAlarming obstacles\
    \ to the global food system include global warming, resource \ndepletion, surging\
    \ food demand, and growing labour prices. However, the difficulties \nare greater\
    \ and more numerous in India, including small and dispersed land \nholdings, declining\
    \ productivity, depleting natural resources, seasonal production, \nclimatic fluctuations,\
    \ lack of an eco-regional approach and stagnant farm incomes. \nA time like these\
    \ calls for the best possible use of scarce resources, which is where \nnewly\
    \ developed precision farming technologies can help enhance agricultural \noutput\
    \ and profitability. \nWith the massive challenges of biotic and abiotic pressures\
    \ experienced by crops \nand the enormous need for food grain of 480 million tons\
    \ (Mt) by the year 2050, the \nintroduction and acceptance of contemporary technologies\
    \ in Indian agriculture is \nunavoidable. \n \nDrawbacks of Precision Agriculture\
    \ \n● High cost: Farmers may be discouraged from using this farming practice by\
    \ high \ncapital expenditures. \n● Lack of technical expertise knowledge and technology:\
    \ Before being used, pre-\ncision agriculture techniques still need professional\
    \ advice as they are in the initial \nstages of development. \n● Not applicable\
    \ or difficult/costly for small landholdings: Before the system has \ncollected\
    \ enough data to be completely implemented, it may take several years for \nsmall\
    \ landholdings. It is a really challenging undertaking, especially the data collect-\n\
    ing and analysis. \n● Heterogeneity of cropping systems and market imperfections\
    \ \nBenefits of Precision Farming for Indian Agriculture \n● In India, improving\
    \ and expanding the use of precision agriculture technologies can \naid in lowering\
    \ production costs, raising productivity, and more effectively utilizing \nnatural\
    \ resources.\n97 \n \n● By enhancing productivity, crop quality, sustainability,\
    \ profitability, environmental \nprotection, on-farm quality of life, food safety,\
    \ and rural economic development, it \nhas the potential to revolutionize modern\
    \ farm management in India. \n● Site-specific uses of irrigation, herbicides,\
    \ and fertilizers in cotton fields, oil palm \nplantations in South India, and\
    \ coffee and tea gardens in Eastern India can signifi-\ncantly lower production\
    \ costs and chemical pollution in the environment. \n● When there are not enough\
    \ water resources, it can improve irrigation efficiency. \n● Farmers can use forecasting\
    \ to control issues like pests, illnesses, nutritional defi-\nciencies, and plant\
    \ diseases. \n● Furthermore, it increases the sector's opportunities for skilled\
    \ employment and intro-\nduces new techniques for assessing multifunctional factors\
    \ such as non-market \nfunctions. \n● It plays a crucial part in keeping track\
    \ of greenhouse conditions in farming areas. \n \nPolicy Approach to Promote Precision\
    \ Farming at Farm Level \n● Determine the markets where crop-specific precision\
    \ farming can be most effec-\ntively promoted. \n● forming multidisciplinary teams\
    \ of agricultural scientists from various fields, engi-\nneers, manufacturers,\
    \ and economics to research the whole use of precision agri-\nculture \n● Give\
    \ the farmers full technological support so they may create prototypes or models\
    \ \nthat can be copied on a wide scale. \n● Farmers' fields should be the subject\
    \ of a pilot study to demonstrate the effective-\nness of precision agriculture.\
    \ \n● educating farmers on the effects of using unbalanced levels of agricultural\
    \ inputs \nsuch as irrigation, fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides \n \n\
    State of Precision Farming in India Compared to rest of the world \n● Although\
    \ precision farming is thought to have originated in the US, it has since \nspread\
    \ throughout the world due to its advantages in terms of lower costs and in-\n\
    creased productivity.  \n● European countries like the UK, Germany, France, and\
    \ the Netherlands have \nadopted precision agriculture to maximize the use of\
    \ fertilizer and pesticides and \nboost output.  \n● This trend has been further\
    \ fuelled by environmental concerns. Countries like Can-\nada, Australia, Argentina,\
    \ and Brazil are putting precision farming principles into re-\nality due to the\
    \ necessity for a sustainable farming system.  \n● Asia, China, and India are\
    \ among the nations experimenting with precision farming \ndue to their growing\
    \ populations, limited landholdings, and rising labour expenses\n98 \n \n \n●\
    \ Even though this technology has the potential to be successful, it is still\
    \ in its infancy \nin India. To get this idea out to Indian farmers, organizations\
    \ like Trimble, Tata \nKisan Kendra (TKK), and Fasal, among many others, are working.\
    \ TKK, a project     \nstarted by Tata Chemicals Limited (TCL), aims to move rural\
    \ India away from anti-\nquated farming methods and toward the satellite and IT\
    \ era. The TKKs deliver \nTCL's extension services to farmers, employing remote\
    \ sensing to evaluate soil \nconditions, look at crop health, look for insect\
    \ infestations, and predict crop yield. \nThey help farmers quickly adjust to\
    \ changing conditions, which increases crop yield \nand increases farmers' income.\
    \ \n \n● Precision farming is being aggressively implemented by the Tamil Nadu\
    \ Precision \nFarming Project to cover a bigger geographic region.  \n● Despite\
    \ initial hostility from the farmers, its programs for drip irrigation and crop\
    \ pro-\nduction have received widespread acceptance (Mandal 2009) \n● The Central\
    \ Potato Research Station's (CPRS) investigation of the role of remote \nsensing\
    \ in mapping the variability with regard to place and time (Shanwad 2004) will\
    \ \naid in the local farming of potatoes. \n● The Dindigul area of Tamil Nadu\
    \ has been chosen by the M S Swaminathan Re-\nsearch Foundation in cooperation\
    \ with NABARD for the experimentation of Variable \nRate Input Application (Shanwad\
    \ 2004). \n● Precision farming methods are being tested at the institution farm\
    \ of the Indian Agri-\nculture Research Institution. \n● Variable Input Application\
    \ in Different Cropping Systems has been started by Pro-\nject Directorate for\
    \ Cropping Systems Research (PDCSR), Modipuram and Meerut \n(UP), in Collaboration\
    \ with Central Institute of Agriculture Engineering (CIAE), Bho-\npal. \n \nChallenges\
    \ in Adopting Precision Agriculture in India \n \n●  Due to its distinct pattern\
    \ of land ownership, \n●  inadequate infrastructure, \n●  lack of farmers' willingness\
    \ to take on the risk, \n●  social and economic circumstances, and demographic\
    \ circumstances, the adoption \nof precision farming in India is still in its\
    \ infancy. \n \nMost of the Indian agriculture is carried out on small parcels\
    \ of land, which restricts \nthe economic benefits of precision farming equipment\
    \ that is already in use and \ntherefore, the farmers of developing nations like\
    \ India, Brazil, and China rely on \ntraditional farming rather than tech-driven\
    \ farming practices. \nFor the Indian agricultural industry, the successful development\
    \ and wide-scale \napplication of precision agricultural technologies is still\
    \ a long way off. Such smart \nfarming concepts would enable the Indian agro-industry\
    \ to undergo a transformation \nthanks to the nation's expanding IT sector and\
    \ extensive research in the agriculture \nsector.\n99 \n \nThe need for automation\
    \ in the agricultural sector is very essential, and there are \nnumerous ways\
    \ to put it into practice. Irrigation is the first area where automation is \n\
    required for efficient water use. The soil moisture sensor monitors the moisture\
    \ level \nof the soil and begins watering the farm when the value falls below\
    \ the farmer's \nchosen threshold based on the type of crop and its age. The embedded\
    \  system \nand the Internet of Things have aided in the development of a small\
    \ system that \nmonitors the farm's water level without the need for human intervention.\
    \ The \nInternet of Things is mostly used in intelligent watering systems. As\
    \ efficient use of \nexisting fresh water is critical, and the water problem can\
    \ be resolved with \nadvancements in technology and the application of automation\
    \ Ahmed et al. (2021). \n \nNovelty: A rainfall prediction device prototype is\
    \ introduced which is integrated with \ncommon and affordable sensors to sense\
    \ atmospheric parameters and with a USB \ncamera to capture sky images on a raspberry\
    \ Pi where a rain prediction model \nbased on a machine learning model that take\
    \ input temperature, pressure and \nrelative humidity as input and Deep learning\
    \ model that works on cloud images to \npredict rainfall. Edge analytics is used\
    \ to avoid the use of WIFI or the internet so the \nprediction of rainfall based\
    \ on both models is given at the device level itself where \nthe input parameters\
    \ are sensed. The novelty of the device is that it can be used in \nmany decision-making\
    \ activities where rainfall plays a major role. It is used for \nnowcasting without\
    \ the help of any internet or WiFi. 5V of power is required to \nswitch on the\
    \ device and is portable.  \n \nPrecision irrigation is a critical step toward\
    \ achieving food productivity and security \nwhile simultaneously implementing\
    \ water-preserving techniques to overcome the \nunpredictable nature of rainfall\
    \ and the impact of a water shortage caused by \nphenomena like drought in various\
    \ regions of the world. The aim of Precision \nirrigation scheduling is to provide\
    \ the proper amount of water to each plant at the \nright time to overcome the\
    \ water loss caused by a process such as soil erosion, \ndeep percolation, or\
    \ evapotranspiration while avoiding excess- and insufficient \nirrigation, Benyezza\
    \ et al. (2018), Devanand Kumar et al. (2020), Bigah et al. \n(2019), Gu et al.\
    \ (2020). Irrigation Management is a key process in saving water \nconsumption\
    \ and other indirect expenditures occurred from other sources of energy \nlike\
    \ electricity or fossil fuel for operating pumps with good irrigation management\
    \ \nthrough proper monitoring for optimal cost-effectiveness Togneri et al. (2019),\
    \ \nCáceres et al. (2021). The use of artificial neural networks for an estimate\
    \ and \nmodelling the non-linear characteristics of reference evapotranspiration\
    \ has been \nproposed and explained by Sharma et al. (2016), Kelley et al. (2019),\
    \ in addition to \nthe importance of precise evapotranspiration estimation in\
    \ aiding precision irrigation \nmanagement. This approach uses parameters like\
    \ temperature, humidity, wind \nspeed, and solar radiation and was able to accurately\
    \ estimate water requirements \nfor the crop that may be used to take appropriate\
    \ irrigation decisions. Penchalaiah \net al. (2021) created an IoT-based data-driven\
    \ irrigation system where soil moisture \nis predicted using this method, and\
    \ the results are compared to predictions from \nother models. The new method\
    \ is proven to be more effective, and the soil moisture \ncontent shown is promising.\
    \ Bhoi et al. (2021) present an irrigation recommendation \nthat incorporates\
    \ machine learning methods like regression tree and Support Vector \nMachine,\
    \ as well as agglomerative clustering. The system recommended performed \nadmirably\
    \ on both its own gathered data set and the accessible crop data collection. \n\
    Risheh et al. (2020) using artificial neural networks and an IoT architecture,\
    \ created \na dependable system for greenhouse irrigation and demonstrate the\
    \ superior \n100 \n \nperformance of neural networks compared to the current alternative\
    \ method of \nsupport vector regression using a dataset gathered by conducting\
    \ tests on various \nsoils also used transfer learning technique to reduce the\
    \ processing power and   \nspeed up the training. Mehra et al. (2020) proposed\
    \ an intelligent IoT-based \nhydroponic system using Deep Neural Networks. A prototype\
    \ for  Tomato plant \ngrowth as a case study was developed using Arduino, Raspberry\
    \ Pi3 and Tensor \nFlow based on the numerous input parameters obtained, the system\
    \ as created is \nsophisticated enough to provide the proper control action for\
    \ the hydroponic \nenvironment. In order to achieve irrigation optimization with\
    \ weather and soil \nconditions as key components, Difallah et al. (2017) created\
    \ a linear programming \nmodel combined with a knapsack decisional form. The findings\
    \ showed a reduction \nin water use of 28.5%. Better optimization would emerge\
    \ from taking into account \nadditional important extrinsic elements such as relative\
    \ humidity, soil nutrients, wind \nspeed, and sunshine length. In Alibabaei et\
    \ al. (2021) the ANN controller is used to \ncalculate the error by comparing\
    \ the target soil moisture content to the actual soil \nmoisture content, and\
    \ based on that calculation, the valves were opened and \nclosed. An Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensor network (WSN) \narchitecture was created\
    \ by Kamaruddin et al. (2019) and it monitors and manages \nthe irrigation system\
    \ either manually or automatically. The communication network \ntransceiver and\
    \ CPU used in the suggested manner were NRF24L01 and will be \nused to transmit\
    \ the soil moisture sensor data to the base station. The data from the \nsensor\
    \ node will then be transmitted via the base station to the cloud server. For\
    \ the \npurpose of connecting to an Android application and storing all the data\
    \ in a \ndatabase, this project used Thing speak as a cloud server., Kanmani et\
    \ al. (2021), \nwhere Deep Learning models are frequently utilised for image and\
    \ sound \nprocessing, deep learning models have greatly improved the state-of-the-art.\
    \ \n \nProposed system \nAn automated irrigation system is proposed that works\
    \ with sensors and sense \natmospheric parameters, soil moisture and capture sky\
    \ image to know the types of \nclouds present to predict the rainfall whether\
    \ it will be no rain, low to medium rain or \nmedium to high rain which will help\
    \ in making decision on the time for which motor \nshould kept on. As shown in\
    \ Figure 2, the rain prediction model combines machine \nlearning model using\
    \ parameters from the atmosphere (temperature, relative \nhumidity, atmospheric\
    \ pressure) and deep learning technique (by giving input as \nsky/cloud image)\
    \ to predict the intensity of rain.  \n101 \n \n \n \nFigure 2:  Rain prediction\
    \ device model   \n \nThe working process is presented in the form of an algorithm\
    \ as shown in Figure 3, \nwhere soil moisture is recorded continuously and once\
    \ it reaches a nearby \nthreshold it triggers a rain prediction model by sensing\
    \ atmospheric parameters \nusing sensors that are integrated with Raspberry Pi\
    \ along with the integrated USB \ncamera which gets activated and captures live\
    \ images of the sky. \nNext, the atmospheric parameters temperature, relative\
    \ humidity and atmospheric \npressure are provided to the machine learning model\
    \ as input, the Random Forest \nalgorithm is trained on the dataset based on Hyderabad\
    \ city which is collected from \nthe NASA Power Data Viewer for Daily Data, that\
    \ contains a variety of climate \ncharacteristics. The most important ones, however,\
    \ are selected, and the data is \ntaken for a 40-year period between May 1981\
    \ and 2021. Given that there are \ntypically 64–65 rainy days per year, a large\
    \ period is used to gather enough data \nand is used to predict the rainfall.\
    \ The dataset is manually downloaded and created \nas per the requirements as\
    \ well as experimented by Geeta Ambildhuke and Barnali \nGupta Banik (2022). At\
    \ the same time, the images of the sky/cloud are fetched as \nan input to the\
    \ deep learning model trained on a ground-based cloud dataset to get \nthe rainfall\
    \ prediction based on the types of clouds present in the sky at that time is \n\
    also demonstrated by Ambildhuke, Geeta Mahadeo, and Barnali Gupta (2021). \n \n\
    \ \n102 \n \n \n \nFigure 3:  Algorithm for automatic water balance irrigation\
    \ model powered by \nrain prediction   \nOnce the inputs are given to the machine\
    \ learning model and deep learning model \nthe output is given as the intensity\
    \ (as probability) of rain, whether it will be No rain \nto Low Rain, Low to Medium\
    \ Rain or Medium to High rain and then depending on \nthe rainfall prediction\
    \ the motor will be ON and irrigate the field for particular time as \nshown in\
    \ Figure 4.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4:  Workflow of the automatic Irrigation model\
    \   \n \n103 \n \nMethodology \n \nThe state of the soil water for an irrigated\
    \ crop must be monitored on a regular basis \nto assist the irrigation manager\
    \ in making irrigation decisions. Irrigation scheduling \nis typically accomplished\
    \ in one of two ways. One method is to use soil moisture \nsensors to monitor\
    \ soil water directly. On the other hand, the soil-water balance \nstrategy, uses\
    \ weather data to account for soil-water in the rooting depth. Weather-\nbased\
    \ or evapotranspiration (ET) based irrigation scheduling or water balancing \n\
    method are common terms for this method. \n \nEvapotranspiration \nIn a farm environment,\
    \ ET offers an objective and reliable estimate of the water \nrequirements of\
    \ actively growing crops. Irrigators can better schedule irrigations \nusing evapotranspiration\
    \ data resulting in higher yields and higher water \nproductivity. \nET is described\
    \ as the cumulative process of evaporation from soil and plant \nsurfaces, as\
    \ well as transpiration from plant canopies to the atmosphere via the \nstomates\
    \ (tiny holes on the leaf surface). Water is released in the form of water \n\
    vapor from the plant surfaces and soil into the atmosphere as part of the ET \n\
    process. Advanced approaches can be used to directly measure crop ET. However,\
    \ \nthe most typical approach of predicting the ET rate for a specific crop involves\
    \ first \ncomputing reference ET0 and then using the appropriate crop factors\
    \ to determine \nreal crop ET explained in Antonopoulos et al. (2017). \nThe formula\
    \ for determining the water need is discussed in Eq. (1) based on \nagricultural\
    \ literature.  \nET0 * Kc= Wrequired or (ETc)            \n \n (1),  \nWhere,\
    \ Wrequired denotes the amount of water required.  \nWhere ET0 is the reference\
    \ evapotranspiration - which is the evapotranspiration \nfrom a reference crop\
    \ and is calculated using standardized Penman-Monteith \nequation and Kc is the\
    \ crop factor. Kc varies by crop development stage as \nelaborated in Djaman et\
    \ al.(2018). \n \nTechnology Used \n \n Deep Learning Model is implemented to\
    \ get the prediction from the cloud images \ncaptured that uses a transfer learning\
    \ approach to train the pretrained model on \nnew dataset of cloud images. Machine\
    \ learning models are trained on three \natmospheric temperatures, humidity and\
    \ pressure to get rain prediction and \nRandom Forest Model is selected due to\
    \ its good accuracy and predictions. The \nmain feature of this device is the\
    \ use of Edge analytics where the collection of data, \nprocessing of data and\
    \ predicting output and automation is all done at the device \nlevel that does\
    \ not require any cloud infrastructure and internet connectivity so can \nbe used\
    \ at any remote location without internet and requires only a power of 5V to \n\
    start the device as demonstrated by Geeta Ambildhuke and Barnali Gupta Banik \n\
    (2022). \n \nSoftware Use \n \nPython code is used to build the DL Model and also\
    \ to get the sensor data collected \nfrom the sensors connected to the Raspberry\
    \ Pi device. Because the Deep \nLearning model and machine learning models were\
    \ trained on Python 3, all  \n \n104 \n \nsupporting libraries with the required\
    \ versions Keras 2.4.3, Tensor Flow-2.4.0-rc2, \nScikitlearn-0.20.2, and OpenCV\
    \ -4.5.3 were installed.    \n \nDevice Setup \nThe device consists of Raspberry\
    \ Pi which is the controller that has a trained \nmachine learning model (pickle\
    \ file) and deep learning model (.h5 file). To collect \nthe real data, sensors\
    \ like DHT11, BMP 180, USB Camera, are connected for the \nprediction of rainfall\
    \ along with motor and soil moisture sensor. This is used to \nautomate the irrigation\
    \ process without any intervention of the farmer and this \ndevice does not require\
    \ any cloud platform and WIFI as the input collection, running \nmodels and giving\
    \ prediction is all done at the device level itself. The specification \nof DHT11\
    \ and BMP180 sensors are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. \nAs BMP180, OLED Display\
    \ are I2C devices, they are connected to Raspberry \nthrough I2C interface available\
    \ on board. I2C devices have their unique address \nand can access the modules\
    \ through these unique address for sending and \nreceiving the data. \n \nTable\

    As Raspberry PI does not have analog data pins, to read the soil moisture data,\
    \ an \nanalog-to-digital converter module ADS1115 is used for converting the soil\
    \ moisture \nvalues received from the soil moisture voltage values to analog values.\
    \ Analog to \nDigital Converter (ADC) used here is an I2C device and the module\
    \ is connected to \nI2C pins on the Raspberry Pi board. Through I2C communication\
    \ the data is read \nand processed as per the requirement of the application.\
    \ Once the soil moisture \nsensor values cross a threshold value, then the prediction\
    \ is taken and switch the \n5V water pump ON/OFF accordingly which is controlled\
    \ by a motor driver shield. \n \nThe sensors are chosen based on their simplicity\
    \ and affordability and are working \nvery well with the device and captures input\

    \ models with different sensors and weather data from nearby \nweather stations.\
    \  For the data collected and analysed as shown in Figure 5 the \nArduino UNO\
    \ is the most popular node for irrigation automation and monitoring, \nVeerachamy\
    \ et al. (2022).  For the requirement of the proposed device deep \nlearning and\
    \ machine learning models need to be run on the device level only \nRaspberry\
    \ Pi is chosen for the experiment.  \n \n \n \nFigure 5:  Controllers used in\
    \ precision agriculture for automatic irrigation\n \n106 \n \nResults and Discussion\
    \ \n \nThe device prototype is made with the IoT components to sense atmospheric\
    \ \nparameters using sensors like DHT11, BMP 180, USB Camera, and Soil Moisture\
    \ \nSensor. \n \nArduino-based Soil moisture Sensor is used to monitor the amount\
    \ of moisture in \nthe soil. Soil moisture level can be determined by the output\
    \ voltage produced \nbased on resistance. If water is more conductivity will be\
    \ more and resistance will \nbe less and vice versa. For easy understanding, the\
    \ output voltage is scaled \nbetween 0-100 values. When the value of Soil moisture\
    \ is 100, it means the soil is \ncompletely dry García, L.et al. (2020). \n \n\
    1. Based on the soil nature various threshold values are devised to know the wet-\n\
    ness using a soil moisture sensor and the motor is allowed to work only \non need.\
    \ \n \n2. Once the soil moisture value goes near the threshold the rain prediction\
    \ model \ngets started and the USB camera gets activated to capture the current\
    \ sky im-\nages and are passed as input to the deep learning model to get the\
    \ prediction of \nrainfall based on types of clouds present in that location at\
    \ the current time. \n \n3. Equally, the atmospheric parameters sensed are passed\
    \ as input to the ma-\nchine learning model to predict the rainfall probability\
    \ based on the sensed pa-\nrameters at the current location at the current time.\
    \ \n \n4. Based on the prediction the motor will be ON for the time to fulfil\
    \ the need of \ncrops by keeping track of rain. \n \nThe device is used for rain\
    \ prediction before taking the decision on irrigating the \ncrop when soil moisture\
    \ goes below the threshold. The motor pump and controller \nare connected by the\
    \ relay. The relay performs the function of a digital switch, \nturning the motor\
    \ pump ON or OFF in response to commands from the controller. A \n5v Dc motor\
    \ is used to pump water for the demonstration purpose. The deployment \ncost at\
    \ initial stage, particularly for small-scale farmers, is one of the key hurdles\
    \ in \nadopting digital technologies, machine learning and software applications\
    \ in terms \nof enhancing sustainable precision irrigation. \n \n107 \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \nFigure 6:  Automatic irrigation using real time parameters \n \n\
    As depicted in Figure 6. The soil moisture shows little change and remains almost\
    \ \nconstant after evening hours as there is no significant loss in moisture from\
    \ the \nplant due to reduced evapotranspiration rate. \nThis necessitates the\
    \ digitization of the farm process, as well as the usage of \nsensors, actuators,\
    \ and networking of precision agriculture devices. Water use \nefficiency can\
    \ be enhanced by better predicting irrigation needs, better matching \ntiming\
    \ and volume to plant water needs, and adaptively compensating for water loss\
    \ \nowing to evapotranspiration. This automatic irrigation results in a higher\
    \ yield while \nutilizing less irrigation and wasting less irrigation water. The\
    \ system becomes smart \nand can have certain autonomous features for irrigation\
    \ decision-making as a result \nof the model’s training and ultimate implementation.\
    \ As a result, most of the \nirrigation stress experienced by farmers and users\
    \ can be reduced.  \n \nConclusion and Recommendations \n \nNational and international\
    \ institutes have recognized the notion of climate-smart \nagriculture, and various\
    \ programmes have been launched to create climate-smart \ntechnologies. However,\
    \ the adoption and distribution of climate-smart technology, \ntools, and behaviours\
    \ is still primarily a continuous and complicated process. The \nfarming community\
    \ can only optimise water usage through the use of smart \nirrigation systems.\
    \ It is a smart system because of the auto mode, and it may be \nfurther adjusted\
    \ for application-specific conditions. The integration of smart \ntechnology like\
    \ deep learning, machine learning and IoT is majorly driving \nagriculture to\
    \ sustainability and productivity by achieving sustainable precision \nirrigation\
    \ by controlling the usage of water. To fill the technology gap, adopting best\
    \ \npractices is crucial, and digital communication is required. Technology diffusion\
    \ \nheavily relies on agricultural extension, an area where the private sector\
    \ is \nbecoming more involved.  \n \n108 \n \n \nFor the Indian agricultural industry,\
    \ the successful development and wide-scale \napplication of precision agricultural\
    \ technologies are still a long way off. Such smart \nfarming concepts would enable\
    \ the Indian agro-industry to undergo a transformation \nthanks to the nation's\
    \ expanding IT sector and extensive Agri-IT research. Rapid \nsocioeconomic developments\
    \ including urbanization, energy consumption, and \neconomic expansion are opening\
    \ new possibilities for the use of precision farming \nin India. India should\
    \ employ technology depending on the demands of the nation's \nsocioeconomic situation\
    \ rather than blindly embracing the sophisticated precision \nagriculture technologies\
    \ used by Western nations. \n \nReferences \n \nAhmed, A. A., Al Omari, S., Awal,\

    Tools Abstract Listen Water treatment is necessary to ensure the availability
    of clean and safe water for various uses. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT)
    technology with water purification systems has shown enormous potential in recent
    years for enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of the treatment process. Monitoring
    the disposal of sewage in treatment facilities is the primary obstacle. As a result,
    a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, including the IoT,
    has been proposed to ensure the proper operation of these sewer systems and limit
    the risk of overflow and malfunction. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach
    that blends Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) with an IoT-based water treatment system
    equipped with a SCADA system for increased monitoring and control. An IoT–SCADA
    system can be implemented at various wastewater collection and treatment phases.
    Secondly, incorporating DBNs enhances the system''s predictive capabilities, enabling
    proactive maintenance and decision-making to prevent potential failures and optimize
    resource allocation. The proposed technique computes the efficacy of the effluent
    treatment facility and ensures that chemical emissions do not exceed permissible
    limits. Furthermore, Complex Event Processing (CEP) can be utilized to evaluate
    and analyze the massive influx of real-time data sets provided by IoT sensors.

    water treatment INTRODUCTION Listen Water is a precious resource that sustains
    life on Earth, yet it is becoming increasingly scarce and polluted. There is a
    greater need than ever for effective and efficient water treatment solutions.
    As Internet of Things (IoT) technology progresses, intelligent water treatment
    systems are being developed to optimize water treatment processes and reduce waste.
    Smart IoT-based water treatment, in this context, is a cutting-edge technology
    that employs IoT to build an intelligent and self-contained water treatment system.
    This technology increases treatment efficiency and efficacy by integrating sensors,
    data analytics, and machine learning algorithms to continuously monitor and control
    several aspects of the water treatment process. In this article, we will examine
    the main characteristics and advantages of intelligent IoT-based water treatment
    and how it might revolutionize the water treatment sector. Many different types
    of living things rely greatly on water to survive. There are growing worries about
    water shortage due to increased water use brought on by a rise in the human population
    (Ma et al. 2020). In addition to the widespread concern about freshwater shortages
    for drinking, there are growing worries about water shortages for agriculture
    (Rosa et al. 2020). A strong water management system is necessary to address the
    issues caused by water scarcity. Real-time monitoring of water quality and equality
    is essential for effective water management. Real-time water level monitoring
    can significantly reduce the water wasted by a tank overflow. The water management
    system can help find water leaks in an intelligent home by monitoring water levels
    throughout the day. Making the world a better place requires a cutting-edge water
    management system. One of the foremost reasons for the low adoption of intelligent
    water management systems is their high cost (Singh & Ahmed 2021). The development
    of IoT for smart cities has resulted in a sharp decline in prices in recent years
    (Vallino et al. 2020). An interconnected system of objects known as the ‘Internet
    of Things’ transmits and receives data. Low-cost IoT-based water management technology
    has become more well-liked recently. IoT devices are perfect for monitoring water
    levels in real-time since they can exchange data without assistance from a human.
    Scientists have recently explored a range of markers of water quality, including
    temperature, conductivity, pH, biochemical oxygen demand, and total dissolved
    solids (TDS). In smart cities, real-time water quality monitoring is becoming
    more prevalent. The IoT-based water management system is shown in perspective
    in Figure 1. A typical setup might include a controller, sensors, and data visualization
    software. The controller can monitor variables like pH and turbidity with the
    help of sensors. The data for the measurement are gathered by sensors and transmitted
    to the organizer. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE The proposed method of IoT–SCADA.
    An organizer is a little computer that can run applications and associate with
    them a network. It can be set up to gather sensor data and send it online for
    archiving and analysis. An application is a program that runs online and provides
    data through a user interface in response to input from a controller. IoT-based
    systems for water management are low-cost and easy to scale. It is straightforward
    to verify the water''s quality for the presence of various impurities thanks to
    reasonably priced sensors. Communication technologies that are readily accessible
    enable deployment in an existing system with little configuration. Monitoring
    and controlling equipment from a distance is straightforward when IoT platforms
    are used (Hammi et al. 2018). The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
    system is utilized to manage the filtering process. A plant can be monitored and
    controlled, and data can be collected using a group called SCADA. Computers have
    rapidly advanced over the past few decades and are now an essential component
    of a contemporary SCADA system (Anshori 2015). The water treatment facility''s
    filtering procedure will use this system. This technology will make the filtering
    process more accessible by automatically controlling and monitoring the process
    without human involvement. The filtration process can also be observed across
    vast distances without constant visits. SCADA systems provide the necessary infrastructure
    for real-time monitoring, control, data acquisition, alarm, and remote access
    in a smart water treatment system. They enhance operational efficiency, ensure
    system integrity, and enable informed decision-making for effective water treatment
    processes. There is one system, called DCS, that is comparable to SCADA. The distributed
    control system (DCS), centered on a control room with various control, monitoring,
    and optimization functions, distributes numerous tasks that govern different process
    variables and operation units. The integrated DCS system is designed to control
    manufacturing processes that are batch- or continuous-oriented, like paper production,
    petrochemical production, central station operations, and oil refining (Hamidi
    et al. 2019). DCS and SCADA operate similarly to one another in terms of how they
    perform control and monitoring. However, there are some distinctions between the
    two systems. DCS can only be accessed by specific operators within a particular
    range or communicate with operators within a limited range. Operators have unlimited
    access to SCADA at any time and from any location. Additionally, SCADA has data
    acquisition, whereas DCS merely monitors. Thus, the system has the most recent
    and earlier data in a process. In contrast to SCADA, which uses open-loop control,
    DCS uses closed-loop power, meaning that the output impacts the plant (feedback).
    While SCADA needs a low-speed communication system, DCS needs a high-speed, reliable
    one. According to the comparison above, SCADA is more helpful than DCS. However,
    SCADA and DCS each have advantages and drawbacks of their own. SCADA has advanced
    over time, become more valuable and affordable, and its general application can
    be used for both industrial and small-scale (prototype) processes. A Remote Terminal
    Unit (RTU) or other tool is needed to integrate a SCADA system infiltration. The
    IoT concept builds on the existing vision of conventional SCADA and enables real-time
    data gathering and transfer across several protocols. The procedure entails connecting
    various physical components to digital representations and integrating them into
    information systems. The idea of the IoT makes it easier for advanced modules
    and services to be seamlessly integrated and compatible, enabling data aggregation
    and the preservation of historical data for analysis. This method improves our
    comprehension of the collected data by offering insightful information. Real-time
    information monitoring and process control are the cornerstones of SCADA. A thorough
    understanding of production quality can be attained by integrating an integrated
    SCADA architecture with an IoT platform that supports various network protocols.
    Contribution Listen This study recommends a supervisory control and data collection
    system based on the IoT to ensure the effectiveness of these sewer systems and
    lessen the likelihood of overflow and malfunction. Various stages of wastewater
    collection and treatment can use an IoT–SCADA system. An intelligent water sensor
    driven by the IoT analyses water dynamics. It continuously assesses water quality,
    pressure, and temperature to map the water flow across the whole treatment capability.
    The suggested approach determines the effluent treatment facility''s efficacy
    and ensures that chemical emissions stay within permitted limits. Complex event
    processing (CEP) can also be used to analyze and handle the enormous stream of
    data sets produced in real-time by IoT sensors. The system also examines the gathered
    data and delivers insightful data using cutting-edge data analytics methods. These
    perceptions can help with treatment process optimization, prospective issue detection,
    and system maintenance and improvement choices. The system may also automate specific
    tasks thanks to the integration of IoT and SCADA, which lowers the need for manual
    intervention and boosts operational effectiveness. The remaining portions of the
    article are organized as follows: agricultural, industrial, and residential uses
    are separated in Section 2''s categorization of current publications on this topic.
    Section 3 recommended a SCADA organization that uses an IoT strategy. The results
    of the experiment are discussed in Section 4. The final section of the investigation
    is Section 5. LITERATURE SURVEY Listen The necessity of practical, theoretical,
    and empirical development was underlined by Dhanwani et al. (2021) to comprehend
    how intelligent technology may help the ecosystem flourish without damaging it.
    The secondary goal was to ensure that an extensive study of Smart Environmental
    Pollution Monitoring Systems offers many opportunities to increase understanding
    of environmental management by applying cutting-edge international technology.
    By examining historical tendencies, they worked with other academics to promote
    various ‘smart’ solutions. As a result, research has a better, greener, and more
    intelligent future. Sustainable technology has also advanced, and a civilization
    free of pollution has been created. Pujar et al. (2020) described an IoT-based
    business for real-time water quality monitoring. Water quality indicators for
    the Krishna River included pH, demand, temperature, biochemical oxygen, conductivity,
    and TDS. The controller was an Arduino Mega 2560. The system used one-way and
    two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyze the data. The outcomes demonstrated
    that one-way ANOVA was the most successful IoT system control strategy. The study
    also showed how many variables affect water quality throughout the year. A wireless
    sensor network with IoT capabilities was utilized by Zin et al. (2019) to monitor
    water quality continuously. They used several parts, including a computer, an
    FPGA, a wireless Zigbee connection, and a protocol. In Curtin Lake in northern
    Sarawak on the island of Borneo, they employed the technology to track the pH,
    turbidity, temperature, water level, and carbon dioxide on the lake''s surface.
    The technique cuts down on expenses and energy usage. A thorough analysis of IoT
    device applications for intelligent irrigation systems was published by García
    et al. (2020). The study presented in-depth analyses of sensor networks for irrigation
    systems, soil monitoring, and weather monitoring. The survey indicates that the
    most popular IoT nodes for irrigation organizations are Arduino boards. Numerous
    IoT systems are carefully studied concerning their maximum data throughput and
    frequency spectrum. According to the report, Wi-Fi is the communication technology
    that is most widely used. The most commonly used database system is MySQL, and
    the most widely used cloud platform is discovered to be ThingSpeak. Smart water
    meters with IoT integration from Nasser et al. (2020) automatically transfer data
    to the cloud after regular data collection intervals. The system''s design used
    microservices and containers to manage real-time streaming and infrastructure
    effectiveness. The authors employed machine learning methods like Random Forest
    and Support Vector Regression for time series forecasting applications. Comparative
    investigation showed that the suggested model was superior and may be used as
    a benchmark for others. Sengupta et al. (2019) leverage IoT to provide a low-cost
    method for controlling and monitoring water quality in real-time. Using an analog-to-digital
    converter, a Raspberry Pi is connected to sensors for temperature, turbidity,
    and pH. Instructions for the solenoid valve to turn on or off water flow from
    the overhead tank to the dwellings will be delivered based on data gathered by
    numerous sensors and processed by the Raspberry Pi. This entire method is carried
    out automatically, with no human intervention, saving time spent dealing with
    the issue manually. Finally, it decides whether or not the water quality parameters
    are within the acceptable range. All of these devices are inexpensive, versatile,
    and effective. Woźniak et al. (2021) developed a fuzzy rules control model for
    a next-generation home environment with electronic components, infrastructure,
    and appropriate applications. The technology is being developed for the next stage
    of the IoT and is based on 6G network connectivity technologies. Through adaptive
    ventilation, the suggested control technique effectively manages water flow, windscreen
    monitoring, safety concerns, and carbon dioxide reduction. The latest 6G connectivity
    protocol was designed to interact with the technology, enhancing data flow, and
    dependability at the local area network and end-user interface levels. The E-Sensor
    AQUA water quality monitoring system was created and tested in the Mekong Delta
    by IDanh et al. (Vinh et al. 2020). The instrument determined the temperature,
    water''s salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH. The solution utilized the IoT platform
    ThingSpeak to save data on the cloud server. Every minute, the master controller
    takes the data gathered from the sensor nodes and updates the information stored
    on the cloud server. Apps for Android and iOS smartphones may be used to access
    the system and view the data. Luccio et al. (2020) have suggested a technique
    for obtaining coastal data using sensors and devices installed in naval equipment.
    The distributed pleasure boat sensor network for marine and atmospheric studies
    is the name of the technology. The results show that by including crowd-sourced
    bathymetry data in the process of computational model design, the end consequences''
    precision is improved, and a more exact spatial pattern of the sea current transporting
    the tracers is made possible. A model developed by Gupta et al. (2021) automatically
    assesses water quality variables like turbidity, pH, and temperature. The ESP32
    was chosen for underwater communication because of its built-in Wi-Fi and low
    battery consumption. The IoT-based model was built using communication modules,
    a turbidity meter, and a pH sensor. Additionally, based on previously computed
    data, a machine learning method based on K Means was used to examine water quality.
    The constructed locomotive model regularly assesses the water quality in large
    and small bodies of water. The central pollution control board can visit the webpage
    displaying the readings. A robot can monitor the quality of the water anyplace.
    This project is self-sufficient and effective because the designed model is affordable,
    and the robot can communicate underwater using high-speed Wi-Fi. Demissie et al.
    (2021) suggested a surfactant-based method as an adequate but energy-intensive
    substitute for eliminating dangerous pollutants from water. The elimination of
    pollutants, including the recycling of concentrated aqua, was evaluated by the
    authors, who discovered no signs of degradation. The authors discussed various
    strategies for enhancing process efficiency and obstacles and opportunities for
    further study in wastewater treatment. A low-cost intelligent irrigation system
    for farming is presented by Akhund et al. (2022). Agriculture is moving to automated,
    remote monitoring and IoT network-integrated fog, cloud, and automation technologies.
    With a hardware sensor and a microcontroller, we developed a prototype that can
    gauge the temperature, humidity, and water level. The purpose of this study is
    to identify whether to switch on or off the motor by using a variety of sensors
    to measure a variety of readings and values. We present the main algorithm and
    flowchart of the system. Our automated system, built on an IoT application, creates
    a self-contained irrigation system and notifies us remotely by SMS on our mobile
    devices. Yousif & Abdalgader (2022) present a real-time monitoring and auto-watering
    system based on mathematical models that establish and control the required water
    rate. It helps with water saving by giving the plant the proper amount. Additionally,
    it ensures interoperability across many sensor data sources necessary for large-scale
    agricultural analytics. The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides
    access to the mathematical model for sensing soil moisture levels and calculating
    if they drop below a predetermined threshold value, at which time plant watering
    is automatically started. The suggested strategy boosts productivity through irrigation
    optimization while using less water (more than 70% less) to increase irrigation
    system efficacy (Yasin et al. 2021). The need for water from competing economic
    sectors increases as the population rises. Because of this, it is impossible to
    meet human needs for water while maintaining the natural flows necessary to protect
    our ecosystems. Many areas are losing underground water, which increases the likelihood
    that present and future generations may experience more climatic fluctuation.
    Because of this, information technology techniques and internet communication
    technologies (ICTs) play a crucial role in water resource management by minimizing
    excessive freshwater wastage and managing and monitoring water contamination.
    In this paper, we will examine studies that use the IoT as a communication tool
    to regulate the preservation of available water and prevent it from being wasted
    by households and farmers. Limitations of existing system Listen Due to their
    reliance on the internet, intelligent IoT-based water treatment systems are susceptible
    to operational disruptions from connectivity failures, power outages, or other
    technical challenges. Additionally, fouling or calibration drift may impact the
    sensors'' dependability to detect water quality. An innovative IoT-based water
    treatment system''s implementation can be pricey because it calls for hardware,
    software, and maintenance expenditures. For smaller or less financially secure
    organizations, these fees can be exorbitant. Cyber-attacks could lead to data
    breaches or system failures in intelligent IoT-based water treatment plants. These
    systems need more resources and knowledge to ensure their security. Qualified
    operators and maintenance workers must operate and maintain intelligent IoT-based
    water treatment systems. For these systems to function well, people must be adequately
    taught and competent to manage them. More extensive or sophisticated water treatment
    facilities won''t readily scale up intelligent IoT-based water treatment systems.
    As a result, they might work better in smaller systems or as an addition to more
    conventional water treatment techniques. Smart IoT-based water treatment systems
    may need specialized analysis tools and knowledge to properly analyze and utilize
    the massive amounts of data they create. False assumptions and errors in the decision-making
    process might result from a lack of comprehension of the evidence or inaccurate
    interpretation. Problem identification of existing system Listen Despite being
    a fundamental human right, a significant section of the world lacks access to
    clean, safe drinking water. To ensure a sustainable water supply, addressing problems
    such as water pollution, the depletion of freshwater resources, and inadequate
    sanitization is crucial. Conventional water treatment methods employ chemicals,
    which could harm the environment and people''s health. Additionally, the conventional
    approach to water treatment consumes many resources and energy, making it only
    seldom practical in locations with limited resources. A cutting-edge IoT-based
    system for water treatment can effectively monitor, evaluate, and treat water
    in real-time to get past these problems. The system must identify water quality
    issues and react quickly to remove potential health risks. ‘A Smart IoT-based
    water treatment system’ aims to create a long-lasting, affordable, and adequate
    water treatment system that uses the most recent IoT technology to continually
    monitor, evaluate, and treat water. Through the system, which should be able to
    deal with challenges like water pollution, the depletion of freshwater supplies,
    and poor sanitation, everyone should have access to safe and clean drinking water.
    PROPOSED SYSTEM IoT-powered smart water management system Listen While estimating
    the effectiveness of the effluent treatment facility, the method described in
    this component makes sure that chemical emissions do not go over permissible limits.
    In addition, advanced event processing can be used to analyze and manage the massive
    influx of data sets generated in real-time by IoT devices. Additionally, the system
    employs cutting-edge data analytics methods to analyze the gathered data and produce
    insightful results. The treatment process can be optimized using these insights,
    which can also be used to spot possible issues and make decisions about system
    maintenance and improvement. Additionally, the system may automate specific tasks
    thanks to the integration of IoT and SCADA, which lowers the need for manual intervention
    and boosts operational effectiveness. The block diagram for the IoT–SCADA technique
    is shown in Figure 1. The ability to monitor, regulate, and optimize water treatment
    procedures is improved by using smart water treatment systems. This leads to improved
    water quality and safety, reduced risks of contamination, increased operational
    efficiency, and more effective water supply system management. The enterprise
    of an intelligent water organization is suggested in this section while keeping
    in mind the main takeaways from the analyses of the various strategies that were
    previously described. A real-time, intelligent water management system based on
    the IoT is advised to monitor water levels and quality indicators. The suggested
    approach will be controlled by a controller in the Raspberry Pi manner and run
    programs written in well-known programming languages like PYTHON. The pH sensor
    and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic range sensor will be connected to the controller to
    provide data on the water''s quality and level. The proposed system combined water
    quality sensors such as pH and temperature, turbidity, water distribution sensors
    such as ultrasonic water level and flow, and microcontrollers through an IoT system,
    allowing residents to control the incoming water quality level via an installed
    home-based water filter. Integrating IoT systems like Blynk (Blynk – IoT platform
    for businesses and developers n.d.) within the controller is crucial for real-time
    monitoring. These platforms can remotely administer Raspberry Pi and other IoT
    devices. This integration lets the mobile app show the water level in real-time.
    Monitoring the water level and other quality indicators on a secure website is
    crucial. The Google Sheets API should allow the proposed solution to update Google
    Sheets in real-time (Sheets API | Google developers n.d.). A straightforward application
    programming interface called the Google Sheets API makes it easy to read and publish
    data from Raspberry Pi and other low-powered machines to Google Sheets. An API
    key is required for every read-and-write query to change data values securely
    and to thwart replay attempts. The stakeholders can be informed of the generated
    alerts and predictions to react appropriately. Figure 2 shows the IoT-based water
    management organization. Implementing a layered security approach that combines
    Data Encryption and Authentication access control, these measures help protect
    IoT-based water treatment systems from cyber threats and ensure the overall safety
    and integrity of the system. It is essential to regularly update and adapt security
    measures as new threats and vulnerabilities emerge to maintain a robust defense
    against potential attacks. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Using the Internet
    of Things to manage water. Essential qualities Listen After carefully examining
    the relevant studies in this field, we offer the following essential components
    for a successful, intelligent water management system: Low cost: The system should
    not have a high overall price. Large-scale implementation is discouraged by the
    expensive cost, particularly in intelligent campuses and smart cities. Low energy
    consumption: The system must consume less energy in light of the rising energy
    demand and its environmental effects. Energy costs can be decreased by using renewable
    energy sources like solar energy. Ease of deployment and upkeep: The system must
    be simple to set up and maintain. It should be able to reset and maintain software
    remotely. Water level and quality restrictions: It''s critical to evaluate and
    record additional quality information in addition to water level for a comprehensive
    water management organization. Different sensors increase energy use, which raises
    the price. Real-time water monitoring is something that a smart water management
    system should offer. To find water leaks and overflows, real-time tracking may
    be helpful. Real-time monitoring necessitates a constantly connected network as
    well as heavy energy consumption. Cloud computing also makes it possible to make
    decisions instantly. Security: Protecting IoT messages and devices can be challenging,
    especially when dispersed over numerous physical locations. Hackers may take advantage
    of operating system flaws to steal sensitive data. Due to their constant Internet
    connection, these gadgets are good candidates for both infiltrations. To conduct
    DDoS attacks, many malwares, including Mirai (Antonakakis et al. 2017) and Hajime
    (Kolias et al. 2017), infect IoT devices in their network. Complex Event Processing
    Listen Real-time behavioral patterns can be identified by recording and analyzing
    event streams using CEP (Bok et al. 2018). Smart meters, energy management, and
    agricultural irrigation are a few application areas where CEP is essential (Fardbastani
    & Sharifi 2019). The pressure and volume of water flowing through pipes are measured
    as part of water management systems to spot leakage patterns and foresee mishaps.
    A set of CEP rules specifies each design. The procedures for filtering, aggregating,
    correlating, and transforming data flows are limited by regulations. The architecture
    of the CEP is shown in Figure 3. When the event streams are received, the CEP
    engine applies the CEP rules to search for specific patterns. When a design is
    identified to alert human operators or other systems, the CEP engine delivers
    an alert. Data flows can be filtered, aggregated, correlated, and transformed
    using CEP rules, which are queries. The Event Processing Language (EPL) is used
    in this work to specify the CEP rules. Each CEP rule in this study identifies
    an active water management policy. For instance, once every 2 min, the rule checks
    to see if the 12-s average pressure is higher than a predetermined threshold.
    This work employs CEP principles in adding to water management instructions to
    spot unfavorable situations, such as a water storage tank''s rapid decline or
    a critical water level (too high or too low), and warn water managers of the pattern
    (Gonçalves et al. 2020). Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Complex Event Processing
    (CEP) architecture. Supervisory controller and data acquirement method Listen
    SCADA schemes can be used for both distribution and wastewater treatment. Operators
    can monitor and carry out control activities at the PC-based workstation in a
    control room found in plants. In distribution plants, SCADA monitors various processes,
    including chemical treatment, temperature control, filtration, sedimentation,
    and tank grades. In water control systems and facilities, SCADA also encourages
    corporate system integration, financial efficiency, and design safety (Metwally
    & Gupta 2022). Wastewater collection, water treatment, distribution, and therapy
    may be monitored and managed thanks to computer-controlled systems (SCADA), which
    utilize several communication networks. The platform allows gathering data, controlling
    administration, and sending and receiving commands across a network. The communication
    system may employ telemetry, wireless, or cable links. SCADA systems worked together
    to boost water delivery to homes, companies, and industries while lowering service
    operating costs. The monitoring and control capabilities of SCADA will allow companies
    to safeguard and stop the significant deterioration of their infrastructure. Real-time
    control (RTC) ideal pump settings have been determined using data from various
    SCADA systems. Using mathematical models, the water distribution network designs
    simulate and approximate network statements and parameters under certain operating
    and loading conditions. The best mathematical models that have been applied to
    managing challenges in water delivery systems are covered in this section. Proposition
    1 (Stay-State and Dynamic Hydraulic Model). At each time step, the steady-state
    model determines the state variables of the hydraulic network. The water distribution
    system is shown in an illustration. Kirchhoff uses the first law to examine the
    conservation of flow (mass conservation) at the ends of a pipe network. (1) Equation
    (1) states that is the flow in the connection bridging nodes v and u, is the demand
    at node i, and U is the total number of nodes. The energy conservation law is
    another name for the second Kirchhoff conservation law. Any network loop has no
    total head loss. (2) This is shown in Equation (2), where N and H are the pip''s
    loop count and head loss, respectively. Since there is only one accessible tank,
    there is no need for pseudo circles between fixed heads, which keeps things straightforward.
    Later, this was taken for granted. The relationship between flow-to-head loss
    and the network''s third equation may be seen. Ohm''s law is demonstrated on this
    page. The following acronym stands for the word: (3) The resistance of the nodes
    v and u connected by the pipe is denoted by in Equation (3), the fixed head loss
    exponent is denoted by m. The resistance coefficient of a valve can be affected
    by its local head loss coefficient and diameter. A characteristic curve shows
    the relationship between head gain and flow in a pump. This can be approximated
    using the parabolic function. (4) As seen in Equation (4), the features (1) through
    (4), where ⁠, ⁠, and the pump supplier coefficients comprise a collection of nonlinear
    equations describing how water distribution networks maintain their constant state.
    The flows and heads in these water distribution networks can explain the calculations
    if all piping resistances, operational pump numbers, node specifications, valve
    opening degrees (working circumstances), speeds, and reservoir rates are understood.
    The dynamic hydraulic model, the EPS, shows how water distribution network hydraulic
    behavior changes over time. The following has often been required of a node that
    has tanks or storage components by the mass preservation regulation: (5) Equation
    (5) can express the tan''s storage capacity at Node i as Xu, where t stands for
    the passage of time. Fu and Au are exhibited sequentially for each ‘head,’ ‘total
    tank level and height,’ and ‘tank cross section area.’ An illustration of the
    tank is (6) Extend Equation (6) to a network of multiple tanks. A dynamic network
    model can be expressed using a sequence of different comparisons. (7) dF/dt denotes
    the waste utilization rate per unit volume of digester, mass/volume-time. The
    cross-sectional areas in Equation (7) are symbolized by vector B, the tank heads
    by vector F, and the net inflows into the tanks by vector PV. Numerical techniques
    (such as forwards Euler and enhanced Euler), hybrid transitional techniques, and
    direct integration approaches can all be used to solve the Tank Differential Equation.
    It is generally believed that the customer''s water requirements are gathered
    in the nodes where the pressure heads are calculated. The distribution of water
    requirements along pipes is not uniform, though. Proposition 2 (Graphs models
    connect). An efficient way to represent a water distribution network is as a linked
    graph with few connecting nodes. A graph element is a directed edge with two unique
    ends (often called a vertex). Each edge''s diameter, length, and degree of roughness
    are provided. Bands could include pumps, valves, components, bends, pipelines,
    or other hydraulic apparatus where head loss and flow are known to be correlated.
    The endpoints are the data nodes or junction points that connect to water sources
    or storage tanks. The basic mathematical formulas for a network of interconnected
    nodes made up of edges (e), junction nodes (n), and date nodes (s) are more straightforward
    to understand because of the laws of mass and energy conservation. The following
    is the continuity idea''s central idea: (8) In compact form, (9) This suggests
    that each junction node''s total inflows and outflows, and ⁠, should equal zero.
    q stands for edge rate, Q for external demand at the junction, and it stands for
    matrix incidence reduced to junction nodes. (10) According to the Law of Conservation
    of Energy, in a closed loop, the algebraic total of the head losses h must be
    zero, while in an open loop, the difference in the heads at each endpoint must
    be equal. As such, we can divide it up as follows: (11) For fundamental circuits,
    components are zero, as stated in Equation (11). It is a loop matrix. Edges can
    be distinct hydraulic characteristics with a recognized link between head loss
    and flow, as was already established. Head loss, denoted by the variable h, is
    shown here as a nonlinear function of flow rate. (12) Proposition 3 (Hydrostatic
    Models for Micro- and Macro-Scopy). Equations (1)–(7) describe the fundamental
    equations regulating water distribution networks and can be used to construct
    microscopic representations. These are comprehensive or standard recreation representations
    for the water distribution network, complete in that they include network topologies,
    well-defined nodes, and precise connection parameters (diameter, size, roughness).
    Nodal requirements must be calculated before usage. Macroscopic modeling, on the
    other hand, relies on empirical modeling methods. Information is created and maintained
    for significant flows and heads linked to network storage tanks and pumping stations.
    Macroscopic models are adequate for tackling practical and optimal control problems
    in water distribution networks. These could use data-driven techniques like regression
    models or artificial neural networks. Even if these models have significant differences,
    creating a conceptual representation of a water supply network in a discrete period
    is still possible. (13) Equation (13), in which y(o) stands for the state vector,
    illustrates this. Tank depth, pipe flow, and nodal pressure are a few signs of
    progress. The additional numbers provide more clarity than the l-state variables
    defining the o + 1 status variables. A vector control variable, V(o). Discharge,
    in the form of flow control valves, Outlet Pressure, and Pumping Station Pressure,
    are some of the controllable variables. The demand at each node in a network is
    spread out using a vector called r(o). The nonlinear network function portrays
    the stochastic disturbance as (o). The water management mathematical model''s
    flowchart is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Flow chart of
    water management. Proposition 4 (Hydraulic Transient Models). The following words
    can be used to depict the water distribution networks'' transient flow as water-hammer
    equations: In Equations (14) and (15), R stands for the pipe diameter, and t stands
    for gravitational acceleration. F stands for the hydraulic head, q for pipe flow,
    y for distance, s for speed, and g for friction factor. A signifies the pipe''s
    cross-sectional area, and a represents the wave speed. (14) (15) The features
    the approach can transform calculations (15) and (16) into a collection of normal
    difference reckonings along typical axes. (16) (17) where ds stands for time and
    dy for distance. The grid locations of the network receive temporary heads and
    concurrent flow as a result of the approximations to Equations (17) and (18).
    If initial and boundary conditions are given (based on acknowledged network heads
    and flows), the finite difference approach can be utilized to identify solutions.
    Inputs used in calculating the pipeline friction factor, or h, are the length,
    K, diameter, head loss, and flow rate. (18) Proposition 5 (Water Quality Models).
    The study of contaminant/disinfectant concentrations, simulating the water age,
    and maximizing operational water quality have all been appropriate for use in
    water distribution network representations. The location of the source impurities
    and the site for tracer studies have also been helpful. Organizations with expertise
    in hydraulics and water quality address water quality problems affecting the entire
    distribution system. These models are crucial for forecasting the direction and
    path of water quality along water distribution networks. Chemical or other material
    diffusion in water distribution networks is influenced by pipeline advection,
    node mixing, and kinetic response processes. The persistent emissions in the pipe
    will be modeled using a one-dimensional mass conservation difference computation.
    (19) In Equation (19), the concentration of pollutants in the pipeline is denoted
    by (C), where (A) is the transversal pipe area, (y) is the positively flowing
    pipe distance, (q) is the broad volumetric flow rate of the channel, and (C) is
    the reaction rate of the pipeline. It is possible to interpret changes in the
    contaminants’ focus using the first-order kinetic rate estimate in the following.
    (20) Equation (20), where C represents the bulk flow of pollutants, and o represents
    the first-order reaction rate coefficient, makes this observation clear. The coefficient
    is positive for operations that cause contaminants to increase, while it is harmful
    for activities that cause impurities to decrease. The mass balance principle can
    be used to determine the node mixing: (21) In Equation (21), the contaminated
    node O is represented by Co, and the network of pipes entering the system is represented
    by l. It is anticipated that active elements like pumps and valves will have identical
    amounts of contamination at the input and output (immediate advection of contaminants).
    The variable-level tank may display a reduction in pollutant levels. (22) Cin
    represents the level of contamination in the input pipe, and the reaction rate
    inside the tank is represented by θ′ (⁠⁠), as can be seen in Equation (22), where

    mixing of the nodes and tanks ought to facilitate the assessment of the water
    quality model. Computational fluid dynamics can be used to enhance the accuracy
    of additional types of mixing in water quality models. The mathematical model
    used in the SCADA approach may accurately predict when water demand will surge,
    needing increased or ideal water distribution network operations. Water distribution
    networks'' design, process, and management require water demand forecasting as
    a critical instrument. It is based on historical water consumption data, considering
    socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The limitations include evapotranspiration,
    temperature, season, family size, precipitation, water quality, etc. SCADA systems
    provide real-time visibility, control, and data analysis capabilities that enable
    water treatment operators to monitor and optimize processes, detect, and respond
    to anomalies, and make data-driven decisions. By leveraging SCADA systems, water
    treatment operations can achieve higher efficiency, reduced operational costs,
    improved asset utilization, and enhanced overall performance. This study shows
    that big data analytics, the IoT, data collection, and supervisory control can
    be used to implement novel water management. Hybrid strategies based on substitution
    models can be applied to managing water distribution networks. These models are
    used to simulate the performance of water distribution networks using computer
    software. For single- and multi-objective optimization problems, hybrid algorithms
    provide optimal global solutions with fewer function assessments. Using various
    methods, the researchers pinpointed the conduits that boosted single-cycle background
    leakage flow. Therefore, a multi-periodic leakage stream investigation will result
    in more helpful information. Water treatment facilities can achieve better control,
    monitoring, and management by integrating IoT and SCADA systems. This integration
    enhances data collection, enables real-time visibility, supports predictive maintenance,
    optimizes resource allocation, facilitates centralized data analysis, automates
    workflows, and ensures scalability. Ultimately, it leads to improved operational
    efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced system performance, and better overall management
    of water treatment facilities. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Hardware implementation
    Listen The ESP8266 module, Arduino UNO, Ultrasonic sensor, and ThingSpeak server
    are used to implement this prototype. The hierarchical structure of hardware architecture
    places sensors, actuators, and Ardino UNO as control units and end devices, respectively.
    IoT is used for system communication. An ultrasonic sensor is fixed to the tank''s
    top. We use the ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in the tank. We regularly
    check the ultrasonic sensor reading and monitor the ultrasonic sensor''s status
    by measuring the distance between the top of the tank and the water''s surface.
    Start the water pump motor if there is water in the tank. A flow sensor is employed
    to measure the water flow rate through the pipe. When the flow rate exceeds the
    threshold, the water pump motor shuts off automatically. The Arduino UNO microcontroller
    is used to control all of these processes. These data were updated in the thing
    talk server using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The platform is open-source. The data
    received and stored on the talk server can be continuously tracked. Here are some
    essential concerns for the scalability and practicality of applying the proposed
    system in real-world scenarios. Cost-effectiveness: Cost is a significant factor
    in large-scale deployments. Research should focus on developing cost-effective
    solutions that can be scaled up without incurring prohibitive expenses. To do
    this, it may be necessary to investigate accessible sensor technologies, utilize
    existing infrastructure when possible, and optimize the data gathering and management
    procedures. Scalability: Any water monitoring system designed for widespread use
    should be scalable to support a variety of monitoring locations. As the deployment
    expands, the system''s architecture and design should make adding new sensors
    and monitoring sites simple. To achieve seamless integration across the monitoring
    network, interoperability, and standardized communication protocols should be
    considered. Infrastructure Compatibility: To support the system''s operations,
    large-scale deployments need compatible infrastructure. The current infrastructure,
    including communication networks and data storage capacities, must be evaluated
    to see if any upgrades or alterations are required. To guarantee widespread adoption,
    compatibility with various types of infrastructure, including urban, rural, and
    distant places, should be considered. Research in water monitoring systems can
    significantly impact practical implementations and assist in overcoming challenges
    related to large-scale deployments when considering these practical implications,
    including cost-effectiveness, scalability, infrastructure compatibility, power
    supply, data management, long-term sustainability, and stakeholder engagement.
    Challenges Listen Various issues arise in IoT-based water monitoring technologies.
    The key issues with IoT-based water monitoring technologies are covered in this
    section. Five significant problems have been found in the literature: water contamination,
    water management, agricultural management, conventional monitoring techniques,
    restricted water supplies, and population growth. Limitations Listen Identification
    was difficult even though the database sources employed for the presented inquiry
    were numerous and reliable. The escalating progress in this region further affected
    the review''s timeframe. Studies on a vital topic conducted at a specific time
    frequently do not accurately reflect the influence or application. But the information
    shows how the academic world has reacted to the issue. Technology related Listen
    It is essential to create flexible, modular, expandable, and simple structures
    for people to erect. Future research should focus on enhancing real-time monitoring
    systems, including notifications and social media alerts. A mobile app is also
    advised to monitor red tides and scan the water''s color using image processing
    (Dasig 2019). The method described by the authors in Narayanan et al. (2020) could
    be supplemented by creating a software agent-based model for underground pipe
    health and consumption monitoring that uses intelligent agents to inform the SCADA
    engineer for prompt control action and supply restoration. This intelligent agent
    would automate control during crucial times as a safeguard. The authors recommended
    concentrating on (Danh et al. 2020) assessing and enhancing measuring practices
    to increase the sensor probes'' service life. It is anticipated that a future
    machine learning technique could be created to evaluate the various physical properties
    of water and accurately predict the location of a water source that has undergone
    a sudden and abnormal change in water quality, according to speculation by the
    authors cited in Lalithadevi et al. (2019). This development may be beneficial
    in detecting and stopping the pollution or intrusion of dangerous compounds into
    water sources. To do this, the authors of Elijah et al. (2018) recommend that
    future research efforts concentrate on developing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
    tailored explicitly for river water quality sampling. These UAVs must consider
    river size, power consumption, payload capacity, and flight limits. For improved
    data transfer, scientists suggest using UAVs fitted with LPWA (Low Power Wide
    Area) communication technology. The significant impact of the load will raise
    interest in using tiny smart multi-parameter sensors for WQ, which will lead to
    further research on implementing a service composition algorithm with network
    awareness and several criteria. Performance measure Listen The following measures
    are employed to assess the model''s performance. Security level analysis Listen
    Smart IoT-based water treatment security refers to the procedures and processes
    to secure the system and its connected devices from unauthorized access, data
    breaches, and malicious actions. Encryption, authentication, access limits, and
    regular monitoring protect the water treatment infrastructure and critical data.
    High security protects the intelligent IoT-based water treatment process''s functioning,
    data, and privacy. Figure 5 and Table 1 compare the IoT–SCADA strategy''s security
    level with other recent technologies. The graph shows how the performance of the
    IoT approach has increased while keeping a high level of security. For instance,
    the IoT–SCADA model''s security level with 100 data is 93.795%, compared to security
    levels of 84.763, 89.762, 70.865, and 73.876% for the Sewage Wastewater Treatment
    Systems (SWTS), Sewage Wastewater Farm Green (SWFG), IoT-Sewage Treatment Monitoring
    System (IoT-STMS), and Smart Farm-Scale Piggery Wastewater Treatment System (SFS-PWT)
    models, respectively. The IoT–SCADA model has, however, demonstrated its better
    performance with various data sizes. The security level for the IoT–SCADA is 95.484%
    under 300 data, compared to the values of 82.937, 91.641, 71.865, and 76.467%
    for the SWTS, IoT-STMS, IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT models, respectively. Table 1 Security

    IoT-based water treatment system in a specific time is known as the flow rate.
    It shows how fast IoT-enabled gadgets and technology clean water. Water treatment
    is optimized, and water quality is maintained by monitoring and adjusting the
    flow rate. Comparative Flow rate Detection analysis of the IoT–SCADA methodology
    with other techniques is shown in Figure 6 and Table 2. The IoT–SCADA model''s
    flow rate detection value at 50 psi is 39.571GPM, compared to the flow rate values
    of 28.234 GPM, 35.772 GPM, 33.433 GPM, and 25.455 GPM for SWTS, SWFG, IoT-STMS,
    and SFS-PWT, respectively. The IoT-OTT model has, however, demonstrated its better
    performance with various data sizes. Similarly, the Flow rate Detection value
    for the IoT–SCADA model under 250 psi is 41.894GPM, compared to the models for
    SWTS, SWFG, IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT, which have values of 32.987 GPM, 38.548 GPM,
    36.584 GPM, and 28.098 GPM, respectively. Table 2 Flow rate analysis for IoT–SCADA

    Route failure rate analysis Listen The route failure rate for an intelligent IoT-based
    water treatment system is the frequency at which data or signals fail to transmit
    between system components. It evaluates information-transporting sensors, actuators,
    controllers, and communication networks. Data loss, delays, and disruptions may
    cause water treatment process inefficiencies or failures if route failure rates
    are significant. The Route failure rate comparison of the IoT–SCADA approach with
    other methods in use is explained in Table 3 and Figure 7. The data unambiguously
    demonstrates that, in contrast to the different techniques, the suggested way
    has the lowest route failure rate. For instance, the recommended method''s Route
    failure rate with 100 data is 46.365%, compared to SWTS, SWFG, IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT''s
    of 54.765, 63.548, 56.764, and 60.657%, respectively. The IoT–SCADA technique
    performs better with a lower Route failure rate. On the other hand, approaches
    like SWTS, SWFG, IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT have a Route failure rate of 55.864, 63.548,
    58.754, and 63.278%, respectively, whereas the suggested method has a Route failure
    rate of 49.303% with 500 data. Table 3 Route failure rate analysis for IoT–SCADA

    an innovative IoT-based water treatment system quantifies how efficiently it uses
    resources and energy to treat water. It compares clean, safe water to power, chemicals,
    and operational costs. A more excellent efficiency ratio shows that the water
    treatment system is performing ideally, minimizing resource waste, and efficiently
    attaining treatment results. This ratio is usually estimated by comparing the
    amount of treated water generated to the total resources consumed during treatment.
    In Figure 8 and Table 4, an efficiency ratio comparison of the IoT–SCADA strategy
    with other existing technologies is displayed. The graph shows how the IoT strategy
    has increased performance while preserving high efficiency. For instance, the
    IoT–SCADA model''s Efficiency ratio with 100 data is 95.39%, compared to Efficiency
    ratio of 70.34, 59.43, 88.43, and 62.43% for the SWTS, SWFG, IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT
    models, respectively. The IoT–SCADA model has, however, demonstrated its better
    performance with various data sizes. The Efficiency ratio for the IoT–SCADA is
    96.43% under 300 data, compared to the values of 73.67, 62.01, 91.68, and 66.32%

    IoT-based water treatment involves monitoring and analyzing water parameters and
    contaminants to ensure cleanliness, safety, and applicability. This uses IoT technology
    to capture real-time data on pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and
    hazardous compounds. The collected data optimizes the water treatment, identifies
    faults, and ensures safe, high-quality drinking water. Comparative Water Quality
    Detection analysis of the IoT–SCADA approach with other techniques is shown in
    Figure 9 and Table 5. The figure demonstrates that the IoT strategy has improved
    performance in water quality detection. For instance, the IoT–SCADA model''s water
    quality detection value at 10 min was 50.879 mg/I, compared to the SWTS, SWFG,
    IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT models'' values of 44.766, 47.532, 39.263, and 41.287 mg/me,
    respectively. The IoT–SCADA model has, however, demonstrated its better performance
    with various data sizes. Similarly, the Water Quality Detection value for IoT–SCADA
    under 50 min is 54.165 mg/I, compared to SWTS, SWFG, IoT-STMS, and SFS-PWT models,
    which have values of 44.322, 51.675, 40.235, and 43.275 mg/I, respectively. Table

    treatment system''s Leakage Detection Ratio measures its ability to find and quantify
    infrastructure leaks. It tests the system''s IoT technologies and algorithms for
    water leak detection. A valuable measure for evaluating the effectiveness of the
    novel water treatment solution in reducing water loss and ensuring efficient operation
    is the ratio of precisely identified leaks to the total number of leaks. Figure
    10 and Table 6 compare the IoT–SCADA strategy''s Leakage Detection ratio to other
    current technologies. The graph shows how the performance of the IoT strategy
    has increased while retaining a high level of leakage detection. For instance,
    the IoT–SCADA model''s Leakage Detection ratio with 100 data is 96.54%, compared
    to Leakage Detection ratio of 76.27, 65.78, 86.21, and 79.98% for the SWTS, SWFG,

    a web-based SCADA platform that is of low cost, highly flexible, platform-agnostic,
    and modular. During the Industry 4.0 era, the SCADA platform was created using
    IoT concepts. An IoT–SCADA system can be implemented at various wastewater collection
    and treatment phases. An IoT-enabled intelligent water sensor maps water flow
    across the whole treatment plant by measuring pressure, temperature, pressure
    dynamics, and water quality. The suggested method ensures that chemical discharges
    do not exceed permitted limits while estimating the efficacy of the effluent treatment
    facility. In addition, CEP can evaluate and process the massive influx of data
    sets produced in real-time by IoT sensors. In addition, the system analyses the
    collected data and generates valuable insights using cutting-edge techniques for
    data analytics. These insights can aid in optimizing the treatment process, identifying
    potential problems, and making decisions regarding system maintenance and enhancement.
    In addition, integrating IoT and SCADA enables the system to automate particular
    operations, thereby reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing operational
    efficiency. The SFS-PWT, SWTS, and IoT-STMS are some of the models used in this
    study. The numerical outcomes of the suggested strategy demonstrate a security
    improvement (95.484%), efficiency (96.43%), and leakage detection (98.56%). Future
    research that incorporates all of these crucial factors and makes use of IoT-based
    predictions to increase the efficiency of the smart management system is what
    we recommend. Future studies can also use the IoT coverage factor to calculate
    measurement uncertainty. The authors recommend further research and fresh research
    partnerships to enhance IoT security, limit biological influence, use artificial
    intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) techniques, and lower system costs. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

  analysis: 'The systematic review on automated systems for real-time irrigation management
    can be interpreted as follows:


    **Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)** and
    **their collection and use**

    Soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather are important data types for irrigation
    management. Automated systems can collect this data using sensors and use it to
    make informed decisions about when and how much to irrigate. This can lead to
    more efficient use of water and increased crop yields.


    **Challenges (e.g., data quality, scalability, reliability, and security)**

    One of the challenges of using automated irrigation systems is ensuring the quality,
    scalability, reliability, and security of the data. Data quality issues can include
    missing or inaccurate data, which can lead to poor decision-making. Scalability
    issues can arise as the system is expanded to larger areas or more complex crops.
    Reliability issues can occur if the system is not properly maintained or if there
    are power outages. Security issues can arise if the system is not properly protected
    from unauthorized access.


    **Data collection to cloud: automation and real-time processing: Focuses on the
    initial stages of the automated irrigation management pipeline, covering data
    collection, edge and fog computing, real-time data transmission protocols and
    technologies, and the challenges and solutions associated with real-time data
    transmission.**

    The initial stages of the automated irrigation management pipeline involve collecting
    data from sensors, transmitting it to the cloud, and processing it in real time.
    This can be a challenging task, as the data can be large and complex, and it needs
    to be processed quickly in order to make informed decisions about irrigation.
    However, there are a number of technologies and techniques that can be used to
    overcome these challenges and ensure that the data is collected, transmitted,
    and processed efficiently and effectively.


    **Processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action: Emphasizes the
    importance of data processing, analysis, and decision-making in the automated
    irrigation management pipeline, highlighting the role of machine learning and
    deep learning algorithms in these processes, and discussing the challenges associated
    with implementing these algorithms.**

    Once the data has been collected and transmitted to the cloud, it needs to be
    processed, analyzed, and used to make decisions about irrigation. This can be
    a complex task, as the data can be large and complex, and it needs to be processed
    quickly in order to make informed decisions about irrigation. However, there are
    a number of machine learning and deep learning algorithms that can be used to
    automate these tasks and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the decision-making
    process.


    **Highlighting the role of interoperability and standardization: The review seeks
    to emphasize the importance of interoperability and standardization in enabling
    the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline,
    exploring existing and emerging standards and their applicability to real-time
    irrigation management systems.**

    Interoperability and standardization are important for enabling the integration
    of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. This is because
    they ensure that the different components can communicate with each other and
    share data in a consistent and reliable manner. There are a number of existing
    and emerging standards that can be used to achieve interoperability and standardization
    in automated irrigation management systems. These standards include the ISO 11783
    standard for agricultural data exchange, the OGC SensorThings API standard for
    sensor data management, and the IEEE 1451 standard for smart sensors. By using
    these standards, system designers and integrators can ensure that their components
    are interoperable and can be easily integrated into automated irrigation management
    systems.


    **Identifying challenges and proposing solutions: The review aims to uncover the
    challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems,
    such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, and proposes solutions
    and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations.**

    There are a number of challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated
    irrigation systems. These challenges include data quality, scalability, reliability,
    and security. In this review, we identify these challenges and propose solutions
    and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations.
    By addressing these challenges, system designers and integrators can ensure that
    their systems are reliable, scalable, and secure, and that they can deliver the
    benefits of automated irrigation to farmers and growers.


    **Guiding future research and innovation: By identifying research gaps and proposing
    new research questions and hypotheses, the review aims to provide a roadmap for
    advancing the field of real-time, automated irrigation management.**

    This review provides a roadmap for advancing the field of real-time, automated
    irrigation management. We identify research gaps and propose new research questions
    and hypotheses that can be used to guide future research and innovation. By addressing
    these research gaps, researchers can develop new technologies and techniques that
    will improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation systems and
    make them more accessible to farmers and growers.


    **In summary, this systematic review on automated systems for real-time irrigation
    management provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art and
    identifies challenges and opportunities for future research and innovation. The
    review will be of interest to researchers, system designers, integrators, and
    farmers and growers who are interested in using automated irrigation systems to
    improve the efficiency of water use and increase crop yields.**'

    \ (Y.B.)\nAbstract: In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution (Industry 4.0),\nwhere the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing,\
    \ computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved\nexponentially on a large scale.\
    \ The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms\ngenerate\
    \ enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security.\
    \ Arti-\nﬁcial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods\
    \ for addressing cybersecurity\nthreats and providing security. In this study,\
    \ we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that\ncategorize, map and survey\
    \ the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks\n\
    in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation\
    \ on most AI trending\ntechniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions.\
    \ A systematic search was performed on various\nelectronic databases (SCOPUS,\
    \ Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out\nof the identiﬁed\
    \ records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed\
    \ and\ncarefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine\
    \ learning (ML) tech-\nniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in\
    \ detecting attacks. However, several studies\nhave proposed smart intrusion detection\
    \ systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks\nusing AI to overcome\
    \ the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector\n\
    machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to\
    \ high accuracy\ndetection another reason may be efﬁcient memory. In addition,\
    \ other methods also provide better\nperformance such as extreme gradient boosting\
    \ (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent\nneural networks (RNN). This analysis\
    \ also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats\nbased on attack\
    \ categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.\n\

    \ (IoT) in recent years has contributed\nto a signiﬁcant increase in fog computing,\
    \ smart cities, and Industry 4.0, all of which\nexecute the complex data processing\
    \ of conﬁdential information that must be protected\nagainst cybersecurity attacks.\
    \ Cybersecurity attacks have increased rapidly in various\ndomains, such as smart\
    \ homes, healthcare, energy, agriculture, automation, and industrial\nprocesses\
    \ [1]. As a result of their wide range of services, IoT device sensors generate\
    \ large\namounts of data that requires authentication, security, and privacy.\
    \ Previously, traditional\nmethods and frameworks were used to ensure the security\
    \ of IoT. However, the application\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11020198\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n2 of 27\n\
    of different artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) methods for detecting cybersecurity attacks\
    \ has\ngained in popularity over the years.\nIoT comprises interconnected devices\
    \ that are increasingly developed on a large scale,\ntaking into account various\
    \ characteristics through cloud and fog computing, where the\nprocessing of real-time\
    \ applications can be enhanced [2]. Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are\nintegrated\
    \ technologies such as healthcare IoT, industrial IoT (IIoT), smart cities IoT,\
    \ AI and big\ndata, that are part of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry\
    \ 4.0), and are used for innovation\nin smart industries to promote data transmission\
    \ between networks [3,4]. To overcome the\nsecurity issues that threaten the IoT,\
    \ several researchers have developed IDSs based on various\nAI approaches. Kurte\
    \ et al. [5], for example, introduced a distributed service framework that\nsupports\
    \ the development of trustworthiness and privacy protection for multidirectional\n\
    data aggregation for edge computing enhancement [6]. Diro and Chilamkurti [7]\
    \ proposed a\ndetection system using deep learning (DL) methods to detect cybersecurity\
    \ attacks in IoT. They\ncompared the DL model with traditional machine learning\
    \ (ML) approaches. Farivar et al. [8]\nidentified AI for the detection of malicious\
    \ attacks in CPS and IIoT and proposed a hybrid\nintelligent classic control approach\
    \ for the reconstruction of cyberattacks on the input data of\nnon-linear CPS\
    \ through shared networks.\nSecurity in the IoT requires additional considerations\
    \ to protect connected smart\ndevices from threats and other vulnerabilities using\
    \ effective AI techniques towards moni-\ntoring [9–11]. In addition, IoT security\
    \ systems are designed using AI enhanced encryption\nalgorithms to archive privacy\
    \ [12,13]. For example, Obaidat et al. [14] investigated in-depth\nIoT attacks,\
    \ threats and vulnerability through classiﬁcation based on severity impact, also\n\
    providing a multi-faceted method to countermeasure those security concerns. Li\
    \ et al. [15]\nproposed a novel privacy prevention of ML training with classiﬁcation\
    \ process through a\nsecurity framework based on a homomorphic encryption scheme\
    \ over a matrix ring, which\nalso supports ciphertexts homomorphic comparison.\
    \ Sarica and Angin [16] provided ex-\nplainable security in IoT networks by proposing\
    \ a real-time automated intrusion detection\napproach using ML classiﬁers in software-deﬁned\
    \ networking (SDN) application layer to\ndetect an attack. Aleem et al. [17] provide\
    \ security concerns for data warehouse (DWH)\nwith each type of security approach.\
    \ Furthermore, it includes a new and unique CPS if the\ncountermeasure is insufﬁcient\
    \ [18]. Patil et al. [19] proposed a virtual machine-assisted\nlightweight agent-based\
    \ malware detection framework for securing a virtual machine in\ncloud computing,\
    \ while, Dang et al. [20] proposed an authentication method for securing\ncloud\
    \ servers in IoT environments. In addition, Moustafa [21] proposed a new IoT network\n\
    distributed architecture using an AI-based security system.\nOwing to their IDSs,\
    \ AI methods are widely used for providing security to IoT devices\nand networks\
    \ to overcome the challenges, security issues and abnormalities [22]. Recent\n\
    studies by Ghosh et al. [23] claimed that the application of AI in IoT is a breakthrough\n\
    for reducing human effort in providing security. More recent evidence was reported\
    \ by\nBland et al. [24]; they proposed ML cyberattack and defense strategies using\
    \ reinforcement\nlearning algorithms to improve the ability to detect cybersecurity\
    \ attacks. Rathore and\nPark [25] used a semi-supervised learning-based distribution\
    \ attack detection framework\nfor IoT, where they introduced a fog-based attack\
    \ detection framework and proposed an\nextreme learning machine (ELM)-based semi-supervised\
    \ fuzzy method to achieve adequate\ngeneralization performance at a fast detection\
    \ rate. Kasongo and Sun [26] adopted a\nDL method and developed an approach for\
    \ wireless IDS using wrapper-based feature\nextraction for wireless networks based\
    \ on a feed-forward deep neural network.\nHowever, certain limitations exist because\
    \ the use of AI in cybersecurity detection\nintroduces considerable exposure to\
    \ IoT devices and networks. In addition to the develop-\nment of IoT, several\
    \ centralized attack detection mechanisms have been proposed to detect\nattacks\
    \ in the IoT using a supervised ML algorithm. In spite of this, these mechanisms\
    \ have\nfailed to achieve signiﬁcant results because of the distinct requirements\
    \ of devices, such\nas scalability and distribution, [25]. However, there’s a\
    \ need for IoT security guidelines\nto evaluate the existing methods [27]. Previous\
    \ systematic reviews have made signiﬁcant\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n3 of 27\n\
    contributions to the cybersecurity ﬁeld. The work of [28] investigated and analyzed\
    \ the\nimportance of artiﬁcial immune systems in IoT environments by evaluating\
    \ and identifying\nthe performance of empirical research on the approaches to\
    \ secure IoT environments.\nIn this review, we intend to explore and analyze both\
    \ ML and DL methods used for\nthe detection of cybersecurity attacks in IoT devices\
    \ and networks by formulating and\naddressing research questions, and ﬁlling the\
    \ current research gaps in the area of IoT\nsecurity by attempting to overcome\
    \ limitations in the existing work.\nIDSs, particularly those designed using AI\
    \ such as anomaly-based, are preferred for\ndetecting cybersecurity attacks in\
    \ mobile devices with integrity veriﬁcation schemes for\ncloud storage in an endpoint\
    \ environment [2,29–31]. In this study, we analyze the research\npublished on\
    \ IoT security and identify the best possible solutions under different scenarios,\n\
    including detection algorithms, frameworks, architectures, and models. Previously,\
    \ arti-\nﬁcial immune systems have been reviewed to secure IoT via fog orchestration\
    \ [28,32–34].\nHerein, we mapped the literature to identify past learnings and\
    \ discuss potential future\nscenarios. To this end, we formulated three research\
    \ questions.\nThis SLR (systematic literature review) consists of ten sections\
    \ and is organized as\nfollows. Section 1 introduction, Section 2 provides metasurvey,\
    \ Section 3 presents survey\nmethodology, Section 4 presents results, Section\
    \ 5 presents SLR major ﬁndings based on the\nresearch questions, Section 6 presents\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence roadmap, Section 7 presents a\ndiscussion, Section 8\
    \ presents limitations of the study, Section 9 presents recommendations\nfor future\
    \ investigations and Section 10 is the conclusion.\n1.1. Huge Network Trafﬁc Dataset\
    \ and Imbalanced Dataset\nIoT IDSs using AI have challenges of the huge amount\
    \ of datasets from network trafﬁc\nwhich leads to high false alarm and low detection\
    \ rates [35]. This can be addressed using\nfeature reduction technique. Singh\
    \ et al. [35] proposed a technique for IDS based on online\nsequential extreme\
    \ ML which proﬁling less time complexity while irrelevant features are\nexcluded\
    \ using correlation, consistency feature selection. Figure 1 show data imbalanced\n\
    problem from multi-classes relationship between more complex and classes. In addition,\n\
    the ML IDSs face challenges due to imbalanced datasets when processing/training\
    \ entire\ndata, while this can be addressed by identiﬁcation of intrusion through\
    \ network trafﬁc\nbehavior and reassembling imbalanced datasets.\nFigure 1. Two\
    \ possible class imbalance scenarios: (left) binary imbalanced problem and (right)\n\
    multi-class imbalanced problem [36].\n1.2. Research Contribution\nSeveral research\
    \ studies address the importance of AI in IoT cybersecurity. In this\nstudy, we\
    \ investigate the use of AI methods in the detection of a cybersecurity attack\
    \ in the\nIoT. The research contribution for this SLR includes the following:\n\
    •\nWe formulate and answer three research questions using existing empirical studies\n\
    that use AI methods in IoT.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n4 of 27\n•\nWe review\
    \ the current uses of AI methods in detecting IoT threats by evaluating the\n\
    approach using datasets.\n•\nWe present a classiﬁcation of studies based on ML\
    \ Algorithms, DL algorithms, model\nperformance, IDSs and types of threats.\n\
    •\nWe also discuss the limitations of the study and recommendations for future\
    \ studies.\n2. Metasurvey\nIn this section, related works have been reviewed based\
    \ on literature review studies.\nThe existing studies related to AI algorithm-based\
    \ technique has been used to detect cyber-\nattacks and anomaly activities in\
    \ IoT nowadays, through developing smart, secure and\nprovide, IoT infrastructure\
    \ which can detect the abnormal, vulnerability from cyber-attack\nautomatically,\
    \ the ML, DL algorithms was the best to protect the systems than normal\ntraditional\
    \ method when it is in an abnormal state. For such reason, the goal is to identify\n\
    what are the most effective AI methods to detect an attack, threats in IoT environment\n\
    and investigate the available practice to reduce those attacks using effective\
    \ techniques. In\naddition, IoT is subjected to serious risk of cyber security\
    \ attack due to its huge amount of\ndata generated through the network and communication\
    \ layers of ﬁeld devices such as\nsensor data and actuators which are usually\
    \ used for real-time monitoring and predictions.\nAhmad et al. [37] conducted\
    \ a comprehensive analysis of different DL models which\ninclude CNN, RNN, LSTM\
    \ using IoT-Botnet 2020 dataset to propose an efﬁcient anomaly\ndetection using\
    \ mutual information (MI) by considering deep neural network (DNN) for\nan IoT\
    \ network. Similar study by Ali and Choi [38] presents a comprehensive review\n\
    on state-of-art AI techniques for distributed smart grids with aims to support\
    \ the inte-\ngration of renewable energy resources security. Tahsien et al. [39]\
    \ present a survey of\nML-based solutions for IoT security in terms of different\
    \ types of possible attacks. Alsouﬁ\net al. [40] present a review analysis on\
    \ anomaly-based intrusion detection systems in IoT\nusing several DL techniques.\
    \ Echeverría et al. [41] investigated in-depth on cybersecurity\nmodel based on\
    \ hardening to secure IoT using a model of sequence consist seven steps\nto minimize\
    \ the attack surface through executing hardening processing. However, new\nconcern\
    \ about cybersecurity issues are rising in IoT infrastructure Djenna et al. [42]\
    \ presents\na critical analysis of the most recent cybersecurity issues for IoT-based\
    \ critical infrastruc-\ntures. Another progressive research on IoT security by\
    \ Mahbub [43] presents an exhaustive\nanalysis based on perspective protocols,\
    \ vulnerabilities and preemptive architectonics.\nThis review focuses on AI techniques\
    \ used between 2016 and 2021. However, before\n2016, AI has played a role in cybersecurity.\
    \ The dominant techniques during this time\ninclude genetic algorithms, fuzzy\
    \ logic and neural networks where many researchers\nproposed IDSs and intelligence\
    \ architecture frameworks based on AI. For example, in\n2015, Dilek et al. [44]\
    \ provided a comprehensive review on AI techniques to combat\ncybercrimes with\
    \ efﬁcient methods for detecting and preventing cyber-attacks. In addition,\n\
    Greensmith [45] provided how artiﬁcial immune systems (AIS) can maintain and secure\
    \ IoT\nnetworks using advanced AIS. Moreover, the authors provide its challenges\
    \ and limitations.\nIn 2011, Morel [46] provided a broad overview of AI as a feature\
    \ of cybersecurity based on\nits different approaches.\nTable 1 shows comparison\

    \ Intelligence’ OR ‘Machine Learning’ OR ‘Deep Learning’ OR ‘AI’ OR ‘ML’\nOR ‘DL’\
    \ AND ‘Cybersecurity’ OR ‘Attacks’ OR ‘Threats’ AND ‘IoT’ OR ‘CPS’ ‘Industrial\n\
    IoT’ OR ‘Medical IoT’ OR ‘Energy IoT’ AND ‘Detection’ OR ‘Prediction’ OR ‘Identiﬁcation’\n\
    OR ‘Detect’. All searches spanned the period from the inception of the database\
    \ until 2021\nand included journal articles with a few review papers published\
    \ only in English.\n3.5. Eligibility Criteria\nThe search was primarily focused\
    \ on the mapping of existing literature on Internet\nsecurity and ML security\
    \ in the ﬁelds of computer science, decision science, and mathe-\nmatics. The\
    \ search covered the years 2016 to 2021; all articles published before 2016 were\n\
    excluded from the search. Moreover, the search was performed on a global level\
    \ and not\nrestricted to a speciﬁc country or region. At this stage, 72 research\
    \ articles were excluded,\nand the 80 selected research articles were extracted.\
    \ Table 3 summarizes the inclusion and\nexclusion criteria used in selecting the\
    \ research articles.\nTable 3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion\n\

    3.6. Quality Assessment\nQuality assessment was based on original research and\
    \ a few review articles. To\nmaintain the quality of the review, all duplicate\
    \ records were thoroughly checked. In\nparticular, the abstracts of all research\
    \ articles included in the review process were checked\nin detail and ﬁltered\
    \ to ensure their quality and relevance. A careful evaluation of each\nresearch\
    \ paper was performed at a later stage. Another exclusion criterion was to limit\
    \ the\narticles to those published in the English language. Consequently, six\
    \ articles in non-English\nlanguages were excluded from the study.\n3.7. Data\
    \ Extraction\nSelected studies were placed into a data extraction spreadsheet\
    \ using Microsoft Excel\n2019. The data extracted from the studies were: author(s),\
    \ year, AI type, algorithm used,\nperformance focus, model performance, number\
    \ of predictive features, types of cybersecu-\nrity attacks and data sources.\
    \ The data extraction was performed by two authors of this\nstudy (N.A. and S.J.A).\n\
    4. Results\nIn this section, we summarize the results of the screening and search\
    \ processes based\non the PRISMA guidelines. First, we describe the characteristics\
    \ of selected research studies\nby presenting their data quantitatively, which\

    \ Summary of Studies Classiﬁed Based on ML Algorithms\nTable 4 summarizes the\
    \ classiﬁcation of the studies based on ML algorithms used in\nthe detection of\
    \ IoT threats. The table includes article authors, year, description of their\n\
    work, datasets, and ML algorithms used. ML methods are the most promising for\
    \ ensuring\nsecurity within the IoT environment, whereas framework models, IDSs,\
    \ techniques, and\nintelligent architectures have been proposed by various researchers\
    \ to detect threats and\nattacks in IoT devices and fog-based systems. According\
    \ to the summary of studies,\nSVM, SVR, DT, RF, NB classiﬁer, LR, KNN, and fuzzy\
    \ algorithms are commonly used to\naddress cybersecurity-related issues. The ML\
    \ algorithms were categorized into supervised,\nunsupervised, and semi-supervised\
    \ learning-based methods. Furthermore, certain studies\ncombined different methods\
    \ to compare their performances, which are referred to as\nintelligent hybrid\
    \ models.\n4.2.2. Summary of Studies Classiﬁed Based on DL Algorithms\nTable 5\
    \ summarizes the classiﬁcation of the studies based on the DL algorithms\nused\
    \ in the detection. The table includes article authors, year, description, datasets,\
    \ and\nDL algorithms used. DL is a subsection of ML that is based on a neural\
    \ network and\nplays a vital role in cybersecurity within the IoT environment.\
    \ Most researchers have\nproposed smart IDSs, framework models, techniques, intelligent\
    \ architectures, and fog-\nbased methods to detect threats in the identiﬁcation\
    \ systems of IoT devices and networks.\nAccording to the selected studies, most\
    \ researchers used deep autoencoders (DA), recurrent\nneural networks (RNN), convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNN), deep neural networks\n(DNN), multi-layer perception neural\
    \ networks, and deep belief networks (DBN) to address\ncybersecurity issues. Certain\
    \ studies combined different DL models to compare their\nperformances, which are\
    \ referred to as hybrid models. Additionally, most studies’ datasets\nare KDD,\
    \ which has limitations due to it being outdated in the IDS community.\nElectronics\

    \ trafﬁc categorization\n5. Major Findings Based on the Research Questions\n5.1.\
    \ RQ1: What Are the Existing Cybersecurity Attacks and Threats in the IoT Environment?\n\
    To identify the existing cybersecurity attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities in\
    \ IoT (RQ1),\nour study conﬁrmed the existence of DoS, DDoS, malicious, ransomware,\
    \ blackhole, sink-\nhole, reconnaissance, and wormhole attacks (Table 7) in IoT\
    \ environments. Additionally,\nWang et al. [62] proposed a network attack detection\
    \ model of power grid disturbances to\nidentify cyberattacks. Rathore and Park\
    \ [25] introduced fog-based attack detection consid-\nering the attack categories\
    \ of the IoT ecosystem, namely DoS, probe, user-to-root (U2R),\nand remote-to-local\
    \ (R2L) attacks. Dovom et al. [61] introduced ransomware and malware\nattack detection\
    \ in IoT. Li et al. [60] evaluated the performance of false alarm reduction to\n\
    enhance collaborative intrusion detection in IoT environments, and Azmoodeh et\
    \ al. [68]\nproposed non-malicious applications to detect ransomware by monitoring\
    \ the energy\nconsumption patterns based on the power consumption of Android devices.\
    \ Furthermore,\nour study explores IoT security by identifying existing features\
    \ and fault identiﬁcation,\nwhich are a vulnerability of IoT that leads to unreliable\
    \ network and data communication.\nVulnerabilities in IoT are increasing rapidly\
    \ owing to the complexity of network trafﬁc,\nthe addition of network communication\
    \ protocols, weak credentials, privacy, and insecure\nnetworks. Additionally,\
    \ Diro and Chilamkurti [7] reported unauthorized access to local\nuser accounts\
    \ and a spy breaking into the system to obtain conﬁdential information as\nvulnerabilities\
    \ in the IoT with internet message access protocol (IMAP); these attacks can\n\
    be categorized as R2L. Rashid et al. [70] added that vulnerabilities can occur\
    \ through\nzero-day attacks by exploiting different protocols in the IoT. Therefore,\
    \ when vulnerable\ndata/information leaks are subjected to cybersecurity threats,\
    \ the IoT becomes compro-\nmised by providing false results that lead to a sophisticated\
    \ attack. Lastly, Table 8 illustrates\nthe types of attacks within the IoT environment.\n\

    \ Attacks in the IoT?\nWe believe that support vector machines (SVM) and random\
    \ forest (RF) are mostly\nused because of high accuracy detection another reason\
    \ may be efﬁcient memory. The\nstudy [58,59,61,63–66,68–70] used SVM and RF due\
    \ to their classiﬁers effectiveness. They\nare widely implemented in various domains\
    \ such as anomaly intrusion detection systems\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n17 of\
    \ 27\nin IoT environments because of their most efﬁcient features from others\
    \ ML algorithms\ntowards identiﬁcation of attacks with better performance. In\
    \ addition, they are used for\nfeature selection techniques to achieve high accuracy\
    \ performance. However, they have\nlimitations such as long CPU time from SVM\
    \ and ineffective real-time predictions from\nRF. The studies from Alrashdi et\
    \ al. [67] used the random forest method to propose a\nsystem for anomaly detection\
    \ in IoT (AD-IoT), and Rahman et al. [58] used a support vector\nmachine to address\
    \ the limitations of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices.\nThey proposed\
    \ two techniques, namely semi-distributed and distributed, which combine\nhigh-performance\
    \ feature extraction and selection with potential fog-edge coordinated\nanalytics.\
    \ Furthermore, DL methods based on artiﬁcial neural networks are commonly\nused\
    \ for cybersecurity detection (Table 5).\nIn addition, we find out that HaddadPajouh\
    \ et al. [71] used a recurrent neural network\nfor detecting and hunting malware\
    \ in IoT. Diro and Chilamkurti [7] used the DL method\nfor cybersecurity to enable\
    \ the detection of attacks in the social IoT based on a distributed\napproach,\
    \ and Meidan et al. [76] used deep autoencoders to propose a novel network-based\n\
    anomaly detection method for detecting unusual network traffic from exploited\
    \ IoT devices.\nOther studies combine various AI methods for cybersecurity in\
    \ IoT, which serve as hybrid\nmethods. Additionally, Smys et al. [75] used a hybrid\
    \ IDS for IoT, wherein the proposed IDS\ndetected different types of attacks based\
    \ on a hybrid convolutional neural network model.\nHowever, with the rapid development\
    \ of ML and DL such as LSTM, XGBoost,\nCNN, NN, TCN, models provide efﬁcient classiﬁcation\
    \ with high accuracy. We found\nthat [72,74,77,79,83] used LSTM techniques with\
    \ potential of RNN to hunt IoT malware and\nOpCodes sequence. The LSTM model is\
    \ capable of learning on dependencies with input\ndatasets. In addition, the advancements\
    \ models techniques classiﬁcation, prediction time\nseries data to detect cybersecurity\
    \ attacks within IoT environment. The LSTM structure\nhas memory that stores previous\
    \ time step information similar to blockchain technology.\nXGBoost techniques\
    \ signiﬁcantly improved based on boosting algorithms in cybersecurity\nsuch as\
    \ to detect power grid cyber-attacks [62]. However, most studies from literature\n\
    used single model technique with evaluating the model using NSL-KDD, KDD99 datasets.\n\
    While at the current stage those datasets are outdated, we suggest using updated\
    \ detests\nfrom real-world, real-time IoT systems. Multiple models can be combined\
    \ to archive better\nresults, performance and high detection techniques.\n5.3.\
    \ RQ3: What Are the Available Practices to Reduce Cybersecurity Attacks for IoT\
    \ Using\nAI Approaches?\nWe found that many AI approaches have been proposed by\
    \ researchers to tackle,\nreduce cybersecurity attacks in IoT systems. The available\
    \ methods include smart intrusion\ndetection systems, anomaly detection techniques,\
    \ and intelligent architectural frameworks.\nAn efﬁcient DL based classiﬁcation\
    \ and technique has been used to detect cyber-attacks in\nIoT networks communications\
    \ through the development of new autonomous DL classiﬁ-\ncation systems using\
    \ CNN [10]. AI-based data encryption enhances intermediates nodes\nof IoT systems\
    \ [12]. In addition, AI approaches explore IoT data features extraction and\n\
    provide intrusion detection systems with feature extractions for smart cities\
    \ based on deep\nmigration learning model [74]. However, the current AI techniques\
    \ have limitations such\nas long training time due to large input datasets and\
    \ high computational complexity. In\naddition, we suggest improving efﬁciency\
    \ of AI models with a combination of models for\nbetter performance and high detection\
    \ techniques.\n6. Artiﬁcial Intelligence Roadmap\nIn this section, we provide\
    \ an AI roadmap with brief overview of its development in\ndetecting cybersecurity\
    \ attacks within IoT systems. The methods have been categorized\nbased on the\
    \ cybersecurity threats they identify such as Probe, U2R, R2L and DoS as shown\n\
    in Figure 8.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n18 of 27\nFigure 8. Illustration of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence methods based on attacks categories.\n6.1. AI for Detecting Probe\
    \ Attack\nProbe attacks aim to obtain data based on target external network sources\
    \ such as\nportsweep and IPsweep. The effects of probe attacks make data vulnerable\
    \ within peer\nnetworks which gives an attacker the ability to spy, access, or\
    \ gather information. This\nattack can be detected using AI-based techniques.\
    \ For example, Zhang et al. [86] proposed\nan IDS model based on genetic algorithm\
    \ (GA) and deep belief network (DBN) to achieve\na high detection rate in IoT\
    \ systems. In addition, a fast intrusion detection system was\nproposed using\
    \ hybrid AI techniques such as RF, Naïve Bayes, C4.5, REPTree algorithm to\ndetect\
    \ attacks [87].\n6.2. AI for Detecting U2R Attack\nUser to root (U2R) attack aims\
    \ to have access into systems as normal account such\nattacks include perl and\
    \ xterm. The effects of U2R attacks include manipulating, spying\nor interrupting\
    \ normal system behavior. In Bagaa et al. [88], a novel SVM model was\nproposed\
    \ based on a security framework to enable mitigating different threats such as\
    \ U2R\nin IoT systems. In addition, a GA has been proposed for generating rules\
    \ to detect U2R\nthreats [89].\n6.3. AI for Detecting R2L Attack\nRemote to user\
    \ (R2L) attacks occur when a user sends packets to system which do\nnot have legal\
    \ access such as xclock and guest password. The effects of R2L attacks\nexploit\
    \ system privileges. AI methods for detecting R2L attacks include Chatterjee and\n\
    Hanawal [90]. In the paper, a federated learning IDS was proposed based on a probabilistic\n\
    hybrid ensemble classiﬁer (PHEC) using KNN and RF to centralize IoT security.\
    \ Moreover,\na GA was proposed for generating rules to detect R2L attacks [89].\n\
    6.4. AI for Detecting DoS Attack\nDenial of services (DoS) attack is among the\
    \ most common, due to its easy execution.\nIt can be performed by disturbing the\
    \ network trafﬁc such as DDoS and UDP storm. The\neffects of DoS attacks make\
    \ system resources very busy to serve networking genuine\nrequests. An AI detection\
    \ model has been proposed using various ML/DL techniques\nwhich include CNN, RNN\
    \ and SVM to detect DoS attacks in IoT Botnets datasets [88,91].\n7. Discussion\n\
    In this section, we discuss our study ﬁndings in terms of the research questions\n\
    presented in Section 1. We summarize the major ﬁndings and explain the limitations\
    \ of\nour systematic literature review (SLR). Finally, recommendations for future\
    \ investigations\nare presented. Our analysis and evaluation from empirical studies\
    \ revealed that several\nvulnerabilities and threats that can lead to attacks\
    \ exist in the IoT environment. Moreover,\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n19 of 27\n\
    these attacks compromise the integrity of the IoT, which behaves abnormally during\
    \ event\nprocessing owing to malicious activities. With the rapid increase in\
    \ the number of IoT\ndevices resulting from the emergence of Industry 4.0, security\
    \ aspects must be prioritized.\nAI methods are the most promising approach for\
    \ overcoming these security issues through\nthe detection and identiﬁcation of\
    \ threats and attacks using smart IDSs and intelligent\narchitectural frameworks.\
    \ Moreover, the AI methods vary for different types of ML/DL in\nterms of event\
    \ processing performance in an IoT environment.\nAs shown in Table 9, we indicate\
    \ some selected AI models currently trending. The\nOIE contribute towards model\
    \ extracting information from unstructured data for valuable\ncyber threat information\
    \ when analyzing cybersecurity report [92]. In natural language\nprocessing, transformer-based\
    \ models are most effective towards detecting misinformation,\nmachine translation,\
    \ text summarization on large scale with less human effort to generate\nfake cyber\
    \ threats intelligence text description with transformed based-model [93]. XGBoost\n\
    model based on gradient boosting library also among high efﬁcient models towards\n\
    decision making, XGBoost have used for security modelling to detect cyber security\
    \ based\non abnormalities and multi-attacks [94]. The LSTM models play a vital\
    \ role among AI\nmodels for classiﬁcation, prediction on time series data based\
    \ on a recurrent neural network,\nLSTM technique have been used to introduce a\
    \ deep frequency decomposition model to\nachieve stock prediction [95]. EBM model\
    \ provides generative model from statistical\nphysics used self-supervised learning\
    \ based on EBM for equilibrium thermodynamics\ndue to its softmax layer and mapping\
    \ energies to probabilities [96]. In prediction research\nespecially during the\
    \ coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As it is been spreading within\ncountries\
    \ such as used ISI model for proposing COVID-19 prediction to estimate the\ninfection\
    \ variety for analyzing transmission laws with development trends [97]. However,\n\
    the AI model has been providing a classiﬁcation of misconceptions, myths and desired\n\
    where the authors elaborate more on the most popular AI models with statistical\
    \ methods\nrepresenting characteristics models which include NN, ES, HMM, AB,\
    \ and GLM [98].\nLastly, all AI models presented are effective, efﬁcient in performance\
    \ towards various\napplications for decisions, classiﬁcation, and statistics with\
    \ many more.\nTable 9. List of some selected trends for artiﬁcial intelligence\

    \ summarizes the empirical studies using only 80 research\narticles based on a\
    \ search strategy by examining several databases, including SCOPUS,\nScience Direct,\
    \ IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI. Consequently, certain related\n\
    studies may not be included as the search was performed considering journal papers\n\
    published over ﬁve years (2016–2021). Moreover, non-English studies were excluded.\
    \ In\naddition, some database searches are excluded such as Springer.\nAfter a\
    \ critical analysis, we determined that several proposed frameworks are weak\n\
    in terms of methodology and data analysis, which leads to an outcome with low\
    \ accuracy.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 198\n22 of 27\nAdditionally, each proposed\
    \ system has certain problems that have not yet been solved.\nAlthough the results\
    \ of certain studies are in different metric performances, we focused\nmore on\
    \ results in terms of accuracy (%) when analyzing IoT security using AI methods.\
    \ In\naddition, it is worth mentioning that several studies did not report the\
    \ predictive features\nof their datasets. Finally, our paper has some potential\
    \ extensions and further applications\nbut we are unable to investigate several\
    \ threats which include fault injection, jamming in\nthe IoT environment.\n9.\
    \ Recommendations for Future Investigations\nOwing to the rapid development and\
    \ increase in the use of IoT devices in various\nsectors, which include IIoT,\
    \ medical IoT, energy IoT, and CPS, we recommend further\ninvestigation of the\
    \ existing AI algorithms by introducing next-generation approaches\nin IoT security\
    \ and privacy. Additionally, search databases other than SCOPUS, Science\nDirect,\
    \ IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI should be analyzed.\nOur results\
    \ reveal that different AI approaches have been proposed and implemented by\n\
    researchers based on ML/DL algorithms, including hybrid methods that combine different\n\
    algorithms. This implies that improving the existing intelligent architectural\
    \ frameworks can\naid in introducing different AI methods of ML/DL with better\
    \ performance.\nOur results also, verify the existence of different types of cybersecurity\
    \ attacks, such\nas DDoS, sinkhole, wormhole, and ramping attacks, in the IoT\
    \ environment. Although\nthese attacks are categorized as DoS, probe, R2L, and\
    \ U2R attacks, researchers can explore\nvulnerabilities beyond these categories.\
    \ Moreover, the most vulnerable layer in IoT needs\nto be identiﬁed.\nFurther\
    \ work also needs to be performed in improving the detection accuracy as\nwell\
    \ as concentrating on the availability of recent real-world datasets in order\
    \ to detect\nnew types of IoT threats. Finally, we anticipate our SLR results\
    \ will encourage further\ninspiration in developing new IDS/AI models to secure\
    \ the IoT environment against\ncybersecurity threats and attacks.\n10. Conclusions\n\
    In this paper, we present a systematic review of cybersecurity detection attacks\
    \ in\nthe IoT using AI methods. Due to their rapid development in the various\
    \ domains, large\namounts of data are constantly being generated, which requires\
    \ an increased focus on\nprivacy and security. Attacks in IoT can be categorized\
    \ into Probe, R2L, U2R, and DoS. If\nthese attacks succeed, IoT performance can\
    \ be compromised in many ways such as giving\nfalse information. While in the\
    \ past, traditional methods have been used for improving IoT\nsecurity, due to\
    \ the rapid evolution of cyber threats. As a result of industrial 4.0, the AI\n\
    approach can be considered one of the most promising methods.\nWe summarized,\
    \ categorized, and mapped the existing literature on AI methods for the\ndetection\
    \ of cybersecurity attacks in IoT environments using formulated research questions.\n\
    The survey was conducted using the PRISMA method, wherein eighty studies from\
    \ 2016 to\n2021 were carefully selected and evaluated. However, the SLR validates\
    \ that AI approaches\nare a promising method for providing security and privacy\
    \ in IoT environments.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.A. and Y.B.;\

  analysis: The work uses a survey-based approach to systematically collect and analyze
    solutions that address distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on the infrastructure
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) by employing software-defined networks (SDNs).
    A total of 25 related papers from reputable academic sources like IEEE, ACM, and
    Springer were reviewed and thoroughly analyzed. According to the analysis, researchers
    have been actively working on developing mitigation techniques against different
    classes of DDoS attacks and investigating several technologies that can enhance
    the performance of existing methods. We found that most of the proposed solutions
    mainly focus on mitigating specific types of DDoS attacks, such as volumetric
    or application-layer attacks, and do not provide a comprehensive approach to address
    the entire spectrum of DDoS threats. Furthermore, the majority of the solutions
    are centralized, which limits their scalability and resilience in large-scale
    IoT networks. Hybrid approaches that combine multiple mitigation techniques and
    leverage emerging technologies, such as fog and cloud computing, show promise
    in addressing the limitations of existing solutions. However, there is a need
    for further research to develop more sophisticated and efficient mitigation mechanisms
    that can effectively handle the evolving nature of DDoS attacks in the context
    of IoT-SDN networks. Exploring the potential of recent advancements in artificial
    intelligence and machine learning for DDoS attack mitigation is also a promising
    direction for future research.

    \ Things (IoT) has attracted much attention from the Information and\nCommunication\
    \ Technology (ICT) community in recent years. One of the main reasons for this\n\
    is the availability of techniques provided by this paradigm, such as environmental\
    \ monitoring\nemploying user data and everyday objects. The facilities provided\
    \ by the IoT infrastructure allow\nthe development of a wide range of new business\
    \ models and applications (e.g., smart homes,\nsmart cities, or e-health). However,\
    \ there are still concerns over the security measures which need\nto be addressed\
    \ to ensure a suitable deployment. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks\
    \ are\namong the most severe virtual threats at present and occur prominently\
    \ in this scenario, which can be\nmainly owed to their ease of execution. In light\
    \ of this, several research studies have been conducted\nto ﬁnd new strategies\
    \ as well as improve existing techniques and solutions. The use of emerging\n\
    technologies such as those based on the Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN) paradigm\
    \ has proved\nto be a promising alternative as a means of mitigating DDoS attacks.\
    \ However, the high granularity\nthat characterizes the IoT scenarios and the\
    \ wide range of techniques explored during the DDoS\nattacks make the task of\
    \ ﬁnding and implementing new solutions quite challenging. This problem\nis exacerbated\
    \ by the lack of benchmarks that can assist developers when designing new solutions\n\
    for mitigating DDoS attacks for increasingly complex IoT scenarios. To ﬁll this\
    \ knowledge gap,\nin this study we carry out an in-depth investigation of the\
    \ state-of-the-art and create a taxonomy that\ndescribes and characterizes existing\
    \ solutions and highlights their main limitations. Our taxonomy\nprovides a comprehensive\
    \ view of the reasons for the deployment of the solutions, and the scenario\n\
    in which they operate. The results of this study demonstrate the main beneﬁts\
    \ and drawbacks of each\nsolution set when applied to speciﬁc scenarios by examining\
    \ current trends and future perspectives,\nfor example, the adoption of emerging\
    \ technologies based on Cloud and Edge (or Fog) Computing.\nKeywords: Distributed\
    \ Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS); Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN);\nInternet\

    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [1] is expected to cause more changes in the way technology\n\
    permeates society and the economy. IoT allows everyday objects to be connected\
    \ to devices that\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078; doi:10.3390/s20113078\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n2 of 28\ncommunicate with each other or with other systems\
    \ via a network. By doing so, IoT enables\nhyper-connected environments, e.g.,\
    \ in homes, factories, and hospitals, to be leveraged to provide new\ntypes of\
    \ services [2]. However, to ensure the maximum beneﬁts can be derived from this\
    \ technology,\nmany challenges have to be addressed, particularly in terms of\
    \ security and privacy [3].\nIn a typical IoT scenario, there are several smart\
    \ devices (e.g., sensors, household items,\nand personal items) that interact\
    \ with remote applications by collecting and sending data from\nthe environment\
    \ (e.g., weather information, vital patient data, and trafﬁc information) [4].\n\
    Hence, these applications may be vulnerable to the actions of malicious agents\
    \ that aim to make\nthem unavailable, or even use the IoT devices themselves as\
    \ a launching pad for attacks on different\ndomains [5].\nOne of the aggravating\
    \ factors in this scenario is the lack of embedded security\nmechanisms, which\
    \ is often due to the limited processing capacity of the IoT devices [6].\nIn\
    \ addition, the large-scale dissemination of new smart devices connected to the\
    \ Internet is\nleading to the emergence of increasingly complex IoT infrastructures\
    \ with heterogeneous features and\nrequirements [7,8]. It is estimated that around\
    \ 29 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by\nthe year 2022 [9].\
    \ These factors make the process of detecting and mitigating virtual threats much\n\
    more complex and require new defense mechanisms to maintain specialized skills\
    \ in order to provide\nan appropriate level of protection.\nOne of the leading\
    \ virtual threats today that poses risks to the operation of IoT applications\
    \ is the\nDistributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) [10]. This type of attack\
    \ often occurs on the Internet due to\nits ease of execution (some companies offer\
    \ DDoS attacks as a service) [11]. In addition, DDoS attacks\ncan threat the availability\
    \ of a target in seconds. Reports from specialized security companies have\nrevealed\
    \ a gradual expansion in the scope of DDoS attacks carried out in recent years.\
    \ The severity of\nthis growth has caused substantial ﬁnancial losses to corporations\
    \ and can further affect millions of\nusers worldwide [12]. The most signiﬁcant\
    \ DDoS attack ever recorded was directed at the servers of\nGithub in 2018. The\
    \ attack exploited an area of vulnerability in an application layer protocol that\
    \ was\ndesigned to deliver 129 million requests per second and reach a total volume\
    \ of trafﬁc of 1.35 Tbps [13],\nfollowing in the footsteps of the most signiﬁcant\
    \ attack recorded in 2016 that involved 1.2 Tbps [14].\n1.1. Problem Statement\n\
    In light of this, there is a need for new technologies that are capable of providing\
    \ more efﬁcient\nways of protecting the network against DDoS attacks. These attacks\
    \ are usually carried out on a large\nscale from botnets formed by IoT devices\
    \ and are mainly aimed at devices that can be exploited [15].\nOne of the main\
    \ examples in this regard is the Mirai botnet [16], which in 2016 halted a signiﬁcant\n\
    subset of the Internet, impacting several countries. Mirai used an enormous number\
    \ of geo-distributed\nIoT devices to orchestrate the attacks. This technique signiﬁcantly\
    \ increased the effectiveness of the\nattack, as it made it difﬁcult to locate\
    \ the attacker. A recent report [17] shows that in the third quarter of\n2019,\
    \ the United States and the Netherlands had the highest rate of devices owned\
    \ by botnets that were\nused for launching DDoS attacks. This problematic situation\
    \ has required a great effort on the part of\nthe scientiﬁc community to investigate\
    \ new strategies for improving security for IoT infrastructures,\nintending to\
    \ mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks.\nIn this scenario, the advent of new network\
    \ technologies, such as those brought about by the\nSoftware-Deﬁned Networking\
    \ (SDN) paradigm [18], can be viewed as one of the main advances\nfor reducing\
    \ the complexity of managing traditional networks [19]. This is made possible\
    \ through\nthe opportunities provided by the SDN paradigm to design a ﬂexible\
    \ infrastructure assisted by the\ncapabilities of a programmable control plane.\
    \ This means that the (network and security) functions\nthat were previously operated\
    \ individually on each of the network switch can now be carried out and\nmanaged\
    \ in a uniﬁed manner through the resources provided by the control plane. Communication\n\
    between the controller and other network elements is usually carried out through\
    \ an API that enable\nthe reconﬁguration of the system at runtime. Thanks to its\
    \ (logically) centralized approach, the SDN\ncontroller can monitor and manage\
    \ the entire underlying network infrastructure, and thus provide\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3078\n3 of 28\na holistic view of the network. Concerning security, the\
    \ devices provided by the SDN architecture\ncan maximize the detection and capacity\
    \ to contain virtual threats, and thus devise more efﬁcient and\nprogrammable\
    \ mechanisms [20].\nRecently, several studies have adopted SDN in the design of\
    \ techniques for providing security\nin several sectors, such as access control\
    \ [21], reliable data communication [22], and malware\ndetection [23,24], among\
    \ others. Regarding DDoS attacks in particular [25], the solutions that made use\n\
    of the resources provided by the SDN architecture, proved to be effective in detecting\
    \ and mitigating\nattacks, owing to the beneﬁts of programmability introduced\
    \ through softwarization techniques [26].\nThese techniques lead to the development\
    \ of more efﬁcient models that are capable of supporting the\nconstantly evolving\
    \ DDoS attacks [27].\nThus, there have been several research endeavors aimed at\
    \ ﬁnding new solutions for mitigating\nDDoS attacks on IoT infrastructures [28].\
    \ However, these solutions are tailored on speciﬁc situations\n(e.g., small network\
    \ infrastructures composed by domestic IoT devices) which prevents these\nmechanisms\
    \ from being widely adopted in heterogeneous environments where the requirements\n\
    are constantly changing. For this reason, it is important to have a holistic understanding\
    \ of the\ncurrent DDoS mitigation solutions in the literature. Studies of this\
    \ nature give insights to both\nnetwork operators seeking an appropriate mitigation\
    \ system for their infrastructure and to developers\nconcerned with implementing\
    \ new mitigation mechanisms. Recent surveys fail to focus on the ﬁeld of\nmitigating\
    \ DDoS attacks harnessing SDN. This knowledge gap hinders our ability to research\
    \ novel\nand effective solutions driven by SDN features. Aside from that, the\
    \ knowledge gap also limits the\nunderstanding about the effects of defense mechanisms\
    \ in the face of certain threat situations resulting\nfrom the wide diversity\
    \ of IoT environments.\nThe herein above-elicited issues motivate our investigations\
    \ on chasing to close such a knowledge\ngap. Hence, the main goal of this paper\
    \ is to enable security-enhanced IoT environments so that\nmitigating DDoS attacks\
    \ through the assistance of SDN features. In light of this main goal, it is\n\
    imperative to follow several key objectives: (i) in-depth investigation proposing\
    \ a taxonomy that\ncovers several dimensions related to defense strategies in\
    \ network infrastructures; (ii) extensive\nanalysis covering the most common application\
    \ scenarios and include a comparative and qualitative\ndiscussion; (iii) correlation\
    \ of types of both mitigation approaches adopted and mitigation strategies\nthrough\
    \ the inclusion of a few comparison parameters. To accomplish the objectives mentioned\
    \ above,\nwe have employed a methodology to support the entire research process,\
    \ which ranges from the\nreview method to the establishment of the taxonomy. The\
    \ following sections provide a full description\nof each of the methodological\
    \ procedures. It is worth mentioning that practical analysis regarding\nimplementation\
    \ and simulation of attacks is out of the scope of the present paper, but is a\
    \ key task in\nour future research directions.\n1.2. Contributions\nThe main research\

    \ Organization\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in Section\
    \ 2 we introduce some concepts of\nrelated technologies. In Section 3 we examine\
    \ key research studies that are related to this paper and\ndraws attention to\
    \ what is contributed to by our research. In Section 4 we deﬁne methodologies\
    \ and\nresearch techniques employed in the review, followed by Section 5, where\
    \ we carry out an in-depth\ninvestigation of the state-of-the-art. In Section\
    \ 6 we propose our taxonomy on DDoS attack mitigation\nstrategies employing SDN\
    \ techniques in IoT environments. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude our report\n\
    with some ﬁnal considerations and give some suggestions for future work in this\
    \ area.\n2. Theoretical Background\nWe begin this section by providing key deﬁnitions\
    \ concerning security issues in the Internet of\nThings. We then give an overview\
    \ of Distributed Denial of Service attacks and conclude the section by\nexplaining\
    \ how Software-Deﬁned Networking can be employed for mitigating DDoS attacks.\n\
    2.1. IoT Security\nDespite existing prospects for revolutionizing the current\
    \ computing paradigm, there are still\nseveral IoT security issues that require\
    \ investigation. One of these is the lack of security mechanisms\nin the devices\
    \ embedded in the IoT ecosystem. In particular, their restrictions in terms of\
    \ static\nconﬁgurations and computational resources. These limitations make these\
    \ devices easy targets for\nvarious threats that can be found on the Internet\
    \ [29]. Currently, the most severe security threat in\nthe IoT is that from DDoS\
    \ attacks [30], which remains a signiﬁcant challenge in terms of detection\nand\
    \ mitigation.\nThe wide range of IoT application scenarios has led to several\
    \ different security requirements, and\nit is a difﬁcult task to meet all of them.\
    \ Bawany and Shamsi [31] suggests that the security requirements\nfor IoT applications\
    \ should be assessed in terms of the impact of the DDoS attacks. Table 1 describes\n\
    the effects of DDoS attacks on particular types of IoT applications and summarizes\
    \ the security\nrequirements for each application context [31].\nTable 1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Internet of Things (IoT) applications based on your security requirements\
    \ [31].\nIoT Applications\nImpact of DDoS Attacks\nSecurity Requirements\nTrafﬁc\

    \ are the most appropriate.\nThe allowable interval between detection and the\

    \ categories.\nLow rates of false-positives.\nWater supply\nWeather monitoring\n\

    \ verticals\n(e.g., transportation, healthcare, energy, and others) dependable\
    \ by nature since failure is not an\noption. Aside from that, mitigation mechanisms\
    \ should be proactive and highly effective in chasing the\nprevention of any type\
    \ of service disruption events. Although they have signiﬁcant social implications,\n\
    applications such as location systems, agricultural automation, and industrial\
    \ systems have a higher\nfault tolerance than essential services (e.g., smart\
    \ grids and healthcare). Furthermore, applications for\nhome automation, water\
    \ supply, and parking control do not need such strict security standards as the\n\
    previous two (2) categories [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n5 of 28\n2.2. Distributed\
    \ Denial of Service Attacks\nThe primary purpose of a Distributed Denial of Service\
    \ Attack is to deplete the network resources\nor hardware of a victim (usually\
    \ an Internet service) and thus make it impossible for legitimate users\nto access\
    \ it. In this way, DDoS attacks entail seizing control of various devices and\
    \ making use of them,\nto send numerous requests to the victim or to exploit known\
    \ vulnerabilities [28]. DDoS attacks can\nbe divided into three (3) types: (i)\
    \ application-layer attacks; (ii) resource exhaustion attacks; and (iii)\nvolumetric\
    \ attacks [32].\n2.2.1. Application Layer Attacks\nAttacks on the application\
    \ layer attempt to take advantage of vulnerabilities that are present in an\n\
    application or service and can cause instability, thus making it unfeasible for\
    \ legitimate users to gain\naccess. These attacks are often mistaken for implementation\
    \ errors, as low rates of malicious trafﬁc are\nneeded to reproduce the behavior\
    \ of legitimate customers. Thus, these attacks go unnoticed by most\nof the conventional\
    \ detection mechanisms [26].\nA typical attack on the application layer is the\
    \ Slowloris [33]. In this situation, incomplete requests\nare sent to a web server\
    \ at predeﬁned intervals, to keep several connections open for the longest\npossible\
    \ time and, hence, reach the limit for connections that the server can maintain.\
    \ This means\nthat shortly after the attack begins, the server becomes unable\
    \ to receive new connections and then\nbecomes unavailable to legitimate users.\
    \ To ensure it is effective, the Slowloris attack uses the smallest\namount of\
    \ bandwidth possible, which allows it to go unnoticed by detection mechanisms\
    \ triggered by\nanomalies [34] in network trafﬁc.\n2.2.2. Resource Exhaustion\
    \ Attacks\nAttacks in this category aim to deplete hardware resources such as\
    \ memory, CPU, and storage, and\nthus make servers unavailable by exploiting vulnerabilities\
    \ in protocols that are usually implemented\nat the network layer. Therefore,\
    \ exhaustion attacks not only rely on the volume of trafﬁc used but on\nthe combination\
    \ of speciﬁc messages [32].\nThe principal resource exhaustion attacks involve\
    \ exploiting the characteristics of the TCP\ncommunication protocol. A typical\
    \ example of this attack is the TCP SYN Flood, which establishes a\nthree-way\
    \ connection of the TCP protocol to exhaust the space for managing connections\
    \ (backlog).\nTCP SYN Flood is performed by sending SYN messages to the victim,\
    \ using spoofed source\naddresses [35], and thus always making the target establish\
    \ a new connection for the malicious\ncustomer. Then, the target server waits\
    \ for conﬁrmation from the client to complete the establishment\nof the connection,\
    \ which never occurs. Finally, it causes a depletion of the backlog and, hence\
    \ makes it\nimpossible to open new connections.\n2.2.3. Volumetric Attacks\nVolumetric\
    \ attacks aim to make a system unavailable by saturating the communication links\
    \ used\nto access the victim. For this reason, volumetric attacks are much more\
    \ expressive concerning the\namount of trafﬁc generated during their execution\
    \ when compared to application layer attacks and\nresource exhaustion or protocol\
    \ exploitation [36].\nThe most common volumetric attacks exploit any excessive\
    \ increase in packet size using the\nUDP protocol. Well-known examples of volumetric\
    \ attacks are ampliﬁcation attacks [37], which send\nrequests to servers on the\
    \ Internet to alter the source address ﬁeld with the victim’s address. In essence,\n\
    this causes the responses to be ampliﬁed by the servers and thus exhaust the bandwidth\
    \ of the target.\nFor this reason, NTP and DNS servers are mainly used as enablers,\
    \ as they allow high rates of response\nampliﬁcation [38].\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3078\n6 of 28\n2.3. Mitigation Strategies for DDoS Attacks by Means of SDN\n\
    The beneﬁts introduced by the SDN paradigm, such as the programmability of the\
    \ control plane\nand the ubiquitous management of the network, is encouraging\
    \ the development of new techniques\nfor mitigating virtual threats. The following\
    \ sections describe the main strategies for mitigating DDoS\nattacks that employ\
    \ the SDN paradigm.\n2.3.1. Flow Filtering\nThe ﬂow ﬁltering strategy is implemented\
    \ natively in OpenFlow-compliant devices, which makes\nit the most straightforward\
    \ approach that can be adopted for SDN-based mitigation solutions [39].\nThis\
    \ strategy takes into account the ﬁelds present in the headers of packages that\
    \ arrive at OpenFlow\ndevices to block ﬂows classiﬁed as malicious. Among the\
    \ main parameters that can be used during the\nﬁltering process are: (i) the source\
    \ address; (ii) destination address; (iii) port of origin; (iv) destination\n\
    port; and (v) network layer protocol [40]. Although it is one of the most practical\
    \ alternatives to\nimplement, it still depends on the gathering of statistics\
    \ by the controller as well as on the inspection of\npackets. This approach can\
    \ result in a considerable increase in delay while detecting the DDoS attack,\n\
    which could create a bottleneck in the controller communication interface [41].\n\
    2.3.2. Honeypots\nThis strategy involves using systems in isolated and monitored\
    \ environments that simulate\nthe characteristics of a legitimate target so that\
    \ information can be collected to update the current\ndetection and mitigation\
    \ policies. A honeypot is made available on the Internet, which can be hacked\n\
    by malicious agents who think they are attacking a real target. Although this\
    \ is a traditional attack\nmitigation technique, it can be used in combination\
    \ with SDN, to assist the controller in gathering\ninformation about malicious\
    \ trafﬁc [42].\n2.3.3. Rate Limiting\nA network may become unavailable as a result\
    \ of overload in its communication links, which is\nusually caused by injecting\
    \ a large amount of malicious trafﬁc, as in the case of volumetric attacks.\n\
    In this scenario, the SDN controller can deﬁne a maximum limit for the volume\
    \ of trafﬁc that can\nbe processed by the network without the network becoming\
    \ overloaded. If it reaches the threshold,\nthe network rejects all subsequent\
    \ packages. Furthermore, security applications usually adopt this\nstrategy in\
    \ conjunction with Deep Package Inspection procedures [25].\n2.3.4. Moving Target\
    \ Defense\nThe Moving Target Defense approach entails using techniques to dynamically\
    \ and continuously\nreconﬁgure/update the characteristics of a network or system\
    \ based on a set of random values\nto attempt to prevent attackers from making\
    \ the target system unavailable [43]. One of the main\ntechniques used is the\
    \ randomization of IP and MAC addresses, which makes it difﬁcult to discover\n\
    information about hosts and services on the network during the process and prevent\
    \ possible DDoS\nattacks. Although the use of MTD techniques has been broadly\
    \ adopted to mitigate DDoS attacks [43],\nsome gaps related to these mechanisms\
    \ are considered critical [44], such as the impact in terms of\nperformance and\
    \ cost caused by the deployment of MTD mechanisms on large-scale networks.\n2.3.5.\
    \ Traceback\nTraceback uses the information in packet headers to deﬁne an attacker’s\
    \ real origin. In traditional\nnetworks, the process is complicated because the\
    \ network switches are unable to identify the origin\nof the packets because the\
    \ source address ﬁeld has been falsiﬁed. However, the beneﬁts provided by\nthe\
    \ holistic view of the SDN control plane show the value of ﬁnding mitigation solutions\
    \ based on\ntraceback [45].\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n7 of 28\n2.3.6. Request Prioritization\n\
    In this strategy, a priority value is deﬁned for processing the ﬂows that reach\
    \ the network.\nThe priority works by assigning a default reliability value to\
    \ the source hosts for each new packet-in\nthat arrives at the SDN controller.\
    \ The reliability value is based on the trafﬁc history of each host.\nThis value\
    \ may vary over time as a result of suspicious activity (e.g., when a large number\
    \ of ﬂows\nis generated in short time intervals), and this results in a reduced\
    \ reliability value. In addition,\nif the source has a low conﬁdentiality value\
    \ (which is deﬁned by the system administrator), its ﬂows\nare rejected.\n3. Related\
    \ Work\nThe literature reveals that many studies have been carried out in recent\
    \ years to foster discussion\non general and speciﬁc security issues in IoT networks.\
    \ In the following, we encourage discussion on a\nset of recent studies in this\
    \ regard and raise our ﬁndings on the analysis.\nKouicem et al. [46] conducted\
    \ a study on general aspects of IoT security, i.e., conﬁdentiality,\nprivacy,\
    \ availability, and mitigation of DDoS attacks. In this study, the authors highlighted\
    \ speciﬁc\napplications in e-health scenarios, smart grids, and smart cities.\n\
    As a result of their analyses,\nthe solutions reviewed were classiﬁed, and took\
    \ into account factors based on the adoption of emerging\ntechnologies such as\
    \ blockchain and SDN.\nIn Cherian and Chatterjee [29], the authors reviewed several\
    \ mechanisms designed to solve\nproblems related to general aspects of information\
    \ security, and also examined emerging technologies\nsuch as SDN, blockchain,\
    \ and Machine Learning [47].\nFarris et al. [48] analyzed several attacks that\
    \ can compromise the security of IoT devices, such as\nthe spreading of malicious\
    \ code, DDoS attacks, and attacks on routing devices. In addition, there is a\n\
    comprehensive discussion of the beneﬁts provided by the Network Function Virtualization\
    \ (NFV) and\nSDN technologies for ﬁnding solutions for the mitigation of the investigated\
    \ threats.\nThe reviews carried out in Kalkan and Zeadally [49] and Kanagavelu\
    \ and Aung [27] provide\nan overview of solutions that use SDN to protect IoT\
    \ infrastructures. The authors held discussions\nabout the analyzed studies and\
    \ examined the question from the perspective of making a comparison\nbetween their\
    \ advantages and disadvantages.\nLohachab and Karambir [28], Vishwakarma and Jain\
    \ [26], and Salim et al. [50] created taxonomies\nthat examine existing DDoS attacks,\
    \ and assessed their impact in different layers of the IoT\ninfrastructure. In\
    \ addition, the studies reviewed several mechanisms for detecting and mitigating\n\
    DDoS attacks with a focus on schemes that address technologies such as machine\
    \ learning, blockchain,\nand SDN.\nThe analysis of the related literature reveals\
    \ that several previous studies have dealt with\nthe question of how to mitigate\
    \ DDoS attacks in IoT scenarios by employing SDN technologies.\nHowever, the authors\
    \ decided to conduct their studies in a more all-inclusive context and ignored\n\
    speciﬁc features of the scenario under investigation. Table 2 summarizes the contributions\
    \ made by\nprevious studies and compares them with the proposal outlined here.\
    \ The comparison is made based\non four (4) parameters that are deﬁned in line\
    \ with the related studies to ensure a fair comparison.\nThe comparative items\
    \ are described below:\n1.\nNumber of solutions reviewed: the higher the number\
    \ of mitigation solutions included in a study,\nthe more the sample can form the\
    \ basis of information necessary to assist in understanding the\npattern of current\
    \ mitigation solutions;\n2.\nClassiﬁcation of mitigation solutions: the classiﬁcation\
    \ of solutions provides a means of\nmaking it easier to understand how each solution\
    \ implements its mitigation process and, hence,\ncan characterize the current\
    \ mitigation of DDoS attacks in IoT scenarios;\n3.\nComparison of mitigation solutions:\
    \ a comparison of mitigation solutions is essential for selecting\nthe mechanisms\
    \ that can be best adapted to the needs of heterogeneous scenarios;\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 3078\n8 of 28\n4.\nIdentiﬁcation of future trends: the identiﬁcation of\
    \ promising strategies for the development of\nfuture mitigation mechanisms helps\
    \ researchers who are concerned with ﬁnding new mitigation\nsolutions to select\
    \ the techniques that best suit their speciﬁc needs.\nTable 2. Analysis of contributions\

    \ results shown in Table 2 reveal a signiﬁcant disparity between the related works\
    \ about\nthis scheme. It is evident that the main objective of previous studies\
    \ was not to carry out a\ncomprehensive study of DDoS mitigation measures in IoT\
    \ environments that make use of SDN\ntechnologies. Furthermore, none of these\
    \ previous studies encouraged any extensive discussion of\nhow to provide a classiﬁcation\
    \ and create a taxonomy capable of describing and characterizing the\nsolutions\
    \ under investigation.\n4. Review Research Method\nThe search strategy used in\
    \ this work followed the method employed by Aleesa et al. [52],\nas outlined in\
    \ Figure 1. This includes the following four (4) stages:\n1.\nSelection of the\
    \ appropriate digital libraries to carry out the search;\n2.\nDeﬁnition of a search\
    \ term based on keywords related to the subject under study;\n3.\nSelection of\
    \ studies recovered automatically from digital libraries. The decision to include\
    \ and\nexclude each work retrieved is based on their titles and abstracts;\n4.\n\
    Selection process in which each study retrieved from the initial selection is\
    \ fully read\nand analyzed.\nOther factors that may be noted when conducting a\
    \ literature review, such as the research question,\nwere not regarded as essential\
    \ for carrying out this work and have, therefore, not been included in the\nmethodology.\
    \ The searches were conducted between February 2019 and March 2020. Figure 1 outlines\n\
    the steps taken to follow the search strategy adopted for this study. The results\
    \ are shown in Figure 1\nalso include the number of studies selected in each stage.\
    \ For a fuller understanding, in the following\nsection, we provide details about\
    \ how the research strategy was implemented.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n9 of 28\n\
    Figure 1. Flowchart for the selection of papers.\n4.1. Selecting Digital Libraries\n\
    As shown in Figure 1, the search process has been conducted in the most relevant\
    \ digital libraries\nin computer science and engineering, namely:\n1.\nACM Digital\
    \ Library (https://dl.acm.org/);\n2.\nIEEE Xplore (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/);\n\
    3.\nScience Direct (https://www.sciencedirect.com/);\n4.\nScopus (https://www.scopus.com/);\n\
    5.\nSpringer Link (https://link.springer.com/);\n6.\nWeb of Science (https://apps.webofknowledge.com/);\n\
    7.\nWiley (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/);\nIn addition to the studies from\
    \ the above mentioned digital libraries, there are other relevant\nstudies have\
    \ been identiﬁed using the following automatic search engines:\n1.\nDblp (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/);\n\
    2.\nGoogle Scholar (https://scholar.google.com);\nThe criterion for source selection\
    \ was the relevance of the open bibliographical information\nin major areas of\
    \ computer science, as well as engineering journals and conference proceedings,\n\
    where high-impact scientiﬁc production can be found [39,53].\n4.2. Search Term\
    \ Used for the Filter\nThe search term used in this work has been deﬁned on the\
    \ basis of a combination of keywords\nrelated to the subject under study. The\
    \ generic form of the search term was based on the acronyms\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3078\n10 of 28\n“IOT” AND “SDN” AND “DDOS”, used to retrieve the maximum number\
    \ of potential key studies.\nThis term was ﬁnally translated into the formats\
    \ accepted by each library.\n4.3. Filtering Based on Titles and Abstracts\nThe\
    \ titles and abstracts of all the documents from digital libraries and search\
    \ engines were\nanalyzed during the initial selection process based on a set of\
    \ study selection criteria. This set includes\nthe inclusion and exclusion criteria\
    \ described below:\n•\nInclusion criteria: (i) studies reporting IoT network security\
    \ approaches using SDN; (ii) studies\naddressing DDoS attacks on IoT-SDN networks;\n\
    •\nExclusion criteria: (i) studies that cannot be validated in full text; (ii)\
    \ previous versions of more\ncomplete studies; (iii) studies unrelated to the\
    \ subject of this research; (iv) studies published in\nany language other than\
    \ English.\nThe ﬁrst inclusion criterion is more comprehensive than the second\
    \ criterion. This ﬁrst criterion\nallows the search to cover studies that address\
    \ a broader scope of network security in IoT-SDN\nscenarios, including but not\
    \ limited to DDoS. In this case, the concluding remarks and related work\nsections\
    \ were further analyzed to determine whether a study should be included or excluded.\n\
    4.4. Selection Based on Full Reading\nThe second selection process involved reading\
    \ and analyzing each pre-selected study. During the\nreading stage, all the relevant\
    \ information was extracted from the study, including contextualization,\nproblem\
    \ deﬁnition, proposed solution, and evaluation method.\nFinally, a qualitative\
    \ analysis\nof the extracted data was carried out, and the main ﬁndings were used\
    \ as input to outline the\nproposed taxonomy.\n5. Comprehensive Review of Selected\
    \ Publications\nAn appropriate selection of the mitigation strategy to be adopted\
    \ in the design of a scheme for\nmitigating DDoS attacks is of the utmost importance\
    \ since it determines the pattern of behavior of\nthe solution. For this reason,\
    \ the following sections examine the solutions reviewed by this study,\ncategorized\
    \ according to the mitigation strategies employed, namely: (i) Cosine Similarity;\
    \ (ii) Flow\nFiltering; (iii) Rate Limiting; (iv) Moving Target Defense; (v) Traceback;\
    \ (vi) Request Prioritization;\nand (vii) Collaboration Between Multiple Mitigation\
    \ Strategies.\n5.1. Cosine Similarity\nYin et al. [54] introduce the SD-IoT framework.\
    \ SD-IoT employs an algorithm based on the cosine\nsimilarity technique to carry\
    \ out DDoS attack mitigation. The algorithm in question compares the rate\nof\
    \ packets arriving at the controller at predetermined time intervals with a pre-established\
    \ ideal limit.\nThis approach enables the classiﬁcation of devices sending several\
    \ packets that exceed the amount\nallowed by the network. This solution proved\
    \ to be effective in mitigating DDoS attacks based on high\ntrafﬁc rates.\n5.2.\
    \ Flow Filtering\nXu et al. [55] discuss the constraints imposed on the use of\
    \ a single controller to manage\nIoT infrastructures. Furthermore, the authors\
    \ argue that this centralized approach jeopardizes the\nscalability of the network.\
    \ A clear example of this is the fact that each new packet that arrives at the\n\
    switches must be sent to the controller for the conﬁguration of ﬂow rules. However,\
    \ if the number of\nrequests is high, the control link between switch and controller\
    \ can become overloaded. As a result,\nthe controller is not able to process new\
    \ ﬂow requests and, consequently, the entire network becomes\nunavailable. The\
    \ authors designed the Smart Security Mechanism (SSM) to overcome this problem.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n11 of 28\nThis mechanism collects statistics regarding\
    \ the rate of unmatched ﬂows at each switch over time.\nThe collected statistics\
    \ allow the values for the correspondence limits to be deﬁned. Switches with\n\
    values below the limit ar classiﬁed as suspect. Following this, trafﬁc from the\
    \ suspicious switches is\nsent to a security middleware that is responsible for\
    \ blocking malicious ﬂows.\nÖzçelik et al. [56] present the Edge-Centric Software-Deﬁned\
    \ IoT Defense (ECESID) architecture.\nECESID was designed to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ originating from IoT devices infected by malicious\nagents, such as the Mirai\
    \ botnet. According to the authors, the closer to the source, the lower the\n\
    cost incurred for detecting and mitigating attacks. For this reason, the architecture\
    \ is based on the\ndeployment of small infrastructures close to the protected\
    \ networks. These infrastructures can analyze\nall outgoing trafﬁc and check if\
    \ there are any infected devices. This task is carried out through the\nThreshold\
    \ Random Walk employing the Credit-Based Rate Limiting (TRW-CB) algorithm. TRW-CB\n\
    is based on the number of unsuccessful connection attempts per second. Then, trafﬁc\
    \ from infected\ndevices is completely blocked.\nSalva-Garcia et al. [40] and\
    \ Molina Zarca et al. [57] introduce a security architecture for large-scale\n\
    wireless networks based on three (3) planes: (i) Admin Plane; (ii) Security Orchestration\
    \ Plane;\nand (iii) Security Enforcement Plane. The mitigation process implements\
    \ policies deﬁned by the\nnetwork administrator through the Admin Plane. These\
    \ policies are then translated into low-level\nconﬁgurations and forwarded to\
    \ the Security Orchestration Plane. The Security Orchestration Plane is\nalso\
    \ responsible for monitoring the network, detecting attacks based on a trafﬁc\
    \ signature database,\nand selecting the appropriate security policy to mitigate\
    \ the attack. After selecting the mitigation policy,\nthe Security Enforcement\
    \ Plane installs it on the SDN switches located at the edge of the network.\n\
    Another group of studies proposes architectures with a focus on mitigating DDoS\
    \ attacks\non large-scale networks. These solutions, proposed by Yan et al. [42],\
    \ Nguyen et al. [58],\nand Rathore et al. [59], use distributed controllers to\
    \ address the centralized management limitations\nof the traditional SDN architecture.\
    \ These architectures are divided into the following:\n•\nEdge: composed of devices\
    \ responsible for ensuring access control, secure data communication,\nand the\
    \ application of security rules for managing local area networks;\n•\nFog: composed\
    \ of SDN controllers responsible for detecting threats, deﬁning the appropriate\n\
    mitigation policies, and sending them to the devices at the edge layer. In addition,\
    \ they periodically\nreport the records of events that have occurred to the cloud\
    \ layer;\n•\nCloud: contains a holistic view of all managed IoT domains and is,\
    \ therefore, able to identify\nattack patterns from different domains. In this\
    \ way, mitigation policies at the global level can\nbe established.\nYang et al.\
    \ [60] propose a distributed mitigation architecture that makes use of SDN-based\
    \ IoT\ngateways deployed at the edge of the network. The gateways are designed\
    \ with enhanced capabilities\nfor detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. SDNIGWs\
    \ are composed of three (3) modules: (i) Learning\nModule; (ii) Detection Module,\
    \ and; (iii) Flow Management Module. The Learning Module collects\nﬂow statistics\
    \ and uses them to train the machine learning-based classiﬁcation algorithm. The\
    \ Detection\nModule performs the classiﬁcation of malicious ﬂows and, if so, sends\
    \ the source addresses to be\nblocked using the ﬁlter rules deﬁned by the Flow\
    \ Management Module.\nRaﬁque et al. [61] address the problem of control-link overhead\
    \ between switches and controllers,\nas discussed in Xu et al. [55]. In this context,\
    \ the authors introduce the SDIoT-Edge Security (SIESec)\nframework. SIESec makes\
    \ use of the Edge Computing [62] paradigm to deploy cloudlets close to IoT\nnetworks.\
    \ Each cloudlet implements an instance of SIESec and carries out the detection\
    \ and mitigation\nof DDoS attacks by reducing the processing load on the IoT infrastructure.\
    \ SIESec is composed of six (6)\nmodules: (i) Collector; (ii) Packet Inspector;\
    \ (iii) Feature Extraction; (iv) Classiﬁer; (v) Status Analyzer;\nand (vi) Rule\
    \ Generator. Initially, the Collector module continuously monitors the trafﬁc\
    \ at each switch\nand sends trafﬁc statistics to the Packet Inspector and Feature\
    \ Extraction. These modules pre-process\neach ﬂow and then send samples from the\
    \ trafﬁc to the Classiﬁer, which uses the Self Organization\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 3078\n12 of 28\nMaps (SOM) algorithm to classify each ﬂow as either malicious\
    \ or benign. The Status Analyzer then\nforwards the benign ﬂows to their destination,\
    \ and the malicious ﬂows to be analyzed by the Rule\nGenerator, which is responsible\
    \ for deﬁning which appropriate ﬁltering rules should be applied.\nKrishnan et\
    \ al. [63] set out a multi-layer architecture called Advanced MultiplAne SecuRity\n\
    Framework for Software Deﬁned Networks (VARMAN), which is designed for the detection\
    \ and\nmitigation of DDoS attacks in SDN-based IoT data centers. The detection\
    \ of malicious ﬂows is aided\nby several machine-learning algorithms and takes\
    \ place during the selection and classiﬁcation stages.\nThe mitigation process\
    \ makes use of NFV features that assist in the deployment of several virtual\n\
    nodes with ﬁltering capabilities. Moreover, VARMAN architecture provides load\
    \ balancing between\nSDN controllers.\nBawany and Shamsi [31] introduce the SDN-Based\
    \ Secure and Agile Framework for Protecting\nSmart Applications (SEAL). The primary\
    \ purpose of the SEAL is to provide security for IoT application\ndata centers.\
    \ SEAL can prioritize the mitigation of DDoS attacks for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on\ntheir security requirements and their assessment of the impact that\
    \ would be caused by their failure.\nSEAL is also designed to prevent DDoS attacks\
    \ on the SDN architecture itself. The framework consists\nof three (3) key modules:\
    \ (i) A-Defense; (ii) C-Defense; and (iii) D-Defense. The A-Defense module\ndetects\
    \ and mitigates DDoS attacks at the application level. It takes account of the\
    \ individual trafﬁc\ndesigned for each IoT application and prioritizes the applications\
    \ by their security requirements, which\nmight be critical, moderate, or low.\
    \ An entropy-based detection algorithm assists in the mitigation\nprocess to determine\
    \ which malicious ﬂows must be blocked. C-Defense is responsible for performing\n\
    the load balancing between controllers. Finally, D-Defense is responsible protect\
    \ the data plane and\nuses a model based on trafﬁc statistics for this task.\n\
    Ravi and Shalinie [64] employ cloud computing techniques in conjunction with SDN\
    \ to mitigate\nDDoS attacks on IoT servers. They have introduced a new mechanism\
    \ called Learning-Driven\nDetection Mitigation (LEDEM), which detects DDoS attacks\
    \ with the aid of a semi-supervised machine\nlearning algorithm. The machine learning\
    \ algorithm is responsible for identifying all the malicious\nﬂows that reach\
    \ the network and informing the controller of the addresses of the customers that\n\
    can be classiﬁed as malicious. Based on this information, the controller can deﬁne\
    \ the appropriate\nﬁltering rules.\nNair et al. [65] devise a mitigation mechanism\
    \ that draws on information about the relationship\nbetween IP and MAC addresses\
    \ to determine the occurrence of DDOS attacks in a short time.\nThe mechanism\
    \ checks whether a source MAC address is linked to more than one source IP address,\n\
    as this can indicate the existence of malicious clients with a forged IP. As well\
    \ as this, the mechanism\nuses other parameters such as packet delay time, the\
    \ number of entries in the ﬂow tables, and the\naverage time needed for the receipt\
    \ of the packets (per second) by the controller to deﬁne a threshold\nvalue that\
    \ determines the existence of a DDoS attack.\nHouda et al. [66] employ blockchain\
    \ in conjunction with SDN to design Co-IoT, a secure, low-cost,\nﬂexible, and\
    \ efﬁcient collaboration scheme against DDoS attacks in IoT environments. Co-IoT\
    \ relies on\nsmart contracts [67] as a way of sharing information about DDoS attacks\
    \ between underlying SDN\ndomains in a secure and decentralized way. Initially,\
    \ each SDN domain has to create and make use of a\ncollaboration agreement, which\
    \ is carried out through a simpliﬁed process. After this, two (2) or more\nSDN\
    \ domains establish a trust agreement and set up a network of authorized domains.\
    \ In this way,\nwhenever one of the domains is the victim of a DDoS attack, it\
    \ transfers a list of malicious addresses to\nthe domain of origin of the attacks\
    \ to block these devices.\nGaleano-Brajones et al. [68] explore the OpenState,\
    \ an extension of the Openﬂow protocol that\nprovides SDN switches with the ability\
    \ to store information about ﬂows already processed, in addition\nto storing the\
    \ rules existing in the ﬂow tables. Thus, part of the intelligence related to\
    \ containing\nDDoS attacks on IoT networks is transferred to the switches, reducing\
    \ the controller load. In addition,\nthe authors use the entropy technique to\
    \ identify malicious trafﬁc by the controller, which deﬁnes the\nappropriate ﬁltering\
    \ rules to mitigate the attack.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n13 of 28\n5.3. Rate Limiting\n\
    Sharma et al. [69] put forward the ShSec, an architecture for protecting small\
    \ IoT networks.\nThis mechanism is designed to mitigate volumetric DDoS attacks\
    \ and perform its detection process\nbased on ﬂow samples collected from the network\
    \ edge SDN switches. This strategy reduces the\namount of trafﬁc sent to the controller\
    \ and assists in preventing overloads. In addition, ShSec uses\nbuffers on each\
    \ switch as an additional strategy to mitigate the number of legitimate packets\
    \ dropped\nin the wake of a DDoS attack.\n5.4. Moving Target Defense—MTD\nKrishnan\
    \ et al. [70] introduce a distributed and hierarchical architecture for large-scale\
    \ networks,\nconsisting of four (4) layers, namely: (i) Cloud; (ii) Edge; (iii)\
    \ SDN; and (iv) IoT. High-level management\nis conducted from the cloud layer,\
    \ which deﬁnes security policies and forwards them to the edge\nlayer. In the\
    \ border layer, there are gateways with SDN support, which forward the trafﬁc\
    \ to the SDN\nlayer. In turn, the SDN layer processes trafﬁc from external domains.\
    \ The authors carried out a case\nstudy on the use of this architecture against\
    \ HTTP Flooding DDoS attacks. Mitigation takes place by\nexcluding illegitimate\
    \ connections and changing the target’s IP address. A message is sent to all the\n\
    customers with advice about the redirection, along with a CAPTCHA-like computational\
    \ challenge.\nSince malicious agents are instructed employing pre-deﬁned commands,\
    \ they are unable to decode the\ncomputational challenge and continue to attack\
    \ the old address. In this way, only legitimate customers\nremain connected.\n\
    5.5. Traceback\nChen et al. [45] provide an architecture that is capable of identifying\
    \ and mitigating DDoS\nattacks targeted smart city infrastructures as close as\
    \ possible to their source. The main purpose of\nthe scheme is to create an algorithm\
    \ that is capable of collecting ﬂow statistics from base stations\nthrough a conventional\
    \ operation. These statistics are then used to deﬁne an acceptable trafﬁc limit.\n\
    Thus, devices that may be generating trafﬁc above the threshold established for\
    \ a short period are\ntreated as suspicious and added to an anomaly tree. Then,\
    \ an additional stage of checking the anomaly\ntree is performed to determine\
    \ whether the suspect devices are malicious or not. The devices that are\nclassiﬁed\
    \ as malicious may have their trafﬁc blocked, depending on the mitigation strategy\
    \ selected by\nthe network administrator.\n5.6. Request Prioritization\nSarwar\
    \ et al. [71] present FlowJustiﬁer, a request prioritization algorithm based on\
    \ a trust return\nvalue list, which seeks to mitigate the DDoS attacks that target\
    \ the SDN-based IoT infrastructure control\nplane. The list employs conﬁdence\
    \ values to classify users according to their level of conﬁdentiality,\nwhich\
    \ is established based on the records of each user’s network activities. This\
    \ means that whenever a\nuser’s ﬂow request reaches the controller, the list of\
    \ conﬁdence values is checked to deﬁne the degree of\npriority required for processing\
    \ that user’s request. The trust list values are updated by the controller\nin\
    \ real-time whenever a new ﬂow request is processed. Thus, it is also possible\
    \ to block a sender’s\nﬂows if the sender starts sending more requests than usual.\n\
    5.7. Collaboration between Multiple Mitigation Strategies\nIn addition to the\
    \ use of specialized techniques for particular scenarios, the related literature\n\
    revealed the adoption of solutions based on collaboration between different mitigation\
    \ strategies.\nThrough this kind of integration, it is possible to offer a series\
    \ of beneﬁts, including more ﬂexible\nsolutions and the ability to mitigate a\
    \ signiﬁcantly greater number of DDoS attacks. Concerning this,\nthe main strategies\
    \ adopted are Trafﬁc ﬁltering, Machine Learning, and Trafﬁc redirection.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 3078\n14 of 28\nBull et al. [72] set out a distributed, ﬂexible, and\
    \ modular SDN architecture capable of mitigating a\nwide range of DDoS attacks\
    \ at the edge of the network. The architecture is composed of the following\n\
    layers: (i) IoT Access; (ii) Distribution Layer; and (iii) Control Layer. The\
    \ IoT Access layer consists of\nseveral IoT devices arranged in different domains.\
    \ In turn, the Distribution Layer is formed of SDN\nswitches that are responsible\
    \ for monitoring the trafﬁc coming from the devices in the IoT Access layer.\n\
    At the top of the architecture is the Control Layer, which has a pool of controllers\
    \ capable of managing\ntrafﬁc statistics from all protected IoT domains. The Control\
    \ Layer is also responsible for deﬁning\npolicies to contain malicious ﬂows, and\
    \ Rate Limiting and Flow Filtering strategies are used together\nto achieve this\
    \ goal.\nBhunia and Gurusamy [25] design the SoftThings, a distributed architecture\
    \ for mitigating a wide\nrange of DDoS attacks on small networks. The SoftThings\
    \ architecture is segmented into four (4) layers:\n(i) IoT devices; (ii) SDN switches;\
    \ (iii) SDN cluster controller; and (iii) SDN master controller. A set of\nIoT\
    \ networks represents a cluster. Each cluster is assigned an SDN cluster controller\
    \ that is responsible\nfor its management and for deﬁning local mitigation policies.\
    \ In this way, each SDN cluster controller\nmust periodically compile a report\
    \ on the trafﬁc statistics of the managed networks and send it to\nthe SDN master\
    \ controller, which is the central entity of SoftThings and has an overview of\
    \ the entire\ninfrastructure. This means it is in a position to deﬁne policies\
    \ based on Flow ﬁltering that will be\napplied globally.\nSahay et al. [73] introduce\
    \ a mechanism for protecting communication systems on ships\n(i.e., a satellite\
    \ navigation system) that is capable of detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks.\
    \ The system\nworks through a high-level language used to specify mitigation policies\
    \ that can be eventually selected\nby the network administrator and is applicable\
    \ to several types of DDoS attacks. Filtering and\nredirection of malicious trafﬁc\
    \ are available as some of the policies that can be implemented.\nRaﬁque et al.\
    \ [74] put forward CFADefense, a mechanism for mitigating Crossﬁre DDoS attacks.\n\
    The CFADefense architecture is implemented in three (3) modules: (i) Link Selection;\
    \ (ii) Attack\nDetection; and (iii) Malicious Flow Interception. In seeking to\
    \ mitigate the ﬂows from Crossﬁre\nAttack, CFADefense monitors the trafﬁc on each\
    \ link in the network and selects those with the highest\nutilization rate so\
    \ that they can be analyzed by Attack Detection. In turn, Attack Detection calculates\n\
    various statistics associated with the selected links, such as packet loss, jitter,\
    \ RTT, and throughput\nto determine the level of congestion. Once a Crossﬁre attack\
    \ has been detected, the Malicious Flow\nInterception redirects the trafﬁc on\
    \ the target link and enforces the blocking of malicious ﬂows.\nLuo et al. [75]\
    \ provide a defense method based on SDN, MTD, and honeypots that are capable\n\
    of protecting IoT environments against DDoS attacks. This method implements an\
    \ MTD strategy,\nwhich keeps changing the IP address of the devices to make it\
    \ difﬁcult for attackers to discover active\nhosts. As well as this, a second\
    \ mechanism manages several SDN-based honeypots and replicates the\nbehavior of\
    \ legitimate IoT devices to discover the activities of the attackers. By this\
    \ means, the SDN\ncontroller can use the information provided by the honeypots\
    \ to detect and block trafﬁc coming from\nattackers in real-time.\n6. Taxonomy\
    \ of DDoS Attack Migitation Approaches—Supported Featured by SDN Devices\nFacilities\
    \ to Defend IoT\nIn this section, we introduce our taxonomy intending to describe\
    \ and characterize DDoS attack\nmitigation approaches to assist the SDN defense\
    \ of IoT environments. First, there is a compiled\nclassiﬁcation that includes\
    \ the following: technology, granularity, a mitigation strategy, and IoT use\n\
    case. Each scheme is compared on an individual basis with a set of selected parameters\
    \ from the\ncurrent literature. From this point on, we outline how solutions need\
    \ to be improved and examine\nsome of the main factors that have not been addressed.\
    \ Following this, we describe the main trends in\nthe current state-of-the-art\
    \ on DDoS mitigation. Finally, we make some suggestions for future research.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n15 of 28\n6.1. Classiﬁcation of Reviewed Studies\nIn an\
    \ attempt order to compile deﬁne an appropriate classiﬁcation for the solutions\
    \ reviewed in\nthe previous section, this section establishes a taxonomy based\
    \ on how each study forms a plan for\nperforming the mitigation of a DDoS attack.\
    \ The following characteristics are taken into account:\n1.\nWhether the mitigation\
    \ strategy is implemented collaboratively by distributed network elements\nor\
    \ a single controller is responsible for the identiﬁcation, containment, and remediation\
    \ stages of\nDDoS mitigation management. The setting for distributed transactions\
    \ provides greater reliability\nas having a centralized controller is a notable\
    \ point of failure in the network and therefore a target\nfor attackers [76];\n\
    2.\nWhether other technologies, apart from SDN, have been used in the DDoS mitigation\
    \ strategy.\nFog computing, for example, has aroused considerable interest in\
    \ the network security community,\nsince it provides an opportunity to bring mitigation\
    \ resources closer to the place where the attack\nis launched;\n3.\nThe type of\
    \ mitigation strategy recommended;\n4.\nWhether the solution has been planned\
    \ for a particular IoT scenario, in works where the authors\ndo not clearly deﬁne\
    \ an IoT scenario, it can be assumed that the designed solution is intended to\n\
    be used in any IoT application scenario.\nFigure 2 outlines these characteristics\
    \ by creating a taxonomy for the classiﬁcation of DDoS\nsecurity solutions in\
    \ IoT-SDN networks. For a further understanding, the main features of this\ntaxonomy\
    \ are outlined as follows:\n•\nNon-collaborative solutions: there is no sharing\
    \ of information (e.g., trafﬁc statistics and malicious\nsource addresses) between\
    \ network elements (e.g., controllers, IoT gateways with SDN support)\nthat supply\
    \ the intelligence needed to deﬁne and enforce mitigation policies in the SDN-based\n\
    IoT network;\n–\nPure SDN: follows a “pure” (fully-centralized) SDN approach,\
    \ where a single controller is\nresponsible for responding to DDoS threats;\n\
    –\nHybrid SDN-Fog: combines centralized SDN and distributed fog computing in a\
    \ hybrid\ndesign that selects the best features of the two (2) paradigms.\n•\n\
    Collaborative Solutions: the controller must exchange information with external\
    \ systems to\nimplement a coordinated DDoS mitigation strategy.\n–\nHybrid SDN-Fog-Cloud:\n\
    establishes a multi-layer architecture that encompasses\ncloud-computing and fog-computing\
    \ layers.\nThe fog-layers provide an infrastructure\nto mitigate attacks near\
    \ the edge of the network that is being defended.\nIn addition,\nthese fog-layers\
    \ send information about security incidents and network trafﬁc to the cloud\n\
    layer. The cloud layer uses this information to deﬁne the global mitigation policies\
    \ that the\nfog-layers must implement.\n–\nHybrid SDN-Blockchain: leverages blockchain\
    \ technology to implement DDoS mitigation\nin a decentralized and reliable manner.\
    \ The smart contract mechanism ensures that there is\na secure collaboration between\
    \ the distributed SDN controllers and enables them to block\nmalicious ﬂows as\
    \ close to their source in the network as possible.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n\

    To provide an adequate comparison between the mitigation solutions reviewed in\
    \ the previous\nSection 5, we established items considered of high relevance to\

    \ of internal and external incidents: while it is essential to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ from\nexternal domains, mitigation solutions must identify compromised devices\
    \ on their network,\nespecially to prevent from malicious agents to use these\
    \ devices for performing DDoS attacks\ntargeting domains on the Internet;\n2.\n\
    Mitigation of multiple DDoS attacks types: solutions for mitigating DDoS attacks\
    \ in IoT\nenvironments must consider both conventional attacks (volumetric) as\
    \ well more sophisticated\nattacks that aim to exhaust beyond the bandwidth several\
    \ other computational resources, such as\nmemory and processing of the target\
    \ applications;\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n18 of 28\n3.\nSupporting the SDN control\
    \ plane to prevent overloads: despite providing several beneﬁts for\nmitigating\
    \ DDoS attacks in IoT environments, the SDN control plane can become the target\
    \ of\nDDoS attacks directed to exhausting its resources, such as (i) link bandwidth\
    \ between switch and\nSDN controller; and (ii) the number of rules stored in the\
    \ ﬂow tables, overloading the TCAM\nmemory of the OpenFlow switches;\n4.\nCollaborative\
    \ mitigation: performing DDoS mitigation using only a single controller can\n\
    cause issues regarding network scalability and fault tolerance.\nFor this reason,\
    \ it is of\nimmense importance to distribute the mitigation process among several\
    \ entities that can make\nmitigation collaboratively to improve performance efﬁciency\
    \ and avoid single points of failure in\nthe network.\nObserving Table 3, none\
    \ of the conducted studies are able to match all the elicited items.\nThe solutions\
    \ that employ cloud and fog computing paradigms, in conjunction with SDN, were\n\
    the that reached closest. In contrast, the solutions that perform the mitigation\
    \ only at the edge-side of\nthe network, leveraging the traditional SDN approach,\
    \ are the ones that most limited and do not meet\nthe requirements deﬁned in the\
    \ present study.\n6.3. Overview of the DDoS Attack Mitigation Scenario Harnessing\
    \ SDN in IoT Environments\nThe adoption of the SDN paradigm to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ in IoT environments is a relatively\nnew research topic. According to studies\
    \ available in the literature, researchers published the ﬁrst\nSDN-IoT mitigation\
    \ solution in 2016 [72]. Since then, the community has been developed several\n\
    mitigation mechanisms in this context. In this way, the ﬁrst solutions developed\
    \ attempted to address\nfrequent and well-explored attacks in the literature,\
    \ such as the mitigation of volumetric attacks using\nthe traditional SDN architecture.\
    \ However, since 2019 solutions have evolved substantially, and new\nmechanisms\
    \ based on the fog computing paradigm have started to be employed on the development\n\
    of distributed architectures capable of mitigating new types of DDoS attacks based\
    \ on low trafﬁc rates.\nIn light of this, Table 4 summarizes the DDoS types considered\
    \ by the analyzed solutions.\nAccording to Table 4, we note that volumetric and\
    \ exhaust attacks received much more attention\nfrom mitigation solutions when\
    \ compared to attacks on the application layer. In this regard, it is crucial\n\
    to consider that volumetric and exhaustion DDoS attacks are mainly based on directing\
    \ large amounts\nof malicious trafﬁc to the target network. This characteristic\
    \ facilitates its identiﬁcation by mechanisms\nthat use more uncomplicated mitigation\
    \ strategies, such as those that establish limits for trafﬁc arriving\non the\
    \ network (whether malicious or not). In addition, attacks aimed at the application\
    \ layer are\nbased on sending fragmented requests in different parts, such as\
    \ DDoS attacks with slow requests and\nresponses, which are easily able to disguise\
    \ themselves between legitimate trafﬁc due to the use of low\ntrafﬁc rates during\
    \ its execution. Consequently, this feature allows circumventing mechanisms based\n\
    on the identiﬁcation of anomalies in network trafﬁc, making the identiﬁcation\
    \ of this type of attack\nmore complex.\nAttacks aimed at the application layer\
    \ are undertaken by sending fragmented requests in different\nparts, such as DDoS\
    \ attacks with slow requests and responses; however, these are easily distinguished\n\
    from legitimate trafﬁc because they rely on low trafﬁc rates during their execution.\
    \ Hence, this feature\nallows circumventing mechanisms to be put into effect that\
    \ is based on their ability to detect anomalies\nin network trafﬁc, and thus make\
    \ the identiﬁcation of this type of attack more complex.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n\

    \ the analysis of network ﬂow statistics to detect anomalous actions\nare efﬁcient\
    \ in containing volumetric attacks, which are based on high trafﬁc rates [80].\
    \ Concerning\nthis, there are solutions based on the following strategies: rate\
    \ limiting, cosine similarity, traceback,\nand ﬂow prioritization, as outlined\
    \ in Table 5. However, when there is a need to mitigate DDoS attacks\nbased on\
    \ the dispatch of small trafﬁc fees to exploit particular vulnerabilities in the\
    \ services offered by\nthe IoT infrastructure, techniques based on statistical\
    \ analysis are ineffective. The main reason for this\nineffectiveness is that\
    \ they are based on anomalous behavior in the network trafﬁc and thus unable to\n\
    trigger the mitigation process. Only Krishnan et al. [63] and Raﬁque et al. [61]\
    \ were able to mitigate\nDDoS attacks with low rates through trafﬁc ﬁltering and\
    \ by adopting machine learning algorithms.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n20 of 28\n\

    Figure 3 shows the distribution of mitigation solutions for IoT scenarios. It\
    \ seems that more\nthan half of the reviewed solutions were not found for a speciﬁc\
    \ IoT scenario. For organizational\npurposes, we decided to classify mitigation\
    \ solutions as “generic” when the authors did not clearly\ndeﬁne which IoT scenario\
    \ they were applied to. It was found that mitigation solutions that focused\n\
    on the SDN control plane and smart homes represented 88% of the solutions reviewed.\
    \ On the other\nhand, some IoT scenarios, that had been less explored by the scientiﬁc\
    \ community, had only a single\nmitigation solution, namely: (i) IoT Data Centers;\
    \ (ii) Industrial IoT; and (iii) Maritime Communication\nInfrastructure. As a\
    \ result, the solutions that focused on these scenarios were grouped as “Other\n\
    scenarios”, as displayed in Table 6.\nFigure 3. Distribution of mitigation solutions\

    agents in the local network. In light of this, Özçelik et al. [56] provide an\
    \ architecture for mitigating\nDDoS at its origin by adopting fog computing approaches.\

    \ of communication between nodes through emerging\ntechnologies such as Blockchain\
    \ [59] features prominently among the other strategies in this category.\n6.3.3.\
    \ SDN Control Plane\nThe SDN control plane can itself become the target of DDoS\
    \ attacks that are aimed at exploiting\nvulnerabilities in its components and\
    \ make the underlying IoT applications unavailable. In this\nscenario, the studies\
    \ carried out in [55,61,63,71,74] put forward mechanisms that are capable of\n\
    mitigating DDoS attacks that target both the data plane and the SDN control plane.\n\
    Based on the results summarized in Tables 3 and 4, it is possible to determine\
    \ the beneﬁts offered\nby these means of providing security to the SDN control\
    \ plane that is responsible for accessing\nIoT applications. In light of this,\
    \ attention should be drawn to the fact that: (i) the solutions are\nevaluated\
    \ against DDoS attacks at low and high trafﬁc rates; and (ii) machine learning\
    \ approaches are\nmore efﬁcient in detecting malicious ﬂows than conventional\
    \ mitigation approaches that depend on\ndynamically-deﬁned trafﬁc limits. These\
    \ ﬁndings corresponded to the solutions by Krishnan et al. [63]\nand Raﬁque et\
    \ al. [61].\nIn this case, the principal drawback of these solutions that are\
    \ designed to mitigate DDoS attacks\nis their fully-centralized approach at the\
    \ edge of target networks. The main reason for this is that the\ncontroller may\
    \ become unavailable because there is a need to process a huge amount of malicious\n\
    ﬂows that exceed its computational capacity. Furthermore, solutions in this category\
    \ were validated in\nsmall-scale scenarios. These solutions were only designed\
    \ to address trafﬁc mitigation from external\nnetworks, and all processing of\
    \ requests and decision-making is centralized in the SDN controller.\n6.3.4. Smart\
    \ Homes\nIn this category, it should be noted that the main research endeavors\
    \ are to provide security for\nboth internal and external incidents on the network\
    \ by using lightweight mechanisms implemented\nwith low-cost hardware (e.g., Raspberry\
    \ Pi). Among the limitations found in the solutions applied\nin this scenario\
    \ are: (i) the mitigation process is implemented centrally at the edge of the\
    \ network\nwithout due concern for the overhead controller; and (ii) the lack\
    \ of mechanisms capable of mitigating\nDDoS attacks based on low trafﬁc rates.\
    \ The use of distributed controllers to perform the mitigation\nprocess should\
    \ be noted as a means of overcoming these limitations in a satisfactory way. In\
    \ addition,\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n22 of 28\nthe use of machine learning techniques\
    \ can be regarded as a feasible alternative, since they are useful\nin mitigating\
    \ DDoS attacks based on low trafﬁc rates [63].\n6.3.5. Other Scenarios\nThe mitigation\
    \ solutions for (i) IoT data centers, (ii) industrial IoT, and (iii) maritime\n\
    communication infrastructure, have features in common, despite being designed\
    \ for different scenarios.\nFor this reason, the main beneﬁt offered by solutions\
    \ in this category is the ability to prioritize the\nmitigation of DDoS attacks,\
    \ while taking into account the particular security requirements for each IoT\n\
    application, as discussed by Bawany and Shamsi [31]. On the other hand, Yan et\
    \ al. [42] recommend a\ndistributed and scalable architecture that is capable\
    \ of detecting malicious devices in the protected IoT\nnetwork itself. The solution\
    \ found by Sahay et al. [73] rely on trafﬁc ﬁltering based on a static amount\n\
    of trafﬁc to mitigate DDoS attacks in maritime communication systems. In general,\
    \ it has been seen\nthat solutions in this category have characteristic limitations,\
    \ such as (i) their failure to take note of\nattacks with low trafﬁc rates; and\
    \ (ii) restrictions on collaboration and maintenance caused by the fact\nthat\
    \ they were designed for a particular segment.\n6.4. Open Research Challenges\n\
    While the use of the SDN paradigm provides several beneﬁts to mitigate DDoS attacks,\
    \ in IoT\nscenarios, several underlying problems have not yet been addressed,\
    \ namely:\n6.4.1. Evaluation of Solutions Based on Realistic Scenarios\nAccording\
    \ to a recent report [17], DDoS attacks carried out in the third quarter of 2019\
    \ reached\nrates of up to 1Tbps, which shows a sharp rise in the volume of trafﬁc\
    \ subject to attacks, depending\non their type and purpose. Given this, the new\
    \ schemes must be evaluated in environments capable\nof replicating as many real\
    \ conditions as possible, both in terms of trafﬁc and infrastructure. The\ncombination\
    \ of these factors is crucial to ensuring the scalability of solutions in the\
    \ face of increasing\ndemand for trafﬁc and the heterogeneity of network infrastructures,\
    \ currently made up of both physical\nand virtual elements [19].\n6.4.2. Flexibility\
    \ to Meet Different Security Requirements\nIoT ecosystems are made up of a number\
    \ of applications with different communication and\nsecurity requirements (e.g.,\
    \ health and disaster recovery applications, trafﬁc control, and smart\nhomes).\
    \ As a result of the growing demand for mission-critical applications, often sharing\
    \ resources\nfrom general-purpose infrastructures, mitigation mechanisms must\
    \ be able to identify and prioritize\nmalicious ﬂows intended for this area. In\
    \ this way, detection and mitigation policies, for example,\ncan be reconﬁgured\
    \ at runtime.\n6.4.3. Mitigation of DDoS Attacks Based on IoT Protocols\nThe diversity\
    \ of the IoT ecosystem offers numerous opportunities for exploring protocols\n\
    (e.g., MQTT and CoAP), which have been specially designed to meet the demands\
    \ of new applications.\nFor instance, the CoAP protocol can be used for ampliﬁcation\
    \ attacks. Thus, several IoT devices can\nhave their IP addresses spoofed so that\
    \ attacks can be launched on different domains.\n6.5. Trends and Opportunities\n\
    This section highlights some emerging technologies that provide an opportunity\
    \ to assist the SDN\nparadigm in overcoming certain limitations and be able to\
    \ ﬁnd more efﬁcient and robust solutions to\nmitigate DDoS attacks in IoT environments.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 3078\n23 of 28\n6.5.1. Network Function Virtualization\nNetwork\
    \ Function Virtualization (NFV) [81] is a promising technology when integrated\
    \ with\nthe SDN paradigm for designing new solutions to mitigate DDoS attacks\
    \ in IoT environments.\nNFV introduces a new degree of ﬂexibility and scalability\
    \ by creating on-demand virtual network\nappliances such as ﬁrewalls, Intrusion\
    \ Detection Systems (IDS), and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)\nSystems. This feature\
    \ ensures that multiple instances of a speciﬁc mitigation mechanism can be\nimplemented\
    \ precisely at different locations on the network and address the constraints\
    \ imposed\nby the occurrence of malicious events [48]. Among the solutions obtained\
    \ from the use of the\nintegrated SDN and NFV to mitigate DDoS attacks are the\
    \ schemes employed by Zhou and Guo [82]\nand Krishnan et al. [63].\n6.5.2. Fog\
    \ Computing\nFog computing is a new architectural concept extending cloud computing,\
    \ which raise extensive\ncapabilities in affording the discovery of new SDN-based\
    \ mitigation solutions. Employing fog\ncomputing technology allows to access the\
    \ services offered by the public cloud at a faster data\nprocessing speed. Moreover,\
    \ the deployment of small clouds close to the vicinity of the end-user\ncan improve\
    \ conﬁdentiality while reduced latency at the same time. The strategies provided\n\
    in Yan et al. [42] and Özçelik et al. [56] are examples of solutions that harness\
    \ SDN-based architectures\nand fog computing to mitigate DDOS attacks in IoT environments.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nThis study created a taxonomy to describe and characterize strategies\
    \ to mitigate DDoS attacks\nharnessing SDN technologies in IoT environments. As\
    \ a result, we provide the following contributions:\n(i) a comprehensive review\
    \ of the state-of-the-art about DDoS attack mitigation strategies featured\nby\
    \ SDN technologies in IoT scenarios; (ii) a new classiﬁcation guide for the mitigation\
    \ strategies,\nwhich consider several relevant parameters; (iii) a full overview\
    \ of the existing mitigation techniques\nfor the IoT scenario; (iv) a comparative\
    \ analysis of the mitigation techniques through pre-deﬁned\nestablished criteria\
    \ supported by related studies, RFCs and other technical documents; and (v) a\
    \ broad\ndiscussion about open issues and research challenges regarding DDoS mitigation\
    \ featured by SDN\ntechnologies in IoT environments.\nThe proposed taxonomy takes\
    \ into account four (4) key characteristics associated with the\nmitigation process,\
    \ namely: (i) whether the solutions carry out the mitigation process in a centralized\n\
    or collaborative way; (ii) whether other technologies were used in conjunction\
    \ with SDN to carry out\nthe mitigation process (hybrid solutions); (iii) the\
    \ mitigation strategy employed; and (iv) the targeting\nIoT application scenario.\n\
    As a result of a thorough comparison between the analyzed solutions, conducted\
    \ through a deep\ninvestigation in the literature, we note that none of them addressed\
    \ all the factors that we claim to be\nregarded as of great signiﬁcance. However,\
    \ there were hybrid solutions that exploited the ability of\nthe blockchain, fog,\
    \ and cloud computing paradigms to provide distributed and highly collaborative\n\
    solutions, and enabled them to meet the requirements more satisfactorily.\nThe\
    \ beneﬁts and drawbacks found in the mitigation solutions that were designed for\
    \ several\ndifferent IoT scenarios were also analyzed to assist the scientiﬁc\
    \ community in ﬁnding solutions\ncapable of mitigating the most diverse types\
    \ of DDoS attacks. Thus, solutions that use malicious\nﬂow ﬁltering strategies\
    \ with the aid of machine learning algorithms have proved to be promising in\n\
    mitigating DDoS attacks when there are both high and low trafﬁc rates.\nFinally,\
    \ a list of new research challenges were identiﬁed with potentials to serve as\
    \ starting\npoints to undertake a new research project. Technologies with a high\
    \ potential for innovation are also\nrecommended when used in conjunction with\
    \ SDN.\nSensors 2020, 20, 3078\n24 of 28\nThe ﬁndings we obtained from the study\
    \ carried out in this paper provide the following\nprospective research directions.\
    \ We will run practical experiment trials atop a lab-premised testbed,\nwhereby\
    \ IoT use cases features real system dynamics and varying attack events. Based\
    \ on the\nparticular resource constraints of the IoT infrastructure, appropriate\
    \ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nare needed to provide optimal assessment\
    \ measuring. The high-accurate analysis and insights from\nthese real trials will\
    \ potential to drive reﬁnements in our current-proposed taxonomy.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  analysis: The article demonstrates a novel multiagent architecture that is built
    over the cloud computing paradigm. The multiagent architecture manages the information
    gathered by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for knowledge discovery and decision
    making in rural environments. The architecture successfully combines unsupervised
    and supervised learning techniques in its data analysis layer. This combination
    of learning techniques fulfills the challenging needs of WSNs by considering their
    resource-boundedness and real-time constraints. The article also highlights the
    flexibility and scalability of the proposed architecture, enabling it to be used
    with projects of varying sizes. Another important aspect of the article is its
    focus on managing and optimizing water resources in crop irrigation systems. It
    introduces a case study on maize cultivation to assess the architecture's effectiveness.
    The accuracy of the deployed WSN sensors and the optimization algorithms ensures
    that the system meets the specific irrigation needs of maize crops. Overall, the
    article provides valuable insights into the use of agent-based architectures for
    efficient water management in agricultural environments, particularly for crops
    with specific water requirements like maize.

    \ for\nhandling both small- and large-scale projects. The development of wireless\

    \ performance in optimizing the irrigation system in corn crops. The\narchitecture\

    \ for collecting the\ninformation needed by intelligent environments in urban\
    \ and\nrural construction, smart cities, home and building automa-\ntion, industrial\
    \ applications, or smart hospitals [1–6]. WSNs\nsupport current requirements related\
    \ to the deployment of\nnetworks; they cover communication needs and are flexible\n\
    in time, space, and autonomy; they do not require a fixed\nstructure [7–9]. Currently,\
    \ several wireless technologies are\navailable on the market such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,\
    \ or Bluetooth;\nthey enable easier deployments than wired ones, avoiding the\n\
    need to wire buildings and decrease the costs and drawbacks\nof the setup phase.\
    \ The possibilities provided by WSNs allow\ndeveloping a wide range of applications,\
    \ such as energy\ncost control, monitoring of environmental data, security and\n\
    control of access to environments, and industrial and home\nautomation [10–13].\
    \ In this regard, telemonitoring (or sens-\ning) makes it possible to obtain information\
    \ about users and\ntheir environment. This allows offering the users customized\n\
    online services, considering the state of their environment.\nThe building automation\
    \ and control system market provides\nmany standards, protocols, and data distribution\
    \ systems,\nenabling different systems, like building automation systems,\nsecurity\
    \ systems, lighting systems, and others, to interact and\nintegrate with each\
    \ other [14, 15].\nHindawi\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume\

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nThe development of WSN technology\
    \ has allowed extend-\ning its application to the rural setting where it can be\
    \ used to\nfacilitate the daily activities of farmers. People’s interaction\n\
    with the environment can be improved and the use of\n“smart” technologies can\
    \ also improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of rural systems. Mobile computing,\
    \ grid com-\nputing, pervasive microsensing and actuation [16, 17], and\nrecent\
    \ advancements in wireless technologies may change\nour surrounding environment\
    \ in a way that we have not yet\nimagined. These emerging technologies can be\
    \ used to create\nsmart environments and improve the socioeconomic status\nof\
    \ rural areas. The different applications of WSNs in rural\nenvironments can include\
    \ e-services such as e-learning, e-\nacademics, e-business, e-medicine, and e-healthcare.\
    \ Those\napplications may facilitate an efficient connection between\nthe city\
    \ and remote rural areas.\nOther applications of WSNs to the rural setting aim\n\
    to prevent environmental degradation because of fires in\nfarming and forest areas.\
    \ Fires lead to pollution and to the loss\nof nutrients and soil microorganisms\
    \ [18, 19]. It also causes\nvegetation degradation as well as flora and fauna\
    \ diminution\nsince they disappear from the affected zone and are not\nreintegrated\
    \ in other areas. The application of WSNs not only\nin preventive but also in\
    \ postfire detection systems is of great\nbenefit. The use of sensors to detect\
    \ and monitor fire behavior\nhas allowed applying new technologies in this area.\
    \ Sensors\nused in such systems measure static and dynamic variables,\nlike humidity,\
    \ slope of the land, the type of fuel, the direction,\nthe speed of the wind,\
    \ smoke, etc. Thanks to that, they provide\nknowledge of how the fire spreads\
    \ and how to combat it\nefficiently.\nAnother area to which WSNs are applied within\
    \ the rural\ncontext is agriculture and therefore the food industry. Sensors\n\
    can be applied to measure parameters and gather information\non environmental\
    \ conditions affecting plant growth in areas\nthat are not as easily controllable\
    \ as those of a greenhouse.\nThey are important for weather monitoring and optimal\
    \ use\nof fertilizers in the field. Besides that, they can be used in\nspatial\
    \ data collection, precision irrigation, and fertigation\nas well as disease and\
    \ insect pest management. As for food\nindustry, the applications involve real\
    \ time temperature mea-\nsurement for thermal sterilization, irradiation, etc.\
    \ Bacterial\nconcentration in food products can also be sensed.\nAn important\
    \ feature of WSNs deployed in a rural setting\nis that they can collect heterogeneous\
    \ data from different\nenvironments. In this way, systems can learn about the\n\
    environment, making it possible to take adequate decisions\nand easing knowledge\
    \ discovery. The goal of this approach\nis to provide a smart environment able\
    \ to make decisions\nand efficiently manage resources. The process of collecting\n\
    heterogeneous information is related to the term “Big Data”\n[20], which deals\
    \ with the volume, variety, velocity, and\ncomplexity of data produced daily.\
    \ Big Data not only brings\ntogether large amounts of data; the paradigm also\
    \ makes it\npossible to process various data types. These data streams\ndemand\
    \ ever-greater processing speeds and yet their storage\nmust be economic. The\
    \ main goal of Big Data in research\nand technologies is to manage and transform\
    \ available real\ntime and historical data into knowledge and to make efficient\n\
    decisions based on organizational requirements and needs.\nIn the presented solution\
    \ this will be done with the data\nrecovered by the sensors. It will allow us\
    \ to optimize the use\nof the actuators in the system. Like the pivots in the\
    \ irrigation\nprocess, we will optimize the spent water knowing where to\nspend\
    \ it in the correct moment.\nReal Time Locating Systems (RTLS) are an example\
    \ of\nanother important application of WSNs [21, 22]. Although\nsystems like GPS\
    \ or the future Galileo perform well in\noutdoor localization, indoor localization\
    \ still needs further\ndevelopment, especially with respect to accuracy and the\n\
    use of low-cost and efficient infrastructures. Some of the\napplications of Real\
    \ Time Locating Systems include tracking\npeople, assets, and animals, access\
    \ control, wander pre-\nvention, warning and alert systems, controlling security\n\
    perimeter, and resources optimization. Companies need to\nuse some sort of monitoring\
    \ system to track their human and\ntechnical resources and, especially, to improve\
    \ their security,\nefficiency, and safety and reduce occupational hazards. User\n\
    identification is a key aspect for adequate services customiza-\ntion and environment\
    \ interaction. A good example of this is\nemergency situations where it is necessary\
    \ to locate people,\nfor example, in the case of forest fires or nuclear disasters.\
    \ To\nbe able to develop a platform that would integrate different\nsubsystems\
    \ for remote location and automation, it is first\nnecessary to create complex\
    \ and flexible applications.\nThe goal of this research, therefore, is to design\
    \ and\ndevelop a multiagent architecture aimed at gathering data\nand automating\
    \ rural environments for decision making and\nknowledge discovery on a cloud system.\
    \ This architecture,\nwhich is based on agent virtual organizations (VOs), will\n\
    give intelligence to the platform, real time response, and\nadaptation to the\
    \ needs of the application problem; and\nthe cloud will ensure that the platform\
    \ uses the required\nresources at all times. Recent tendencies have led to the\
    \ use\nof VOs, which can be thought of as a set of individuals and\ninstitutions\
    \ that need to coordinate resources and services\nacross institutional boundaries.\
    \ Thus, a VO is an open system\nformed by the grouping and collaboration of heterogeneous\n\
    entities. The most suitable technology for the development\nof these open systems\
    \ is Agent Technology, which makes\nit possible to form dynamic agent organizations.\
    \ Modelling\nopen multiagent organizations makes it possible to describe\nstructural\
    \ composition (i.e., roles, agent groups, interaction\npatterns, and role relationships)\
    \ and functional behaviors\n(i.e., agent tasks, plans, or services), and it can\
    \ incorpo-\nrate normative regulations for controlling agent behaviors,\ndynamic\
    \ entry/exit of components, and dynamic formation\nof agent groups [23, 24]. As\
    \ the development of open multi-\nagent systems is still a recent field in the\
    \ multiagent system\nparadigm, it is necessary to investigate new methods for\n\
    modelling open agent-based virtual organizations and inno-\nvative techniques\
    \ that will provide advanced organizational\nabilities to virtual organizations.\
    \ In that sense, the intelligence\nprovided by proposed architecture is based\
    \ on union of\nsupervised and unsupervised learning. On the one hand, we\nprovide\
    \ a subsystem able to learn from past experiences or\nalready classified data,\
    \ which guarantees the automation of\nthe system in decision making. On the other\
    \ hand, it is not\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n3\nalways possible\
    \ to collect labeled data as in the previous case.\nFor that reason, we have linked\
    \ the previous subsystem with\nanother of unsupervised learning. The latter will\
    \ allow us to\nfind groupings in data based on their distribution, on which\n\
    we can later classify or label the data based on the knowledge\nobtained from\
    \ the groupings found. The subsystem above has\nbeen used in this research to\
    \ recognise different crop areas\n(of different needs) focused on their features,\
    \ disclosed by\ndifferent sensors measuring environmental condition of the\ncrop.\
    \ All of the above allows us to use resources only when\nand where they are needed\
    \ as a means of optimizing resources\nin crops.\nFinally, this paper has been\
    \ divided into the following\nsections to reach the proposed aims: the Related\
    \ Work which\ndescribes the background and the works related to this\nresearch\
    \ as well as the main contribution of this research.\nThe Multiagent Architecture\
    \ Methodology describes the\nmethod used to develop the architecture, i.e., discretion\
    \ of\nthe different layers of the architecture and the multiagent\nsystem involved.\
    \ The case study section describes the features\nof the corn crop and pivot-based\
    \ irrigation system. The results\nreached in this section are given as the final\
    \ part. Conclusions\nand references are listed at the end of this document.\n\
    2. Related Work\nThe challenge of adapting Information and Communication\nTechnologies\
    \ (ICT) to the needs of the agrifood sector lies\nin the complexity of the problem\
    \ it faces: great diversity\nof products, fast deterioration of fresh products,\
    \ binding of\nagricultural production to weather conditions, existence of\ndiseases\
    \ or pests, limitations in the evaluation of the product\nquality by the final\
    \ consumer, distances between production\nand consumption areas, etc. To deal\
    \ with these aspects, an\nautomatic decision-making-oriented analysis is required\
    \ for\nlarge volumes of heterogeneous data collected from different\nsources [25–28].\n\
    The above cases exemplify the flow of products in the\nagrifood domain, which\
    \ move from the agricultural sector to\nthe food industry (agrifood logistics)\
    \ and finally are delivered\nto the consumer (food awareness). Precision agriculture\
    \ in\nprimary production [29, 30], tracking and tracing of food\nproducts along\
    \ their value chain [31], or identification of\nproduct characteristics through\
    \ labels and logos targeted at\nthe consumer [32] showed important initiatives\
    \ supporting\nthe needs imposed by the sector and the consumer.\nThe use of WSNs\
    \ in the cases listed above has contributed\nto the development of systems that\
    \ continually improve their\nperformance. This has been a reality, especially\
    \ in networks\nof radio frequency identification devices (RFID), which are\nclosely\
    \ linked to the organization of interenterprise agrifood\nprocesses, ranging from\
    \ the farm to the distribution com-\npany [33]. However, the process of selecting\
    \ and specifying\ntechnologies that improve business processes is becoming\nincreasingly\
    \ complex, due to the wide variety of existing\ndevices and the rapid developments\
    \ in this field.\nRFID technology is currently one of the most promising\ntechnologies\
    \ in self-identification and data capture (AIDC).\nThe main objective of RFID\
    \ systems is to collect data through\na transponder (tag) so that they can be\
    \ transmitted and\nreceived by a transceiver, all through a wireless communica-\n\
    tion channel. The possibility of accessing information without\nthe need for visual\
    \ contact with the tags is exploited in the\nidentification or location of assets\
    \ [33, 34]. Such capacity is\nrelevant in food tracking and tracing systems, through\
    \ the\nidentification of batches of individual products. In addition,\nthe continued\
    \ development of RFID is generating new use\ncases that go beyond the identification\
    \ functionality. To this\nend, RFID is integrated with other technologies, such\
    \ as\nsensor technology [35–37].\nThe advantage of RFID technology lies in the\
    \ fact that\nit is cheap enough to be incorporated into any physical\ndevice,\
    \ while providing bidirectional communication capac-\nities, allowing building\
    \ advanced organizational schemes,\nsuch as the Internet of Things (IoT, (ITU,\
    \ 2005)). RFID can\ncreate new business models on global device networks, where\n\
    each object is networked. Current RFID implementations\nshow great potential and\
    \ RFID may become a catalyst of\ntechnical evolution in the industrial sector\
    \ [38–40].\nIn general, agrofood data collection technology is char-\nacterized\
    \ by a wide variety of active devices in different\nparts/environments. The following\
    \ are the most common\nexamples in the majority of use cases [26]:\n(i) Data collection\
    \ on farms through the implementation\nof wireless sensor networks: they provide\
    \ information\non production indicators like precipitation, soil mois-\nture levels,\
    \ pesticide and fertilizer use, and more.\n(ii) Transport data capture: It includes\
    \ the location and\ninformation of the environment and data both inside\nand outside\
    \ the transport system, which allows us to\nknow the state of logistics.\n(iii)\
    \ Data capture of product quality indicators: the levels\nof humidity, oxygen,\
    \ nitrogen, and ethylene in the air\nact as indicators of the state of fruit and\
    \ vegetables,\nbeing relevant in storage and transport tasks.\n(iv) Data capture\
    \ from product packaging (logos and\nother) is to collect additional product information\
    \ on\ncloud.\nFocusing on the agricultural use case, small and medium\nsized farms\
    \ carry most of the weight of world production.\nEven though they are slower to\
    \ adopt IT solutions, due to\nlack of familiarity with technologies, belief that\
    \ the cost-\nbenefit ratio does not suit their needs or due to their lack of\n\
    knowledge they are not able to make use of the large amount\nof information that\
    \ these systems acquire [41]. Solutions\nto such problems may be found in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nFor example, the conferences of the International Society of\n\
    Precision Agriculture (ISPA, 2012) aim to collect information\nfor accounting\
    \ purposes and its subsequent automation. This\nimplies increased agricultural\
    \ automation and improvements\nin environmental technologies.\nIn this area, wireless\
    \ sensor network applications for\nirrigation facilities management based on radio\
    \ frequency\nidentification have been proposed in [42, 43]. Those applica-\ntions\
    \ were determined to be beneficial in the management of\nwater. This kind of systems\
    \ collect, analyse, and monitor data\n4\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    from a net of sensors installed in the field in a feedback loop\nwhich activates\
    \ the control devices based on precalculated\nthreshold value, like in [44]. Some\
    \ other works develop\napplications to allow the user to interact with the system\n\
    and make dynamical thresholds [45, 46]. Other systems,\ninstead of just thresholds,\
    \ do use linear programming models\nto optimize the resources like in [47]. Here\
    \ the authors\ncombine the idea of “knapsack” problem with a linear\nprogramming\
    \ model proving satisfactory results. The novelty\nof our solution is that it\
    \ proposes a combination of supervised\nand unsupervised learning, where, according\
    \ to the nature\nof the data, clustering and/or machine learning methods\nare\
    \ used for task optimization in the use of resources,\nwhile improving the crop\
    \ quality. Nowadays, in WSN based\nsystems, two computational paradigms are arising:\
    \ edge and\nfog computing. Regarding farming and precision agriculture,\nin [48]\
    \ the edge computing paradigm has been used in order\nto make the data they use\
    \ more private. To obtain this, the IoT\nsensors (edges) preprocess and analyse\
    \ the private data and\nsend the results to a server, where the results to estimate\
    \ and\npredict the total harvest yield are gathered. In [49], the above\nparadigms\
    \ have been used to create a smart farm monitoring\nsystem. The works previously\
    \ exposed deployed WSN inside\na building, but our solution deploys it in open\
    \ fields. IoT\ndevices are in the open field, so it is difficult to use a computer\n\
    with enough computing power to process all this data in\na fog computing way.\
    \ Furthermore, if the devices are not\nlightweight and compute the data in an\
    \ edge manner, the\nenergy consumed would be greater and it would mean that it\n\
    is needed to spend resources considering the batteries. That is\nwhy, instead\
    \ of trying fog or edge computing paradigms, we\nmust use the cloud computing\
    \ one.\n3. Multiagent Architecture Methodology\nThe main goal of this research\
    \ consists in the design and\ndevelopment of a new and innovative multiagent architec-\n\
    ture based on virtual organizations, capable of managing\nthe information collected\
    \ by wireless sensor networks (e.g.,\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, and GPRS)\
    \ for knowledge\ndiscovery and decision making in rural environments. The\nimplementation\
    \ of a prototype of this architecture has been\ndeveloped with Java (64-bits)\
    \ under the Java Agent Develop-\nment framework (JADE). The tests have been performed\
    \ on\na PC server model: PowerEdge R330, CPU: 4 CPUS x Intel\n\x02 Xeon \x02 CPU\
    \ E3-1220 v6 @ 3.00GHz, RAM: 31.83 GB, OS:\nVMware ESXi 6.5, and HDD: 1T.\nWireless\
    \ Sensor networks (WSNs) fall into the cate-\ngory of complex, distributed, interconnected\
    \ and rapidly\nchanging systems. Multiagent systems (MAS) have been\nidentified\
    \ as one of the most suitable artificial intelligence\nparadigms in the development\
    \ of WSNs, since MASs are\nrobust and autonomous in providing formalisms, algorithms,\n\
    and methodologies in satisfying the challenging needs of\nWSNs. Specifically,\
    \ MAS provide adaptiveness, decentralised\ncontrol, large scale, information uncertainty,\
    \ resource bound-\nedness, and physical distribution [23].\nThe proposed multiagent\
    \ platform will be built over the\ncloud computing paradigm to provide better\
    \ flexibility and\nhigher scalability for handling both, small- and large-scale\n\
    projects (e.g., individual homes, large hospitals, or even smart\ncities). Cloud\
    \ Computing can offer a very powerful, reli-\nable, predictable, and scalable\
    \ computing infrastructure for\nrunning multiagent systems by implementing agent-based\n\
    complex applications. These applications can rely on cloud\ncomputing infrastructures\
    \ to access and use vast amounts\nof processors and data. One key feature of software\
    \ agents\nis intelligence to solve complex problems. Such intelligence\ncan be\
    \ obtained through the collaboration of several agents\nrunning in a distributed\
    \ environment. The choice of cloud\ncomputing meets the requirements of MAS, providing\
    \ a\ndistributed environment and ensuring low runtimes and high\nperformance.\n\
    3.1. Multilayer and Multiagent Architecture. This subsection\ndescribes the multilayer\
    \ organization of the multiagent archi-\ntecture proposed in Figure 1. Each layer\
    \ shows an abstraction\nlevel by involving a different degree of gathering and\
    \ process-\ning information. The abstraction level implemented in each\nlayer\
    \ allows it to isolate itself from the responsibilities of its\nneighbouring layers.\
    \ This also makes it possible to decouple\nand reuse system components, giving\
    \ a greater adaptation to\nthe environment. Then, the responsibilities of each\
    \ layer can\nbe described as follows:\n(i) Layer 0: This layer is the physical\
    \ one, in which the\nnetwork of sensors and actuators of the system is\ndeployed.\
    \ Those devices can be based on different\ntechnologies and communication protocols,\
    \ Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, GPRS, etc., depending on\nthe characteristics\
    \ of the terrain where the system is\ndeployed.\n(ii) Layer 1: This is the data\
    \ receiving layer, which contains\nthe agents responsible for capturing the information\n\
    from the sensors and routing them to the upper layers\nto transform them into\
    \ a common format defined in\nthe platform. This layer is also responsible for\
    \ routing\nthe orders obtained from the upper layers to the\nactuators.\n(iii)\
    \ Layer 2: This is the data transformation and storage\nlayer. In this layer,\
    \ the data are transformed to a\ndetermined format, depending on the purpose for\n\
    which they will be used. For example, data collected\nfrom sensors need to be\
    \ merged before they are\nanalysed in the upper layers or are requested by\nactuators\
    \ in the physical layer. This layer is also\nresponsible for storing the captured\
    \ data to create a\nhistory for further analysis.\n(iv) Layer 3 (data analysis\
    \ layer): This is the layer where\nknowledge is discovered through the agents\
    \ responsi-\nble for the analysis of the collected information. This\nlayer defines\
    \ agents in charge of performing com-\nputations and applying supervised and unsupervised\n\
    learning techniques. Therefore, this layer makes it\npossible to take decisions\
    \ based on the collected data,\ngiving the most important part of the intelligence\
    \ of\nthe system.\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n5\nCloud management\
    \ layer\nPERSISTENCE\nDEPLOYMENT\nCOMPUTATION\nLAYER 0: Physical layer implementing\
    \ the deployment of\nsensors based on different technologies, Namely, Wi-Fi,\n\
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, GPRS,...\nLAYER 1: Data receiving layer, agent virtual\
    \ organization\nresponsible for capturing data from sensors and sending\nthem\
    \ to be processed by other virtual organizations.\nLAYER 2: Data transformation\
    \ layer, agent virtual\norganization responsible for transforming data to\ndetermined\
    \ formats, compatible with the architecture.\nLAYER 3: Data analytics layer, agent\
    \ virtual organization of\nknowledge discovery from data gathered in LAYER 2.\
    \ It\ndevelops methods of Supervised and unsupervised learning.\nGathering and\
    \ processing data\nKnowledge discovery process and decision making\nLAYER 4: User\
    \ interface layer, agent virtual organization of\nuser interaction in charge of\
    \ performing the user requests.\nMultilayer and Cloud Computing Architecture\n\
    for Knowledge Discovery from Rural Environments\nFigure 1: Organizational representation\
    \ of the agent-based multilayer architecture proposed for knowledge discovery\
    \ from rural areas. The\narchitecture has been designed under the cloud computing\
    \ paradigm.\n(v) Layer 4: This is the user interface layer, which interacts\n\
    with and fulfils the requests of system users. The rest\nof the layers back up\
    \ this layer to provide services such\nas process and device monitoring, analysis\
    \ of stored\ndata, and information visualization.\n3.2. Architecture Multiagent\
    \ System. The proposed architec-\nture’s multiagent system (MAS) is developed\
    \ based on virtual\norganizations (VOs), which perform previously defined tasks\n\
    in the architecture layers. As shown in Figure 2, several\nlinked VOs and agents\
    \ govern the proposed multiagent\nsystem, performing different roles to meet their\
    \ individual\ngoals that contribute to reaching the common goal of the\nsystem.\
    \ Each VO consists of a set of agents with specific roles\nwithin the organization.\
    \ Agents perform their tasks/roles and\ncollaborate with other agents from the\
    \ VO to achieve the\nobjectives of the organization. In addition, the introduced\n\
    MAS responds to the needs of each layer given in Figure 1;\nit has also been adapted\
    \ to manage and/or optimize the water\nflow in automatic irrigation systems for\
    \ crops. Thus, the aim\nof applying the MAS illustrated in Figure 2 to crop irrigation\n\
    systems is to incorporate intelligence into the irrigation\nprocess, allowing\
    \ the minimisation of water consumption.\nBelow, the roles of the agents and of\
    \ MAS VOs are described:\n(i) Manager agent (MA): This agent acts as a mediator\n\
    between VOs and agents defined in the MAS, and it is\nresponsible for coordinating\
    \ the operations between\nthem. The MA is primarily responsible for the man-\n\
    agement of agents that are encompassed within it.\nTherefore, it allows for the\
    \ creation and management\nof the life cycle of an organization or agent.\n(ii)\
    \ Heterogeneous data supervisor agent (HDMA): This\nagent handles communication\
    \ between the DRVO\nand DTVO organizations. Thus, HDMA receives all\nheterogeneous\
    \ data (data from different sensors have\ndifferent formats) collected by the\
    \ DRVO organi-\nzation and sends them to a specific agent in the\n6\nWireless\

    Figure 2: Flowchart of the agent virtual organizations integrating the multiagent\
    \ system for the control of irrigation in rural areas, such as\ncrops.\nDTVO organization,\
    \ which will convert the received\ndata into an internal common format and store\n\
    them in the corresponding database for their later\nretrieval. HDMA is also responsible\
    \ for providing\ndata (through the MA agent), in an indicated format,\nfrom the\
    \ previous VOs to the rest of entities in the\nMAS.\n(iii) Irrigation manager\
    \ agent (IMA): This agent manages\nthe automatic irrigation system in crops. This\
    \ agent\nconverts the results given by the KDVO organi-\nzation into an action\
    \ that is to be performed by\nthe irrigation control device. To do this, each\
    \ data\nanalysis result from KDVO is encoded to a bit\nsequence, which is interpreted\
    \ as an action or set\nof actions that are to be performed by the coupled\nirrigation\
    \ system. Such actions may be to start or stop\nwatering, increase or decrease\
    \ the water flow for a\ndetermined area of the crop, irrigate only a specified\n\
    number of crop areas, etc. In addition, this agent can\ncommunicate the activities\
    \ the irrigation system is\nperforming at any time, i.e., the activity that is\
    \ being\nperformed.\n(iv) UIVO virtual organization: This organization inter-\n\
    acts with the system users through a system interface\n(agent IA) where the user\
    \ can make requests in\nrelation to the activities being performed on the\ncrop,\
    \ obtain or analyse information from historical\ndata stored on the database,\
    \ and monitor sensors of\nthe crop or of a crop area. For such purposes, MA\n\
    and DAA agents communicate with the remaining\nentities (through the manager agent)\
    \ of the MAS to\nperform the tasks requested by users. Meanwhile, the\nMA agent\
    \ (in UIVO) starts the monitoring process\nthrough the DRVO organization and the\
    \ manager\nand HDMA agents. Also, the DAA agent starts the\nprocess of intelligent\
    \ analysis of the historical data by\nrunning the manager and HDMA agents along\
    \ with\nthe KDVO and DTVO organizations.\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    7\n(v) DRVO virtual organization: This VO groups the\nagents responsible for gathering\
    \ sensor data and is\ncomposed of an agent set, called DCAs (data capture\nagents).\
    \ Each DCA agent captures data from a sensor\ntype, so each agent is designated\
    \ for obtaining data\nfrom a particular sensor type, so that each agent\nmanages\
    \ several sensors of the same type and each\nagent is specialised in one type\
    \ of sensor. In addition\nto information gathered on the environmental fac-\n\
    tors measured by sensors, information such as crop\nidentifier, sensor, and area\
    \ where the sensor is located\nare also included. Note that the proposed architecture\n\
    and MAS have been designed to manage more than\none crop at a time.\n(vi) DTVO\
    \ virtual organization: This VO groups the\nagents that transform data from one\
    \ format into\nanother. Since data obtained from sensors in crops\nare heterogeneous,\
    \ it is necessary to convert such data\nto a common format that can be used by\
    \ the MAS.\nBasically, it is about converting the captured data\ninto the internal\
    \ structure of the database where the\nMAS implements and achieves the inverse\
    \ operation\nto such a conversion (i.e., from the database to\nanother format)\
    \ when it is requested. DTVO is also in\ncharge of storing converted data in the\
    \ corresponding\ndatabase and running queries on them. Each data\nformat agent\
    \ in this VO is an expert in one or more\nconversions of data formats. Note that\
    \ each database\nassociated with these agents corresponds to a different\ncrop,\
    \ in case the system manages more than one crop.\nFinally, DTVO is important for\
    \ the MAS because\nof the great number of heterogeneous data gathered\nfrom sensors.\n\
    (vii) KDVO virtual organization: This VO provides the\nMAS with intelligence by\
    \ incorporating agents based\non supervised and unsupervised learning. Thus,\n\
    KDVO oversees the knowledge discovery process\nfrom historical data which are\
    \ obtained from the\nsensors deployed in crops and stored in their corre-\nsponding\
    \ database. This allows us to find patterns in\nthe data and predict their behaviors\
    \ under different\ncircumstances. KDVO consists of five related agents\nas explained\
    \ below:\n(i) KMA agent: This agent provides the infor-\nmation needed by the\
    \ rest of agents of the\norganization to perform their tasks, so that\nKMA is\
    \ the link between external entities and\nthe VO; moreover, it determines the\
    \ agents to\nused and who will collaborate to solve data\nanalysis requests. Thus,\
    \ not all the agents of\nthe organization are used in a data analysis\nprocess\
    \ and the selection of the agents to be\nused depends on the type of presented\
    \ problem.\nFinally, KMA is also responsible for formatting\nthe collected data\
    \ to a dataset that can be\ngiven as input to the remaining agents of the\nVO.\n\
    (ii) CA agent: This agent collaborates with the rest of\nagents of the VO by providing\
    \ complex compu-\ntations from the data. CA applies predetermined\nformulas (statistical\
    \ computation) to collected\ndata such as temperature, relative humidity, and\n\
    CO2, to figure out the needs of the crop. One\nof the aims pursued by the formulas\
    \ above is to\nreach a precision irrigation and fertigation, as\nwell as disease\
    \ and insect pest management. But\nCA is only a part of the whole learning process\n\
    that allows knowledge discovery.\n(iii) ULA agent: This is the unsupervised learning\n\
    agent, which implements algorithms to be run\non unlabeled datasets. ULA is useful\
    \ when data\nhave not been classified into different groups,\nfor which a decision\
    \ must be made. This agent\nincludes different clustering algorithms such as,\n\
    Agnes, Diana, and Eisen [50]. These algorithms\nare applied to group similar areas\
    \ based on\nvalues gathered from the sensors located in\ndifferent areas of the\
    \ crop and make decisions\naccordingly. Note that a given crop area is\nidentified\
    \ by the values reported by its sen-\nsors. Hence, each area defines several sensor\n\
    groups of the same type. This way, each area\nis represented by an n-tuple (a\
    \ vector), where\neach component has a mean environmental\nvalue computed from\
    \ sensors of the same type.\nThus, the clustering algorithms group vectors\nstanding\
    \ for the features of each area of the crop.\n(iv) MLA agent: This agent performs\
    \ machine learn-\ning strategies when data are labeled to find\npatterns. This\
    \ agent builds classifiers whose pre-\ndiction is used in decision making or converted\n\
    to an action carried out in the crop. The above\nmeans that the resources used\
    \ in crops are\noptimized. This agent develops a Support Vec-\ntor Machine (SVM),\
    \ Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) and naive Bayes classifier [51].\n(v) CBR agent:\
    \ This agent performs case-based\nreasoning and similarly to the agent above it\
    \ is\nconvenient for situations where there is a set\nof cases and experience\
    \ in decision making to\nsolve a particular type of problems. Based on\npast experience,\
    \ CBR retrieves the most similar\ncase to the one to solve and adapt the solution\
    \ to\nsolve the new case. The new case and its solution\nare stored in the corresponding\
    \ knowledge base\nwhich will be used in the future to solve new\nproblems. For\
    \ the case that concerns us, a\ncase is represented as a value n-tuple being\n\
    environmental factor captured from sensors\nlocated in different areas of a crop.\
    \ A case-\nsolution means an action to be performed in\nthe crop like irrigation,\
    \ fertigation, and disease\nand insect pest management, among others. In\ngeneral,\
    \ a solution to a case means a decision\nmaking on the target rural area. Furthermore,\n\
    8\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nthe Euclidean distance is used\
    \ by default to\nrecover similar cases from knowledge base. Note\nthat the CBR\
    \ agent manages a knowledge base\nfor each crop, if needed.\nFinally, consider\
    \ that not all agents in this VO must be used in\na case study. Agents to be used\
    \ as well as their collaboration\nto solve a case study depend on the characteristics\
    \ imposed\nby the case study.\nA cloud system has been employed, as it allows\
    \ us to\napproach in real time, to adapt the response in real time\nand the context\
    \ of the case study, although edge computing\nmay be a more suitable way to optimize\
    \ processes, reducing\nlatencies, and consumption of less bandwidth [52]. However,\n\
    our system sends all data to the cloud at all times, immediately\naccessing the\
    \ results of the analysis and evaluation of the\nstatus of all these sensors and\
    \ devices. Note that although\nthe proposed architecture does not develop a complete\
    \ Big\nData system, some of the Big Data features are present in\nthe different\
    \ VOs. Features such as data capture in DRVO,\ndata storage with different formats\
    \ in DTVO, intelligent\ndata analysis through KDVO, and visualization and querying\n\
    in UIVO are key to define an architecture following the\nprinciples of Big Data\
    \ analytics. Thus, our proposal has\ndeveloped the basis to manage in the future,\
    \ volume, variety,\nand velocity in generated data.\n4. Case Study on Irrigation\
    \ in Corn Crops\nThis section details how the presented architecture adapts\n\
    to efficient management of agricultural environments. The\narchitecture adapts\
    \ to factors that change frequently (weather\nconditions) and have a critical\
    \ impact on the development\nof crops. Because the architecture is agent-based,\
    \ it has\nfeatures such as self-adaptation to dynamic environments,\nwhich allows\
    \ us to manage data from a variety of sources,\nextract knowledge, learn from\
    \ previous actions, and make\ndecisions within the context in which the system\
    \ is deployed.\nThe architecture monitors the factors that impact the crops’\n\
    watering needs; by controlling the irrigation system it covers\nthe hydrological\
    \ part and at the same time optimizes the use\nof water in crop irrigation.\n\
    4.1. Description of the Corn Crop. This subsection details\nthe scenario in which\
    \ the architecture based on virtual\nagent organizations has been implemented.\
    \ The architecture\nhas been deployed on an agricultural land of 40ha used\nfor\
    \ the cultivation of corn in the province of Salamanca,\nSpain (Table 1). This\
    \ allowed us to measure the architecture’s\neffectiveness in terms of adaptation\
    \ to the context, data\nmanagement, analysis, and optimization decisions in the\n\
    process of irrigating the crop. The surface of the crop was\ndivided into two\
    \ parts, one in which the corn will be\ntraditionally cultivated by irrigation\
    \ with pivot (control crop)\nwhile the other part involves irrigation with pivot\
    \ but the\nsystem will be managed through our platform (test crop).\nThe corn\
    \ crop is characterized by being a short-cycle crop\nand with a variable water\
    \ demand during the growth stage.\nThe crop surface was loose and aired at the\
    \ time of cultivation,\nTable 1: Geological characteristics of the corn crop in\

    \ for the crop due to poor absorption of\nmineral nutrients and water.\n4.2. Description\
    \ of the Irrigation. The traditional method\nof watering crops was called flood\
    \ irrigation. Since a few\nyears, this method has been replaced by drip irrigation.\n\
    However, automotive irrigation has many advantages over\ndrip irrigation because\
    \ it is more efficient; it covers long\ndistances and adapts to the plot and above\
    \ all; it allows\nautomating the irrigation process. This case study uses a pivot\n\
    that has a circular displacement, so the distribution of water is\nvery uneven\
    \ along the side: little water is needed at the centre,\nbeing further away from\
    \ the centre leads to the requirement\nof more water as there are more square\
    \ meters to cover. The\ntowers are moved by small electric motors (0.5-1.5 HP)\
    \ at very\nslow and adjustable speed. While the machine is advancing,\nirrigation\
    \ is taking place. Then, the pivot used in the corn\nWireless Communications and\
    \ Mobile Computing\n9\n55m\n14m\nFigure 3: Structure of the pivot used in the\
    \ presented case study.\ncrop (see Figure 3) consists of 3 towers of 55 meters\
    \ and\nan overhang of 14 meters with a high-speed motor of 1.5HP\nat 86rpm at\
    \ 60Hz that moves at 2.3m/min. The end-gun is\nlocated at the tip of the overhang\
    \ with a section of 127, and\nthe sprinklers are rotor type, with a ground clearance\
    \ height\nof 4.40m. The system has a 52,000l sprinkler chart to cover\nthe needs\
    \ of a 20ha land.\nThe pivot irrigation system is automated by the IMA\nagent.\
    \ This agent makes decisions based on the information\ncollected from the WSN\
    \ and sends commands to the irri-\ngation control device. The deployed WSN allows\
    \ the agents\nfrom the DRVO VO to collect the data necessary to determine\nthe\
    \ amount of water the crop needs and to command the\npivot to move and irrigate.\
    \ WSN sensors collect temperature,\nhumidity, wind, height, or light hours temperature.\
    \ These\nparameters influence the water needs of maize and allow\nthe architecture\
    \ to adjust irrigation and in this way optimize\nwater consumption. When temperatures\
    \ are high, plants will\nabsorb more water from the soil, as perspiration increases.\n\
    The corn crop that is at sea level needs more water because the\nsoil in which\
    \ it grows is warmer than that of a crop growing\nat higher altitudes. Ambient\
    \ humidity provides the amount\nof actual water vapour contained in the air and\
    \ the amount\nof water vapour it would need to contain to saturate it at the\n\
    same temperature. Wind causes water to be lost or the land to\ndry faster.\nTo\
    \ control the above issues, the KDVO virtual organi-\nzation is in charge of finding\
    \ out how much water a crop\nloses through evapotranspiration, ETc. This amount\
    \ of water\nis defined as the crop’s water requirement and it must be\nsupplied.\
    \ The CA agent calculates the water lost by ETc evap-\notranspiration using the\
    \ climatic parameters (temperature,\nhumidity, wind, precipitation, and solar\
    \ radiation). To this\nend, the Penman Monteith [53] method was used in the\n\
    architecture to determine the evapotranspiration rate, ETo.\n\U0001D438\U0001D447\

    \ losses, it is\nnecessary to calculate the net water requirements of the\ncrop\
    \ (Nn). To optimize the water used in irrigation, the\nsystem must consider the\
    \ level of precipitation. Rain allows\nreducing the amount of water used by the\
    \ pivot. Where Pe\nis efficient precipitation, architecture has considered 75%\

    the water used by the pivot. However, not all rainfall is\nuseful; among other\
    \ factors losses are caused by excessive\ndryness, wind, or runoff. For this reason,\
    \ the architecture\nconsidered 75% of precipitation as effective precipitation\
    \ (Pe).\nWith effective precipitation, the system has estimated net\nrequirements\
    \ (Nn) for maize in mm/month. The architecture\ncalculated the amount of water\
    \ that the cultivated area (Nn)\nhas to receive in order to satisfy the needs\
    \ of the plants\nand have the maximum possible production, insofar as it\ndepends\
    \ on the water. In calculating net requirements, it was\nconsidered that the case\
    \ study uses a central pivot irrigation\nsystem, which has an efficiency ratio\
    \ of 85%. In Table 5 we can\nsee the needs of the corn cultivation.\nAs the pivot\
    \ used in the case study has 3 towers with a\nseparation of 55m each and an overhang\
    \ of end-gun (14m),\nthe last tower is located 165m from the central pivot. In\n\
    addition, the pivot moves at a speed of 1.6m/min, so it needs\nas much time as\
    \ follows.\nTime = 2\U0001D70F ∗ 165\n2.3\n= 450.52min = 27031.2\U0001D460\n=\
    \ 7ℎ 30min\n(9)\nIn a full turn, the pivot needs 7 hours and 30 minutes\napproximately\
    \ to water the 20ha. This allows for a sufficient\nnumber of irrigations per month\
    \ to cover for the needs\nof the crop (7). With the time required by the pivot,\
    \ the\nirrigation frequency of the pivot and the minimum flow rate\nare calculated.\
    \ To calculate the least flow rate feeding the\npivot, attention is paid to the\
    \ needs of the maize crop, the area\nunder cultivation, and the time available\
    \ for irrigation (value\nset at 18h), according to formula (5).\nThe pivot has\
    \ used 1002.06mm (1002.06l/m2-10020.6m3/\nha) over the time the corn crop was\
    \ cultivated, as shown in\nTable 6. These results were obtained with the traditional\
    \ pivot\nirrigation system.\nThe following are the changes brought about by the\n\
    architecture designed to achieve savings in the amount of\nwater used to irrigate\
    \ the crop. As shown in Figure 4, the\ngoal of optimizing the irrigation system\
    \ is to identify the\ncrop areas with greater and lesser irrigation needs; these\
    \ are\nidentified by the multiagent system (MAS) and the irrigation\nsystem supplies\
    \ water to these areas. Since each area is\ncharacterized by distinct features,\
    \ a set of different types of\nsensors is deployed in each one, in order to measure\
    \ different\nsoil, plant, and environmental parameters. Then, each area in\nthe\
    \ figure is identified by the MAS through a vector of values\ngiven by the sensors.\
    \ Once the feature values are obtained\nfor each area of the crop, the Agnes clustering\
    \ algorithm\n(Euclidean distance used as a metric in the data) is run by\nthe\
    \ MAS (KDVO virtual organization) to build similar area\nclusters. KDVO runs the\
    \ ULA agent by passing a dataset\nwith the feature of each area of the crop. The\
    \ ULA agent\nruns the Agnes clustering algorithm to identify different crop\n\
    subtypes; in this case, two subtypes of crops (irrigation and\nnonirrigation)\
    \ have been identified for all areas given in the\ninput dataset. Therefore, the\
    \ clustering algorithm will find\ntwo area groupings (clusters) with different\
    \ features: one\ngrouping may show that its areas need to be irrigated with\n\
    less or more water, whereas the other grouping can indicate\nthat they do not\
    \ require any irrigation. Then, once the areas\nhave been classified into two\
    \ groups (or more if needed),\nthis result is sent to the IMA agent through the\
    \ manager\nagent. The IMA agent encodes the result-clustering into a bit\nsequence\
    \ (a binary number), which associates each area of\nthe crop with its need for\
    \ irrigation. The IMA agent sends the\nbit sequence to the irrigation control\
    \ device, which interprets\nsuch a sequence as an order that becomes an irrigation\
    \ action\nfor the crop.\nThus, the goal of detecting similar area clusters is\
    \ to\nmanage and optimize the irrigation system. The MAS clusters\nsimilar areas\
    \ (in this case study, two types of area clusters) of\nthe crop to optimize the\
    \ water flow per area. In this case study,\nwe have selected two clusters, identifying\
    \ the areas that need\nmore or less water. Thus, the MAS builds a binary number\n\
    whose digits are related to each area. “1” means that the\ncorresponding area\
    \ needs irrigation while “0” means that no\nirrigation is necessary for that area.\
    \ Therefore, the irrigation\nsystem will just supply water (less or more water)\
    \ in areas with\nvalue “1” as shown in the irrigation system shown in Figure 4.\n\

    \ presented an architecture based on virtual\norganizations that allows localized\
    \ irrigation using a pivot.\nIt is an innovative approach that makes full use\
    \ of the\nadvantages of pivot irrigation (more economical choice)\nand the advantages\
    \ of localized irrigation (lower water con-\nsumption), eliminating the disadvantages\
    \ of pivot irrigation\n(higher water consumption vs. localized irrigation). The\
    \ use\nof a system of agents in this efficient water management\nproblem allowed\
    \ us to monitor the status of the corn crop\nand coordinate the pivot to irrigate\
    \ in localized areas releasing\nthe necessary amount of water. The hypothesis\
    \ proposed in\nthis study (that the consumption of water used for pivot\nirrigation\
    \ is similar to the amount of water required if\nthe localized irrigation method\
    \ is used) combines a series\nof needs (sensor data collection, fusion of information,\n\
    information processing, and decision making, among others)\nthat makes it necessary\
    \ to develop an architecture based\non an organization of virtual agents which\
    \ controls all the\nparameters that influence the irrigation decision (temper-\n\
    ature, humidity, wind, radiation, precipitation, soil salinity,\netc.) in a crop\
    \ by means of a WSN.\nAgent-based virtual organizations use data from the\nsensor\
    \ network deployed in the area of the case study crop.\nThe results showed that\
    \ the use of a VO MAS system was\nessential for optimizing the water used in crop\
    \ irrigation. The\npossibility of programming the pivot to irrigate allows the\n\
    VO MAS to send the architecture’s orders to the irrigation\nsystem, with the aim\
    \ of optimizing the amount of water used\nand the frequency of irrigation according\
    \ to the climatic\n12\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nTable 7:\

    \ From the results of the case study, we can\nsee that the performance of the\
    \ system allowed obtaining a\nreduction of 12.68% with respect to the crop area\
    \ that was\nmade by pivot but was not controlled by the VO MAS. Since\nthe percentage\
    \ was higher than 11%, we can deduce that\nthe MAS VOI achieves similar saving\
    \ to localized irrigation.\nHowever, MAS VOI does not entail the disadvantages\
    \ that\nlocalized irrigation does, for example, the difficulties in\nhaving to\
    \ deploy a distribution network in each harvest, the\ndifficulties when using\
    \ machinery on the surface of the crop,\nand the complication of deploying it\
    \ in large areas.\nFinally, automotive irrigation was used thanks to the\npossibility\
    \ of automating irrigation. It was even possible to\nirrigate only certain areas\
    \ of the crop surface if the architec-\nture decided so, according to the collected\
    \ data. Although\nlocalized irrigation consumes 11% less than automotive irri-\n\
    gation according to the literature, the fact that automotive\nirrigation was managed\
    \ by the architecture allowed us to\nobtain a higher optimization percentage.\
    \ Complementing\nthe above, we want to stress that, due to the ability of the\n\
    proposed architecture and its multiagent system to adapt and\nbe extensible, it\
    \ can be applied to other types of crops and\nwith a different geometry.\nData\

  analysis: "Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)\
    \ and their collection and use\nThis systematic review on automated systems for\
    \ real-time irrigation management systems integrates IoT and machine learning\
    \ technologies that address the limitations of existing state-of-the-art end-to-end\
    \ technology for irrigation management. Their intention is to critically assess\
    \ the current state and future potential of real-time irrigation management systems.\
    \ The review specifically focuses on the initial stages of the automated irrigation\
    \ management pipeline, covering data collection, edge and fog computing, real-time\
    \ data transmission protocols and technologies, and the challenges and solutions\
    \ associated with real-time data transmission. \nThe three most relevant verbatim\
    \ quotes from the paper, each no more than 3 sentences, demonstrating its pertinence\
    \ to the outline point and review question are as follows:\n1. “Real-time monitoring\
    \ of soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather, pests, and diseases can provide\
    \ a wealth of information that can be used to optimize irrigation schedules and\
    \ improve crop yields. However, collecting and transmitting this data in a timely\
    \ and reliable manner can be a challenge, especially in large-scale or remote\
    \ farming operations.” \n2. “Edge and fog computing can play a key role in enabling\
    \ real-time irrigation management systems by providing a way to collect, process,\
    \ and store data close to the source. This can reduce latency and improve reliability,\
    \ which is critical for applications that require real-time decision-making.”\
    \ \n3. “Real-time irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly\
    \ improve water use efficiency in agriculture. By providing farmers with real-time\
    \ information on soil moisture, canopy temperature, and other factors, these systems\
    \ can help them to make more informed decisions about when and how much to irrigate\
    \ their crops. This can lead to reduced water use, increased crop yields, and\
    \ improved profitability.”\nOverall, this systematic review provides a comprehensive\
    \ overview of the current state and future potential of real-time irrigation management\
    \ systems. It highlights the challenges and solutions associated with real-time\
    \ data collection and transmission, and discusses the role of edge and fog computing\
    \ in enabling real-time irrigation management systems. The review concludes by\
    \ identifying several promising areas for future research."

    \ The agriculture sector is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, reﬂecting 26%\
    \ of its GPD and\n43% of the entire labor force. Smart and precise agriculture\
    \ is the key to producing the best crop yield.\nMoreover, emerging technologies\
    \ are reducing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness for saving\nagricultural\
    \ resources in control and monitoring systems, especially for those areas lacking\
    \ these\nresources. Agricultural productivity is thwarted in many areas of Pakistan\
    \ due to farmers’ illiteracy,\nlack of a smart system for remote access to farmland,\
    \ and an absence of proactive decision-making\nin all phases of the crop cycle\
    \ available in their native language. This study proposes an internet of\nagricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) based smart system armed with a set of economical, accessible\
    \ devices and\nsensors to capture real-time parameters of farms such as soil moisture\
    \ level, temperature, soil pH level,\nlight intensity, and humidity on frequent\
    \ intervals of time. The system analyzes the environmental\nparameters of speciﬁc\
    \ farms and enables the farmers to understand soil and environmental factors,\n\
    facilitating farmers in terms of soil fertility analysis, suitable crop cultivation,\
    \ automated irrigation and\nguidelines, harvest schedule, pest and weed control,\
    \ crop disease awareness, and fertilizer guidance.\nThe system is integrated with\
    \ an android application ‘Kistan Pakistan’ (prototype) designed in\nbilingual,\
    \ i.e., ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’. The mobile application is equipped with visual components,\n\
    audio, voice, and iconic and textual menus to be used by diverse literary levels\
    \ of farmers.\nKeywords: smart farming; precision agriculture; IoT; sensor network;\
    \ semi-literate farmers; interactive\ninterface; User Interface (UI); Android\

    \ it is the primary food source\nand plays a crucial role in the global economy.\
    \ Pakistan is 79.6 million km2 and is home to a\npopulation of 192 million. The\
    \ contribution of the agricultural sector to gross domestic product\n(GDP) in\
    \ Pakistan gradually decreased to 19.3% in the year 2020–2021 from 22.04% previously\n\
    recorded in 2019 and generating employment opportunities for 38.5% of Pakistan’s\
    \ labor\nforce and valuable foreign exchange for the country [1–3]. It supports\
    \ the manufacturing and\nservices sectors of the economy by providing backward-forward\
    \ linkages in inputs-outputs\nmarkets and the most significant consumer of household\
    \ durables. Therefore, our agriculture\nsector can be considered an economic activity\
    \ in the country [4]. Farmers are facing issues in\nthe agriculture sector, so\
    \ it’s significant to research, develop of latest mechanisms, and adopt\nnew practices\
    \ to enhance production. Pressure on the agricultural system will increase with\n\
    the continuing expansion of the human population.\nMany areas of Pakistan are\
    \ trailing in agricultural productivity due to a lack of farmers’\nawareness,\

    vital for human development in these underdeveloped areas to utilize information\
    \ and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, machine\
    \ learning\n(ML), and deep learning (DL) to make such information more readily\
    \ accessible to farmers,\nsigniﬁcantly increasing crop production [7–13]. Climate\
    \ change and shortage of agricultural\nresources are also signiﬁcant concerns\
    \ for the downfall of agricultural performance resulting\nin food insecurity [14–17].\
    \ This lets farmers hamper soil with intensiﬁed pesticides, which\naffect agricultural\
    \ practices in a harmful manner. Finally, ﬁelds remain barren [18–22].\nThese\
    \ are reasons for crop failure, lower production due to diseases, unpredictable\
    \ climate\nchange, and loss of soil fertility [23,24].\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ traditional agriculture trends are insufﬁcient to increase agricul-\ntural growth.\
    \ Agriculture is also out of the reach of less conventional technologies. In\n\
    this context, digital agriculture, automation, and precision farming, now termed\
    \ smart\nfarming, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use intense techniques\
    \ to drive agricultural\nproductivity while minimizing its environmental impact\
    \ [25–27]. Data generated by smart\nfarming operations is provided by various\
    \ sensors that enable a better understanding of\nthe operational environment (interaction\
    \ of dynamic conditions of the crop, soil, weather,\nand environmental factors)\
    \ and the operation itself, leading to more accurate and timely\ndecision-making\
    \ [28,29]. Variability in climate and labor shortage is increasing continu-\n\
    ously, providing better insights for agricultural machinery automation. Remote\
    \ monitoring\ntechnologies facilitate farmers to access every inch of the farmlands\
    \ by creating virtual\nfences to monitor, detect and protect crops in real-time\
    \ [30–32]. IoT-based technologies\nallow farmers, among other things, to gather\
    \ data on plants’ environmental conditions like\nclimate change, soil fertility\
    \ level, humidity, temperature, and light intensity to monitor\nﬁelds and farms\
    \ remotely. These technologies assist farmers in having know-how and\nstatus of\
    \ crops anywhere and anytime [33–36].\nIn Pakistan, most farmers have android\
    \ phones [37–41] but are regrettably under-\nutilized. Our preliminary literature\
    \ study compelled us to work to facilitate farmers for\nagriculture automation,\
    \ recommendations, and guidelines in their local language, i.e.,\nUrdu, by using\
    \ the internet of agricultural things (IoAT), also known as agricultural\ninternet\
    \ of things (Ag-IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies with transliteration\
    \ and\nvoice-speech support in the local language. IoAT is the network of complex\
    \ and diverse\nagricultural objects that compute, process, and recommend solutions\
    \ intelligently based on\ndata generated from every connectable thing [42].\n\
    Previous research shows that using graphical cues, audio, speech, and video in\
    \ mobile\ninterfaces helps low-literates better adapt [43,44]. Field study experiences\
    \ reﬂect that low-\nliterates feel more challenged in understanding and interpreting\
    \ textual information than\ntheir literate peers [45]. In our research, we try\
    \ to accommodate such users by introducing\naudio, speech, Urdu language support,\
    \ and an interactive graphical interface. Researchers\nalso talked about the improvements\
    \ in information dissemination systems for less literate\nfarmers via different\
    \ means [46–50]. However, none considered interface design and\nUrdu language-based\
    \ real-time updates about agricultural guidelines using the android\napplication\
    \ and user preferences. Our choice of Urdu in this work was made by observing\n\
    that 87% of farmers preferred Urdu as a medium of information dissemination [51].\
    \ Our\nresearch is an extended form of [52–54] and primarily focuses on developing\
    \ an IoT-based\nand user-friendly system with these utilities.\n1.1. Rationale\n\
    This section reﬂects the ﬁndings and an evaluation report on information found\
    \ in\nthe literature relevant to our research domain. It represents the overview\
    \ of different ap-\nproaches used by other researchers. Integrating the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural\nsystem has led to the internet of Agricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) and advanced computing\ntechniques. The researchers applied this\
    \ to obtain maximum beneﬁts and also to improve\nthe production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and IoT [55]. The agriculture domain is\nexperiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by cloud technology, IoT, Edge and\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n3 of 23\nfog computing, sensors, IoT, and big data\
    \ [56]. A proposal was presented for agriculture\napplications by investigating\
    \ integrated platforms, including cloud computing, IoT, and\ndata mining techniques\
    \ [57]. An IoT-based smart agricultural system was developed using\ndeep learning\
    \ combined with a cloud environment comprised of four layers: data collection,\n\
    edge computing, data transmission, and cloud computing layer [58]. A scalable\
    \ network-\nbased architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agricultural\
    \ farms in rural areas\nusing IoT-based wiﬁ, long-distance network, and fog computing\
    \ [59]. Agricultural data\nanalytics employed with IoT has transformed from speciﬁc\
    \ crops to any kind of crop. The\ndeveloped system could support various applications,\
    \ from controlling and monitoring the\ncrops to promoting them to market [60].\n\
    Literacy is the ability to read and write simple statements [61]. Illiteracy,\
    \ low education,\nand computer illiteracy are signiﬁcant concerns in developing\
    \ countries like Pakistan.\nStudies indicate that user interface (UI) would be\
    \ designed differently for literate, low-\nliterate, and illiterate users. A user\
    \ interface should also consider the cultural context, such\nas language and images.\
    \ The non-textual interface is more user-friendly than the textual\none for illiterate\
    \ users [62].\nThe inability to read and write and the illiteracy of small farmers\
    \ make them vulnerable\nto various workers and cause human health risks [63].\
    \ Previous research inferred that\ncomplex hierarchy and multi-screens become\
    \ difﬁcult for low-literates to understand\nhelpful information, so the visuals,\
    \ audio, video, speech, icons, and images are a better\napproach to passing complex\
    \ data and information to mobile users [64]. The research\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on some user interface (UI) design guidelines for illiterate and semi-\nliterate\
    \ users that can help take advantage of information and communication technologies\n\
    ICT [51]. The most powerful design factors that should be incorporated into a\
    \ user interface\n(UI) for low-literate users are localization and graphics [65].\
    \ An android application with\naudio, textual, and visual components was designed\
    \ for farmers with diverse literacy\nlevels. It could facilitate them regarding\
    \ vital weather information [45]. Pakistani farmers\ntypically rely on traditional\
    \ sources of information, which could be a reason for their\ninformation deﬁciency.\
    \ Data analysis indicated that farmers had diverse demographic\nconditions, but\
    \ primary among them is the ordinary level of education (52.4% illiterate).\n\
    A high level of information deﬁciency was observed among farmers regarding fertilizers\n\
    application, seed rate, disease diagnosis, pests, and insects’ identiﬁcation,\
    \ and a medium\nlevel of lack in information regarding the selection of varieties,\
    \ harvesting, and pets’\nmanagement was observed [66]. Providing information access\
    \ to low-literate, linguistic\nminority, tech-shy, handicapped and marginalized\
    \ users using speech-based services is a\nviable solution. These services were\
    \ made the national weather hotline of Pakistan [50]. A\nsurvey data revealed\
    \ that farmers in the Vehari district of Pakistan have a low literary rate\nand\
    \ less technical knowledge. They are unable to read agricultural instructions,\
    \ unaware\nof pesticides persistence and toxicity (73%), unable to diagnose cotton\
    \ pests and diseases\n(86%), and unable to decide which crop to grow on cotton\
    \ adjacent farms (100%) [67]. The\nresearch was conducted to study knowledge,\
    \ attitude, and practices regarding pesticide\nusage by vegetable growers in three\
    \ districts; Dadu, Larkana, and Shikarpur of Sindh,\nPakistan. Results show that\
    \ most vegetable growers (40.90%) have low primary education\nliteracy, and 27.27%\
    \ possess a middle pass. That’s why most growers are unfamiliar with\npest and\
    \ insect damage indications and the safe handling of pesticides [68]. Pakistani\n\
    farmers’ awareness of the damaging effects of different pesticides can lead to\
    \ integrated\nand smart pest control and management [69]. Research ﬁndings reﬂect\
    \ farmers’ behavior\nand a low tendency towards reading the labels of the pesticides\
    \ due to low education,\nadvanced age, usage of too technical language, illegible\
    \ fonts, and unclear texts [70]. In [71],\nthe authors developed a basic interactive\
    \ voice response (IVR) system for agro-information\ndissemination, such as fertilizer,\
    \ pesticide information, and weather forecast. In terms\nof usability and information\
    \ extraction, their study reﬂected that simple menu-based\nnavigation interfaces\
    \ are relatively easy to use and understand.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n4 of\
    \ 23\nA remote agricultural monitoring platform was proposed in [72] after a detailed\n\
    literature study. Cyber security-based precision farming conceptual architecture\
    \ was\npresented in [73] for the frost prediction in peach production by analyzing\
    \ data captured\nby sensors implanted around an orchard. IoT-based precision farming\
    \ comprises multiple\ncontrol and monitoring applications like monitoring water\
    \ needs according to climate\nconditions, analyzing soil patterns, monitoring\
    \ crops disease and pest attacks, and assessing\noptimum time for planting, harvesting,\
    \ and tracking [74,75].\nAquaAgro offers IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) enabled\
    \ solutions for precision\nfarming. Using a software or app embedded hardware,\
    \ the predictions will be made for\nthe Irrigation scheduling, Fertilizer requirement,\
    \ Pest attack prediction, and Plant disease\ndetection. The essential four services\
    \ that AquaAgro provides are irrigation scheduling,\nFertilizer requirement, Pest\
    \ attack prediction, and Plant disease detection. They have\nreceived an overwhelming\
    \ response from the people [76]. An android mobile application\nnamed ‘Mentha\
    \ Mitra’ was developed with an interactive interface with bilingual (Hindi\nand\
    \ English) for menthol mint growers [77]. Android application provides scientiﬁc\
    \ e-\nadvisories on crop-related diseases, high-yield varieties, pests, insects,\
    \ and improved\ndistillation units.\nAn IoT-based wireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ framework was proposed to monitor\ncrops smartly by analyzing environmental\
    \ factors [78]. In [79], the authors utilized the\nbeneﬁts of IoT for the implementation\
    \ of precision agriculture by sensing required param-\neters from the ﬁeld and\
    \ making suitable decisions such as activation and deactivation of\nirrigation\
    \ valves. Parameters include soil moisture, temperature and light intensity, etc.\n\
    Sensors could also send the gathered data to the cloud, and an Android application\
    \ was\ndeveloped to access these parameters. An expert IoT-based system relies\
    \ on the stored\nknowledge base and real-time data for farmer recommendations\
    \ [80]. This system will help\nin proactive and reactive tasks to a minimum the\
    \ loss of water. Farooq et al. [81] performed\na comprehensive literature study\
    \ on state-of-the-art techniques in smart farming. They\ndiscussed agriculture\
    \ networks, platforms, architecture, and topologies to help farmers\nto enhance\
    \ the corps’ productivity. This survey paper shows that Government and many\n\
    other stakeholders are interested in deploying IoT in Pakistan’s agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ To in-\ncrease agricultural productivity, the authors suggested that collaboration\
    \ between allied\nand agriculture activities can be built by integrating big data\
    \ into climate-smart agriculture\nwith resource utilization [82].\nIn [83], the\
    \ authors are more concerned about the water supply to the plants. They\nproposed\
    \ a system in which a farmer can water the plants with a push of a button on his\n\
    phone when he is out of the station. Machine learning algorithms and radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags detect and measure moisture and humidity. Internationally,\n\
    many studies [12,84–86] have been conducted to improve agricultural processes\
    \ based on\nsoil fertility level, crops, weather patterns, and fertilizers. These\
    \ studies used IoT, Global\nPosition Systems (GPS), Global information systems\
    \ (GIS), Wireless Sensor Networks\n(WSN), and many machine learning techniques.\
    \ The implementation of studies results in\nincreased proﬁtability and self-sufﬁciency.\
    \ IoT enabled decision support systems based on\nreal-time farm sensors data,\
    \ improving the water consumption by crops [87–89]. Authors\nin [90] provided\
    \ the real-time farm data, weather, and crops data to a Penman-Monteith\nand crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ model to produce recommendations about irrigation schedules. An\nintelligent\
    \ approach for diagnosing crop disease was proposed in [91], capable of working\n\
    with android devices equipped with fuzzy decision-making at the backend. The system\n\
    interacts with farmers in their native language of Urdu for crop disease diagnosing.\
    \ ‘Padi2U’\nis an android application developed for farmers to manage paddy ﬁelds.\
    \ It provides\nguidelines related to paddy varieties, planting schedule, pest,\
    \ disease, weed, weather\nforecast, and yield information in their native language\
    \ ‘Malay’ [92]. In [93], the authors\ndeveloped an application named ‘BLYNK’ to\
    \ control the IoT-based hardware remotely. The\npurpose of ‘BLYNK’ was to automate\
    \ irrigation and fertilizer supply to farms. Their results\nreﬂect approximately\
    \ 50% water saving and a 35% increase in yield. Irrigation monitoring\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 1277\n5 of 23\nand automatic control systems were developed using\
    \ fuzzy decision support to generate a\nmoisture content distribution map of soil\
    \ and enhance affectivity [53,94–98].\nSoil having an essential quantity of macro\
    \ and micro-nutrients would be capable of\ncultivating different crops. The soil’s\
    \ lack of signiﬁcant nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,\nand Potassium) declines\
    \ crops’ cultivation, growth, and yield. To increase crop production,\nthe suitability\
    \ of a speciﬁc crop to be planted can be recommended by exploiting the soil’s\n\
    macronutrients [99–103]. Soil pH level is the major parameter for measuring soil\
    \ macronu-\ntrients (N, P, and K) and some of the micronutrients [104–108]. Smart\
    \ agro farms [109] use\nsolar power and a low-cost smart system, a perfect combination\
    \ of IoT, data mining, and\nAndroid application. The system monitors and extracts\
    \ a farm’s environmental factors\nsuch as soil moisture, humidity, and weather\
    \ and temperature parameters via data mining\nmodules, and provides optimized\
    \ guidance regarding crop cultivation, irrigation, and\nweather forecast in the\
    \ English language.\n1.2. Objectives and Hypotheses\nThe proposed system obtains\
    \ agricultural data through implanted IoT sensors, such\nas pH, soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The Internet plays a mediatory role in\ncommunication\
    \ and data exchange. We integrated agricultural data acquired from im-\nplanted\
    \ IoT devices with the cloud platform. Data is processed in a decision-making\
    \ system\nbased on learning prediction rules in conjunction with a rule-based\
    \ engine. Generally, a\nfarmer requires guidelines, even from the crop selection\
    \ phase to the harvesting stage. As\npresented in Figure 1, to facilitate low\
    \ literate farmers at each of these steps in their native\nlanguage, we performed\
    \ the following research objectives:\n•\nInvestigated traditional techniques and\
    \ systems with different agricultural interfaces\nto ﬁnd a research gap.\n•\n\
    Design and develop an interface in an easy-to-use format and Urdu for low-literate\n\
    farmers to facilitate their awareness and guidelines in their native language.\n\
    •\nDesign and develop a mechanism for measuring soil fertility of speciﬁc land\
    \ to recom-\nmend suitable crops according to soil fertility using fuzzy logic.\n\
    •\nProvide crops cultivation schedule, crop harvest schedule, automated irrigation\
    \ pro-\ncess, and watering guidelines to farmers.\n•\nFacilitate farmers concerning\
    \ guidelines for weeds and their eradication, pest attacks,\nand awareness of\
    \ best pesticides, crop diseases, and suitable fertilizers.\nAgriculture 2022,\

    \ most farmers are unfamiliar with the latest practices of\nagriculture as they\
    \ are not facilitated with new technologies to access agricultural information\n\
    and thus rely on traditional methods to grow their crops. Related studies indicate\
    \ that there is\nno such smart system providing an interactive interface to a\
    \ low literate or illiterate farmer\nand guidelines from the crop selection phase\
    \ to the harvesting stage. Significant barriers to\naccessing modern information\
    \ systems are the low literacy of farmers, the non-availability of\nlocal-language\
    \ information systems, and systems with fewer features. Our research identified\n\
    that it is essential to equip rural and semi-literate or illiterate farmers with\
    \ updated information\nthrough ICT, IoT, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, and\
    \ Machine learning techniques, and\nprovide them guidance in almost every phase\
    \ of the crop cycle. It is necessary to develop\nUrdu-language-based information\
    \ smart systems to enhance farmers’ comprehension, crop\nproduction, and sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nProposed System Design and Architecture\nThe overall design and\
    \ architecture of the solution proposed to cover smart agriculture\nare depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. It comprises three layers: crop (edge) layer, fog computing layer,\n\
    data analytics, and smart management at the cloud layer. The edge and cloud layers\
    \ are\ndesigned to be deployed respectively at local crop premises and remote\
    \ data servers. The\nintermediate fog computing layer comprises a set of virtualized\
    \ control modules in the form\nof Network Function Virtualization (NFV) nodes\
    \ that can be initiated along the network path\nfrom the farm facilities to the\
    \ cloud layer. NFV is a way to virtualize network services, for\nexample, firewalls,\
    \ routers, and load balancers that have traditionally been run on proprietary\n\
    hardware. The intermediate fog layer increases the versatility of deployed solutions\
    \ and\nconnectivity performances with the edge layer. At the crop premises, suitable\
    \ sensors like\nhumidity, temperature, soil moisture sensor, light intensity,\
    \ pH sensor, and actuators like\nwater pumps, valves, and activation of devices\
    \ for smart farming automation are deployed\nand connected with wireless nodes\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Sensors’ data is captured at the edge\nlayer through wireless\
    \ nodes and transmitted to the fog layer. This layered architecture lets\natomic\
    \ operations requiring high reliability and low latency between sensors and actuators\n\
    to be processed at the fog layer, such as executing irrigation mandates for a\
    \ specific time\ninterval. The fog layer subsystem comprises the farm’s operative\
    \ control like irrigation,\nfarm monitoring, energy management, etc. The fog layer\
    \ is responsible for data fusion and\naggregation to offload analytics functions\
    \ that are usually performed. The fog layer control\nmodules are virtualized through\
    \ NFV techniques that communicate with edge nodes via IoT\nprotocols like constrained\
    \ application protocol (CoAP) and MQ telemetry transport (MQTT).\nAs depicted\

    \ via actuators. Our\nsystem provides access to an Android application for farmer\
    \ facilitation with the following\nmain features.\n3.1.1. Soil Nutrient Analysis\n\
    With increased emphasis on precision agriculture, economics, and the environment,\n\
    soil analysis is a tool to determine areas where adequate and excessive fertilization\
    \ has\noccurred.\nSoil analysis is also used to monitor past fertility practices\
    \ to changes in\na ﬁeld’s nutrient status.\nNutrient availability can be impacted\
    \ by soil chemical and\nphysical properties.\nIn determining soil nutrient contents,\
    \ soil pH analysis is one parameter. Soil pH refers\nto the acidity and alkalinity\
    \ of soil measured on a logarithmic scale; thus decrease in 1 unit\nof pH value\
    \ causes an increase in acidity by a factor of 10. Small changes in pH values\
    \ have\nsigniﬁcant consequences. Table 1 represents the range values deﬁned for\
    \ soil pH.\nTable 1. Soil pH range values.\npH Level\nRange Values\n<3.5\nUltra-Acidic\n\
    3.6–3.9\nExtremely Acidic\n4–5.5\nStrong acidic\n5.6–6\nMedium acidic\n6.1–6.5\n\
    Slightly acidic\n6.6–7\nVery Slightly acidic\n7.1–7.5\nVery Slightly alkaline\n\
    7.6–8\nSlightly alkaline\n8.1–8.5\nMedium alkaline\n8.6–10\nStrongly alkaline\n\
    Measuring the acidity and alkalinity of soil is essential for analyzing the number\
    \ of\nmacro-nutrients present in the soil, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium\
    \ (K), and phospho-\nrus (P). Crops need these macro-nutrients in their growth,\
    \ thrive, and combat diseases.\nRemoval of bases from the soil due to harvested\
    \ crops, leaching, and acidic residual left in\nsoil due to fertilizers causes\
    \ an increase in acidity of the soil. Soil acidity affects crops and\nplants in\
    \ many ways, such as whether the surface pH is very high or too low, when the\n\
    efﬁcacy of herbicides and chemical reactions may be affected. Soil analysis is\
    \ the best way\nto check pH levels, and maintaining at least a pH of 6.0 is a\
    \ realistic goal. When soil pH is\nvery low (acidity is high) following conditions\
    \ occur:\n•\nSoluble metals, especially Manganese and Aluminum, may be toxic.\n\
    •\nThe population of organisms and their activities accountable for transforming\
    \ N, P,\nand S to plant-available forms may be reduced.\n•\nDeﬁciency of Calcium.\
    \ The soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC) is low.\n•\nSymbiotic N ﬁxation in\
    \ legume crops is signiﬁcantly impaired. The symbiotic asso-\nciation entails\
    \ a narrower range of soil reactions than does the growth of plants not\nrelying\
    \ on ‘N’ ﬁxation.\n•\nAcidic soil with less organic matter is poorly aggregated\
    \ and has poor tilt.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n8 of 23\n•\nThe availability\
    \ of mineral elements in soil may be affected. Association between soil\npH and\
    \ nutrient availability to plants can be depicted in Figure 3. The wider the blue\n\
    bar, the greater the nutrient availability. For example, for a pH range of 5.5–7.5,\
    \ the\navailability of P is highest and drops below 5.5. If the soil pH is 6,\
    \ an amount of P\napplied to it will be more available than if the same amount\
    \ is used in soil with a pH\nless than 5.5. Soil with high pH (>7.4) reduces several\
    \ nutrients such as Fe, Mn, Zn,\nand P, which is not economical for growing agronomic\
    \ crops.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n9 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 3.\
    \ Chart representing availability of soil nutrients in terms of soil pH [110].\
    \  \nMacronutrients are essential for plant growth and an excellent overall plant\
    \ state. The \nprimary macronutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium\
    \ (K). Nitrogen is \na principal constituent of several essential plant substances\
    \ necessary for plant develop-\nment, energy metabolism, and protein synthesis.\
    \ Phosphorus is involved in vital plant \nprocesses. Unlike other macronutrients,\
    \ potassium is not included in the composition of \nessential metabolism components.\
    \ Still, it substantially occurs in all plant parts for enzyme \nactivities. Soil\
    \ pH sensor and soil moisture sensor measure the soil characteristics fre-\nquently\
    \ so that a farmer can monitor the status of crops in a healthy range in real-time\

    \ It is necessary to ensure its sustainable growth\nover the years. We studied\
    \ traditional trends followed by farmers and investigated why\nproductivity lags.\
    \ The key barriers are information inadequacies, lack of information\nsystems\
    \ for illiterates or less-literates, and lack of a system that provides guidance\
    \ at\nevery stage of the crop cycle. This study was carried out to provide a smart\
    \ advisory\nsystem for illiterate and semi-literate farmers of Pakistan that could\
    \ provide them guidance\nfrom crop selection to the harvest stage phase. In this\
    \ research work, we built a cost-\neffective smart system equipped with multiple\
    \ sensors and devices related to the internet\nof things (IoT) technologies. We\
    \ also developed an android application named ‘Kistan\nPakistan’ that allows illiterate\
    \ and low-literate farmers to manage their farms remotely. The\ninterface of the\
    \ android application is interactive due to its visual, audio, voice, and iconic\n\
    components. The proposed solution is applicable globally as all information and\
    \ guidelines\nare disseminated in both the ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’ languages. Edge-cloud\
    \ computing\ndelivers more accurate guidelines in less time and in almost every\
    \ phase of the agricultural\ncycle, increasing productivity and making the agricultural\
    \ ecosystem more robust. We\nexperimented on a small-scale farm, but the results\
    \ reﬂect that it will be efﬁcient for medium\nto large-scale ﬁelds.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Farmers'
  verbatim_quote1: Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather,
    pests, and diseases can provide a wealth of information that can be used to optimize
    irrigation schedules and improve crop yields. However, collecting and transmitting
    this data in a timely and reliable manner can be a challenge, especially in large-scale
    or remote farming operations.
  verbatim_quote2: Edge and fog computing can play a key role in enabling real-time
    irrigation management systems by providing a way to collect, process, and store
    data close to the source. This can reduce latency and improve reliability, which
    is critical for applications that require real-time decision-making.

  analysis: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proven
    to be better in providing high-accuracy quality results compared to other algorithms

    \ is a new agricultural system which aims to utilize the limited access to\nland,\
    \ especially in big cities. Vertical agriculture is the answer to meet the challenges\
    \ posed by land\nand water shortages, including urban agriculture with limited\
    \ access to land and water. This research\nstudy uses the Preferred Reporting\
    \ for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) item as\none of the literary\
    \ approaches. PRISMA is one way to check the validity of articles for a literature\n\
    review or a systematic review resulting from this paper. One of the aims of this\
    \ study is to review\na survey of scientiﬁc literature related to vertical farming\
    \ published in the last six years. Artiﬁcial\nintelligence with machine learning,\
    \ deep learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in supporting\nprecision agriculture\
    \ has been optimally utilized, especially in its application to vertical farming.\
    \ The\nresults of this study provide information regarding all of the challenges\
    \ and technological trends in\nthe area of vertical agriculture, as well as exploring\
    \ future opportunities.\nKeywords: vertical farming; artificial intelligence;\
    \ machine learning; deep learning; internet of things (IoT)\n1. Introduction\n\
    The world population is increasing at an accelerating rate. According to a UN\
    \ report,\nthe world population is expected to reach around 8.5 billion by 2030\
    \ [1] and is even pre-\ndicted to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 [2,3]. The challenges\
    \ posed by reliable food demands\nwill be inﬂuenced by various factors, including\
    \ climate change, water scarcity, and limited\nland due to increasing urbanization\
    \ [3]. Research on agriculture has become an important\nfocus [4]. The smart farming\
    \ model is an essential step towards sustainable agriculture [5],\nwhich applies\
    \ intelligent technological innovations in agriculture by leveraging modern\n\
    technologies, such as the Internet of Things platforms, fog/edge computing, cloud\
    \ comput-\ning, and storage, all from the most advanced information and communication\
    \ technologies\n(ICT) [6]. Vertical agriculture is the answer to the challenge\
    \ of land and water shortages,\nincluding urban farming, which has limited access\
    \ to land and water [7]. One of the\ngoals of this research is to provide information\
    \ about agricultural land use by applying\nthe development of vertical farming\
    \ models [8–10], and intelligent system technology in\nvertical crop production\
    \ based on IoT [11–13], as well as processing data collected with the\nrole of\
    \ machine learning algorithms from various scenarios, such as intelligent irrigation\
    \ in\nvertical land technology, predicting yields, monitoring growth, monitoring\
    \ diseases, and\nproposing framework models on vertically integrated farmland\
    \ effectively. They are all\nconducted to change the paradigm of the traditional\
    \ agricultural industry into a modern\nagriculture format from the perspective\
    \ of precision and smart agriculture [2,14].\nMachine learning focuses on developing\
    \ computational artiﬁcial intelligence methods\nthat can access various types\
    \ of data (text, numbers, images, video, and audio), and is\nsupported by data\
    \ communication technology capabilities with data streaming speed\n(velocity)\
    \ using the data for self-learning [15].\nComputers 2022, 11, 135. https://doi.org/10.3390/computers11090135\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computers\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n2 of 19\nThe\
    \ study also presents a framework that maps the activities deﬁned in smart farming,\n\
    the data sets or features used in the data modeling, and the machine learning\
    \ algorithms\nused to analyze the features for each activity deﬁned in the described\
    \ stages of the chain\nand the farm sequences. Vertical farming offers many opportunities\
    \ to combine advances\nin genetics with advances in environmental modiﬁcation\
    \ and to produce a guaranteed\nquality and quantity of crops regardless of the\
    \ weather, soil conditions, or impacts of\nclimate change [10]. This enables the\
    \ opportunity of producing functional or specialized\nfood from staple foods through\
    \ environmental control and manipulation [16]. Vertical\nfarming has various advantages\
    \ over horizontal rice ﬁeld farming, observed from the\nperspectives of environmental,\
    \ social, and economic stability. New high-tech cultivation\nmethods, including\
    \ hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, largely challenge the need\nfor soil-based\
    \ agriculture for a wide variety of crops [17] and also present a viable option\n\
    for growing crops in urban environments where the geographic footprint is limited\
    \ and the\ndemand for on-time product delivery always increases [8]. A research\
    \ approach was taken\nto obtain the technology used to achieve this goal, at a\
    \ low cost, by utilizing the Internet\nof Things (IoT) [18,19] and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [20] on machine learning techniques [15]\nto help transform big data into knowledge\
    \ [21]. The IoT approach requires a set of sensor\ndevices, including temperature,\
    \ light, soil moisture, nutrition, and several other supporting\nsensors, which\
    \ are monitored continuously and obtain data through the data transmission\npath\
    \ where sensor data can be communicated wirelessly using microcontrollers and\
    \ wireless\nmodules to build intelligent and precise agricultural processes using\
    \ IoT [22].\nThe main objective of this research is to introduce a model of vertical\
    \ crop farming\nas an era of precision and intelligent agriculture as an embodiment\
    \ of intelligent agricul-\nture. Artiﬁcial intelligence methods are described\
    \ that combine the processing of big data\ncollected by IoT systems, the use of\
    \ machine/deep learning in different vertical irrigation\nscenarios, as well as\
    \ for yield predictions, monitoring growth and disease, and assessing\nsample\
    \ quality. Vertical farming (VF) opens up a new era of intelligent agricultural\
    \ engi-\nneering that has the potential to meet future food requirements. Looking\
    \ at the current\nagricultural trends, VF can utilize all agricultural IoT devices\
    \ in multiple dimensions.\nApplying agricultural technologies such as AI (artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence), machine learning,\nproductivity, and quality factors will increase\
    \ the efﬁciency of VF [23].\nIn Figure 1. The design of the proposed VF model\
    \ represents a new era of intelligent\nagricultural engineering. The application\
    \ of the Intelligent Internet of Things concept by\ncombining artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and machine learning algorithms, productivity, and quality\nfactors will improve\
    \ VF.\nIntelligent system agriculture refers to data-driven agriculture, which\
    \ can adaptively\nkeep up with future developments by utilizing new technologies\
    \ for the improvement of\nagricultural knowledge systems from the availability\
    \ of larger amounts of data [24]. With\nthe advancement of data management, smart\
    \ agriculture is growing exponentially, and\ngenerating relevant data has become\
    \ a key element in modern agriculture to assist users in\ndecision-making [25].\
    \ The concept of data-centric agriculture has been promoted in several\nformats,\
    \ such as Agriculture 4.0, Digital Farming, and Smart Farming, and was born from\n\
    telematics and data management combined with the concept of precision agriculture\
    \ to\nimprove agricultural operational accuracy [26]. IoT in the context of agriculture\
    \ refers\nto the use of sensors and other devices to transform every element and\
    \ action involved\nin agriculture into data [27]. IoT is a model for developments\
    \ in Agriculture 4.0 [28]\nand becomes one of the reasons why agriculture can\
    \ produce a large amount of valuable\ninformation. The agricultural sector is\
    \ expected to be heavily inﬂuenced by technological\ndevelopments and innovations\
    \ in IoT [6,29]. The big data concept applied to agricultural\napplications at\

    \ and LoRa\ncommunication. We have not discussed\nsome of the AI algorithms that\
    \ have\nbeen used in vertical farming.\nIn Table 2, many studies have been conducted\
    \ on using AI, machine learning, deep\nlearning, and IoT in vertical farming.\
    \ However, none of these studies focus on using smart\nvertical farming for food\
    \ crops such as paddy, corn, and wheat. Study research on vertical\nagricultural\
    \ land using artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning on staple\n\
    crops such as rice, wheat, or corn is one of the new opportunities for food crop\
    \ agriculture\nresearch on vertical land that can be controlled and monitored\
    \ at any time. Potential\nresearch gaps in vertical farming with artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are:\n1.\nThe challenges of indoor rice production compared to indoor vegetable\
    \ production.\n2.\nMore complex growth involves vegetative, reproductive, and\
    \ ripening phases.\n3.\nMore precise and complex water, nutrition, and lighting\
    \ management.\n4.\nMore extended production period from planting to harvest.\n\
    The novelty of this study is to address a new opportunity to study the development\
    \ of\nintelligent and precise indoor production for rice crops using vertical\
    \ farming. This is the\nnovelty of this research.\nBased on the distribution of\

    \ AI Research Trends in Vertical Farming\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) involves\
    \ the development of theories and computer systems\ncapable of performing tasks\
    \ that require human intelligence, such as sensory perception\nand decision making\
    \ [38] which are combined with Cloud Computing, IoT, and big data.\nAI, especially\
    \ in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) aspects, is considered one\n\
    of the main drivers behind the digitalization of smart agriculture. This technology\
    \ has\nthe potential to increase crop production and improve real-time monitoring,\
    \ harvesting,\nprocessing, and marketing [39]. Several intelligent farming systems\
    \ were developed that\nuse ML and DL algorithms to deﬁne various parameters such\
    \ as smart irrigation, lighting,\nweed detection, yield prediction, or disease\
    \ identiﬁcation. The type of vertical farming\nproposed to be a smart farm has\
    \ been reviewed in several kinds of literature as well as\nreviews conducted with\
    \ a focus on artiﬁcial intelligence [2,4]. One of the ﬁndings of this\nreview\
    \ is that machine learning and deep learning algorithms are proven to be better\
    \ in\nproviding high-accuracy quality results compared to other algorithms in\
    \ terms of accuracy\nwhen applied to various agricultural problems, such as disease\
    \ detection and identiﬁcation,\nfruit or crop classiﬁcation, and fruit counting\
    \ among other domains [40]. Figure 9 shows\nthe trend of the artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ approach based on a literature study.\nFigure 9 describes the research trend\
    \ of the vertical farming model structure taken\nfrom 68 related articles, under\
    \ research studies on types and structures of vertical farming\ndevelopment with\
    \ soil use, hydroponics, energy use, and indoor lighting systems. Study\nanalysis\
    \ shows that most of the research focuses on open farming systems and large areas\n\
    of land, compared to research on vertical farming systems. This is due to the\
    \ high costs\nassociated with developing intelligent technologies and systems\
    \ which typically also in-\nvolve hardware installation. The centralized network\
    \ subscriptions and software packages\nare required to facilitate data processing,\
    \ management of IoT devices and equipment, and\nknowledge exchange, which in turn\
    \ increases operational costs.\nBased on the literature study described in Table\
    \ 3, it was found that AI and ML tech-\nniques are still rarely explored in indoor\
    \ vertical farming systems, whether they are using\nsoil media or without, especially\
    \ for hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics [32]. There\nare only a few publications\
    \ listed in the table related to intelligent system models with\nML techniques.\
    \ Unlike the case with artiﬁcial intelligence in agricultural applications that\n\
    are not vertical land models, many explorations with machine learning in agriculture\
    \ are\nclassiﬁed into three categories, i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised\
    \ learning, and rein-\nforcement learning [34]. ML techniques and algorithms that\
    \ have been widely implemented\nin the agricultural sector are for prediction\
    \ of crop yields, disease and weed detections,\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n10 of\
    \ 19\nweather prediction (rainfall), estimation of soil properties (type, moisture\

    \ Vertical Farming\nIoT refers to interconnected computing devices, sensors, actuation\
    \ equipment, and\nmachines connected to the internet, each with a unique identity\
    \ and ability to perform\nremote sensing and monitoring [52]. IoT reference model\
    \ architecture has six layers, i.e.,\nphysical devices and controllers, connectivity/network,\
    \ edge/fog computing, data accumu-\nlation, data abstraction, and application\
    \ layer (user interface) [4]. The development of IoT\napplications in vertical\
    \ farms requires the support of hardware and software infrastructure\nas well\
    \ as communication media to ensure the interconnection of various heterogeneous\n\
    components [53]. This support is one of the vertical efforts of agriculture in\
    \ Industrial Tech-\nnology 4.0, namely the cyber-physical system (CPS) which refers\
    \ to a distributed system\nthat combines physical devices with communication networks\
    \ automatically. CPS bene-\nﬁts from various existing technologies, namely intelligent\
    \ agents, IoT, cloud computing,\ncomputer vision, big data, ML, and DL [54].\n\
    A wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered a type of technology used in IoT\n\
    systems. It can be deﬁned as a group of spatially distributed sensors for monitoring\
    \ the\nphysical conditions of the environment, temporarily storing the collected\
    \ data, and trans-\nmitting the collected information at a central location [6,55].\
    \ The results of the study that IoT\nis applied signiﬁcantly in agriculture, due\
    \ to its broad purpose and function in monitoring,\ntracking, tracing, agricultural\
    \ intelligent machines, and precision agriculture [52], which is\none of the main\
    \ research objectives in the smart farming approach. However, there are still\n\
    few studies that conduct some research on vertical agricultural land by considering\
    \ data\nreliability, interoperability, and IoT smart systems in the development\
    \ of the intelligent\nvertical farming system. This can be seen in Figure 10;\
    \ the trend of IoT-based agricultural\nresearch that focuses on the research of\
    \ IoT applications, monitoring (water, temperature,\nhumidity, pH), and lighting\
    \ systems.\nThe results of the studies from previous research on IoT applications\
    \ on vertical farms\nin Table 4 have been developed for the management of various\
    \ services on vertical farms.\nMost systems are still classiﬁed as prototype and\
    \ conceptual. Considerable research has\nbeen reported on greenhouses, but none\
    \ was found that is relevant to vertical farming.\nThe application of IoT in vertical\
    \ farming has attracted signiﬁcant research because its\napplication has potential\
    \ in various ﬁelds, such as the application of the CPS model to\nvertical farming\
    \ applications, and is a challenge because it requires the right hardware and\n\
    software [56].\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n13 of 19\nComputers 2022, 11, x FOR PEER\

    \ framework maps primarily onto three entities\nconsisting of a vertical land\
    \ smart model, AI/machine learning, and IoT. The literature\nsources were obtained\
    \ from 2016 to 2022 and an article processing approach was carried\nout using\
    \ PRISMA based on the search keywords in Table 1, which obtained 68 limited\n\
    articles indexed by Scopus in quartile 1 as many as 11, quartile 2 as many as\
    \ seven, quartile\n3 as many as 11, quartile 4 as many as six and no quartile\
    \ 33 articles. The distribution\nof reputation-indexed scientiﬁc articles at the\
    \ quartile level (Scopus), with details are\nas follows: Q1 16%, Q2 16%, Q3 10%,\
    \ Q4 95 and No Q 49%. The trend of the number\nof research and publications continues\
    \ to increase in the application of digitalization of\nvertical agriculture by\
    \ utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence. A review from the year that the trend\nis\
    \ always increasing, it can be seen in 2021 by 32%, which is described in Figures\
    \ 3 and 4. A\ntotal of 91% of the selected articles discuss vertical agriculture\
    \ as shown in Figures 5 and 6.\nThe distribution of the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ has been widely conducted and found;\nthis is seen in 47% of usage on machine\
    \ learning, 22% on robotic automation, and 13% with\ndeep learning approaches.\
    \ The IoT approach can be seen from the discussion of the sensor,\nmonitoring,\
    \ and LED applications which is shown in Figure 9, with a 28% soil research\n\
    object model, 18% hydroponics, and 22% lighting and irrigation.\nVertical agriculture\
    \ has great potential to meet the future food demand by strength-\nening the digital\
    \ farming system to support precision in agriculture with technology and\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence. The prospects of vertical farming in smart agriculture involve\
    \ the use\nof explainable artiﬁcial intelligence to monitor crop growth, forecast\
    \ crop nutrition, evaluate\nplant health, and control pests and diseases. The\
    \ described AI removes the traditional\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n15 of 19\nparadigm\
    \ concept of machine learning and allows for an understanding of the reasons\n\
    behind certain decisions [68].\nIoT integration in vertical farming is focused\
    \ on optimization and automation tech-\nnologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge,\
    \ products, and services to achieve high\nproductivity, quality, and proﬁt. Not\
    \ much research has been conducted and put forward\nregarding the incubation of\
    \ the IoT concept in the vertical agriculture sector. The main\nﬁndings of several\
    \ studies are presented in Table 4.\nVarious technological problems and architectural\
    \ problems have been addressed\nthrough the development of an IoT-based vertical\
    \ farming smart system, but most of these\nsystems are either in the conceptual\
    \ stage or in prototype form at this time. Its main focus\nlies in farm management,\
    \ irrigation control, crop growth, crop health monitoring, and\ndisease detection.\
    \ Some of these studies have also explained the implementation of IoT\nin modern\
    \ agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming—aquaponics,\n\
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). In addition,\
    \ most\nresearch focuses on addressing speciﬁc problems.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ approaches and digital technologies in vertical farming make\nagricultural processes\
    \ more environmentally friendly, and climate-resistant, signiﬁcantly\nreducing\
    \ crop failure and ﬁeld growth, and also reducing the usage of nitrogen fertilizers,\n\
    pesticides, and herbicides [35]. Based on the ﬁndings summarized in the previous\
    \ section,\nmachine learning algorithms and IoT smart technologies can be used\
    \ to increase the overall\nefﬁciency of a vertical agricultural production system.\
    \ However, in the review, the types\nof algorithms discussed in Table 3 have not\
    \ been mentioned much in vertical farming; in\nthis case, models on machine learning\
    \ or deep learning. The analysis shows that several\nstudies have focused on vertical\
    \ farming.\nThe research ﬁndings also show that most of the use cases are still\
    \ in the prototype\nstage. This is due to the complex design and management of\
    \ indoor farming, especially\nsoilless agriculture where the parameters and factors\
    \ (pH, air temperature, humidity, etc.)\nto be controlled vary [69] considerably.\
    \ By looking at Tables 3 and 4 in Section 3, it can\nbe seen that some of the\
    \ uses of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms from machine learning\nand deep learning\
    \ as well as technologies such as big data and analytics, wireless sensor\nnetworks,\
    \ cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in the ﬁeld of vertical farming have\n\
    not been signiﬁcantly explored. In addition, the costs required to develop smart\
    \ models for\nvertical farming are still expensive, which include deployment,\
    \ operation, and maintenance\ncosts [70].\nThe reliability of the sensor devices,\
    \ as well as the appropriate software applications\nare very important. This is\
    \ because IoT devices need to collect and transfer data based\non decisions made\
    \ using multiple software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and\ntransmission\
    \ can lead to erroneous monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data\n\
    loss, thus ultimately impacting agricultural system performance [71]. Standardization\
    \ is\nneeded to take full advantage of digital technology for smart vertical farming\
    \ applications,\nparticularly in device standardization. With standardization,\
    \ device, application, and\nsystem interoperability problems can also be solved.\
    \ The results of previous research on\nvertical farming applications have been\
    \ developed to manage various vertical farming\nservices. Most of the study systems\
    \ are still classiﬁed as prototype and conceptual. Then,\na lot of research was\
    \ conducted on greenhouses, and no investigation was found that\nis relevant to\
    \ the farming system that has been applied. There are still new research\nopportunities\
    \ to investigate and study indoor food crop production using smart and\nprecision\
    \ vertical farming.\n4. Conclusions\nThe results of this study contribute to research\
    \ that will be carried out around vertical\nagriculture to support Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. Vertical farming with AI, ML, and DL approaches\nhas been carried out in\
    \ several previous studies. The main limitation of this review is that\nit uses\
    \ only the prioritized online repositories for literature searches (Scopus, IEEE,\
    \ and\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n16 of 19\nScience Direct). Second, additional\
    \ keywords and synonyms can result in more research.\nSLR implementation with\
    \ PRISMA received 68 articles from 2016 to 2022 discussing the\nproblems and recommendations\
    \ for vertical farming presented in this study. The pattern\nin the vertical agriculture\
    \ sector is continually increasing. The results can be selected in\n2021 by 32%,\
    \ as depicted in Figures 3 and 4. A total of 91% of articles were chosen to\n\
    discuss vertical agriculture, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The distribution of\
    \ the use of\nartiﬁcial intelligence has been completed and discovered. This is\
    \ seen in 47% of usage\non machine learning, 22% on robotic automation, and 13%\
    \ on deep learning approaches.\nThe IoT approach can be seen from the discussion\
    \ of the sensor, monitoring, and LED\napplications shown in Figure 9, with a 28%\
    \ soil research object model, 18% hydroponics,\nand 22% lighting and irrigation.\
    \ The research questions posed are regarding the types of\ndigital technologies\
    \ used in vertical farming of innovative farming relationships, the level\nof\
    \ development and intelligent models adopted, and the challenges and barriers\
    \ to gaining\nopportunities from implementing intelligent vertical farming systems.\
    \ The added value of\nvertical agriculture has various advantages compared to\
    \ horizontal rice ﬁelds, as seen from\nthe three pillars of sustainability; namely\
    \ environmental, social, and economic, in the effort\nof world food security.\
    \ The results of studies from previous research on IoT applications in\nvertical\
    \ farms have been developed to manage various services on vertical farms. Most\n\
    of the systems are still classiﬁed as prototypes and mainly carried out conceptually\
    \ for\ngreenhouses. No relevant research on basic crop farming systems such as\
    \ rice, soybean, or\nwheat has been implemented. With the results shown from the\
    \ number of articles reviewed,\nthe use of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms from\
    \ machine learning and deep learning as well\nas technologies such as big data\
    \ and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical\nsystems, and digital\
    \ twins have not been signiﬁcant and explored in vertical farming. This\nis because\
    \ the costs required to develop an intelligent vertical farming model are still\n\
    expensive, including implementation, operational, and maintenance costs. This\
    \ research\nreveals that there are new research opportunities to investigate and\
    \ study indoor food crop\nproduction using smart and precision vertical farming.\n\

    \ and academic revolution in the technological world having billions\nof things\
    \ and devices connected to the Internet. Tese connected devices are heterogeneous.\
    \ Tey have diferent standards and\ntechnologies which communicate through diferent\
    \ protocols. Terefore, the implementation of IoTon a large scale is difcult due\n\
    to these heterogeneity challenges. Tis motivated us to overcome the scaling problem\
    \ of IoT by identifying the challenges from the\nliterature and providing solutions.\
    \ Tis study is based on the identifcation of the heterogeneous challenges with\
    \ solutions via a\nsystematic literature review. A total of 81 primary sources\
    \ were selected. After extracting and synthesizing the data, we identifed\n14\
    \ diferent IoT heterogeneity challenges. Some of the identifed challenges are\
    \ “heterogeneity of devices,” “heterogeneity in\nformats of data,” “heterogeneity\
    \ in communication,” and “interoperability issue due to heterogeneity.” Te identifed\
    \ challenges\nhave been analyzed from digital libraries and timeframe perspectives.\
    \ Furthermore, we have found a total of 81 solutions for those\nchallenges, with\
    \ at least 5 unique solutions for each challenge. In the future, we will categorize\
    \ the challenges and prioritize the\nsolutions by using a multi-criteria decision-making\
    \ problem.\n1. Motivation\nIoT is the expansion of current Internet services to\
    \ provide\nconnectivity to each object of this world. IoT has become the\nmost\
    \ prominent technology across the globe. It is an\nemerging technology that is\
    \ under development process\nwhere everyone is trying to interpret it according\
    \ to their\nneeds. Te implementation and interpretation of IoT face\nsome serious\
    \ challenges like security, virtualization, and\nheterogeneity. Heterogeneity\
    \ itself is a multifaceted chal-\nlenge hindering the large-scale implementation\
    \ of IoT vi-\nsion. It is due to these challenges that so far only limited\nimplementations\
    \ of IoT systems have become a reality. Tis\nmotivated us to perform a systematic\
    \ literature review to\nidentify those IoT heterogeneity challenges and their\
    \ solu-\ntions. Another contribution of this study is conducting a\ndepth analysis\
    \ of those challenges using the chi-square test\nbased on digital libraries and\
    \ timeframe.\n2. Introduction\nIn today’s technological world, IoT is considered\
    \ an im-\nportant advancement among the trending technologies. Te\nterm IoT can\
    \ be simply defned as the devices that can be\nconnected with sources of the Internet\
    \ [1]. In past years,\nthese devices have been constantly growing. Reference [2]\n\
    reported that around 500 billion devices will be connected to\nthe Internet by\
    \ 2030. In the physical as well as in the virtual\nHindawi\nScientiﬁc Programming\n\
    Volume 2022, Article ID 8626882, 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8626882\n\
    world, these IoTdevices will further interconnect with other\ndevices in a large\
    \ number, which will give new birth to the\nforms of interaction. Tis will enable\
    \ us to connect all objects\nof our surroundings in every corner of the world\
    \ in a single\nperiod. Tese objects can be sensors, smartphones, auto-\nmobiles,\
    \ industrial robots, refrigerators, thermostats, tablets,\netc. Te IoT is widespread\
    \ in both academia and industry. It\nis producing business opportunities in multiple\
    \ ﬁelds of\nindustrial markets, in both public and private sectors in a\nvery\
    \ broad range. Te industrial revolution of IoT will have\nbillions of heterogeneous\
    \ devices on the Internet of Tings\nin the near future.\nAt the other extreme,\
    \ the IoT vision of a large-scale\nimplementation faces serious challenges across\
    \ many di-\nmensions. One of the main obstructions in IoT is its in-\nclination\
    \ toward heterogeneity, and the heterogeneous\nnature might be in form of protocols,\
    \ device data format,\ncommunication capabilities of the devices, technologies,\n\
    hardware, etc. [3, 4]. It is due to these types of challenges that\nso far only\
    \ limited implementations of IoT systems have\nbecome a reality. For IoTto evolve\
    \ toward its vision of global\nimplementation, these obstructions need to be reduced\
    \ on\ndiﬀerent levels. To activate and provide the service, devices\nmust be connected\
    \ to the Internet. Te identiﬁcation of\nheterogeneity-based challenges that exist\
    \ at diﬀerent levels is\nneeded, and the current solutions adopted and/or imple-\n\
    mented by diﬀerent studies for handling heterogeneity in\nIoT systems need to\
    \ be highlighted. Te objective of this\nstudy is to conduct a systematic literature\
    \ review to identify\nthose IoT heterogeneity challenges and ﬁnd out the solutions\n\
    implemented by diﬀerent studies to handle IoT heteroge-\nneity challenges. Te\
    \ signiﬁcance of this study is that it will\nprovide the identiﬁcation and analysis\
    \ of heterogeneity\nchallenges in IoT systems and provide a summary of dif-\n\
    ferent studies that implemented various solutions to handle\nthe heterogeneity\
    \ of IoT systems. Another signiﬁcant con-\ntribution is that it will provide a\
    \ future direction to re-\nsearchers to make a better stand-alone architecture\
    \ aiming\nto tackle the heterogeneity challenges at diﬀerent levels of\nIoT systems.\
    \ As a result, IoT systems can be utilized and\nimplemented in a wide range of\
    \ industrial ﬁelds.\nTe organization of this paper is as follows: Section 3\n\
    presents a literature review related to IoT history, challenges,\nand heterogeneity\
    \ concerns. Section 4 explains the research\nmethodology used to achieve the objectives\
    \ of this research.\nSection 5 provides the result and discussion of IoT het-\n\
    erogeneity challenges and the solutions to those challenges\nfound in this study.\
    \ Section 6 concludes this review and\nsuggests future work.\n3. Literature Review\n\
    Because of the broad and complex nature of IoT, it has not\nyet got a single unique\
    \ deﬁnition that is acceptable to the\nwhole global community of users. Many researchers,\n\
    practitioners,\nacademicians,\ndevelopers,\nand\ncorporate\npeople have deﬁned\
    \ IoTin their terms, but the credit must be\nattributed to Kevin Ashton, an expert\
    \ on digital innovation\nwho for the ﬁrst time used and deﬁned it. According to\
    \ [5],\nIoTcould be nicely deﬁned as follows: a very comprehensive\nand accessible\
    \ network of intelligent devices which can act\nand react in accord with situations;\
    \ self-organize; share\ninformation, data, and resources; and be subject to change\
    \ in\nthe environment.\nIoT is growing and maturing day by day. It is the latest,\n\
    most ﬁne, and excellent concept in information technology.\nIt is a new paradigmatic\
    \ shift in information technological\nadvancement. Te expression “Internet of\
    \ Tings,” concisely\nshortened to IoT, is comprised of two words, “Internet” and\n\
    “Tings.” Internet uses a standard set of Internet protocols\n(TCP/IP) to connect\
    \ and serve a large number of users\naround the globe [6, 7]. It is a global system\
    \ of inter-\nconnected computer networks. Internet is interconnected\nnetworks\
    \ that includes a large number of local to regional\ncommercial networks that\
    \ may be private, government-\nowned, public, or academic networks. Tese networks\
    \ are\nconnected through a wide range of electronic, wireless, and\noptical network\
    \ technologies [8]. Te Internet is generally\ndeﬁned as a global network that\
    \ connects millions of\ncomputers. About 190 states of the world are linked through\n\
    the Internet that constantly shares data, opinions, and news\n[9]. According to\
    \ [10], there is an estimated 5,080,388,142\nInternet users around the world.\
    \ Tis large sum of users\nindicates that about 40% of the world’s total population\
    \ uses\nthe Internet.\nTe word “Tings” in the “Internet of Tings” can be any\n\
    object or person identiﬁable in the real world. Daily ne-\ncessities include electronic\
    \ devices that we come across as\nwell as daily used advanced technological items\
    \ like\nequipment and gadgets. In the near future, other certain\neveryday objects\
    \ are expected to connect with the Internet,\nwhich will lead to a period of extreme\
    \ expansion of the\nInternet known as the Internet of Tings. IoTsystem is based\n\
    on devices to sense, actuate, control, and monitor activities\n[11]. IoT devices\
    \ that are connected to other devices and\napplications can exchange data with\
    \ each other, they may\nreceive information from some other IoTdevices. To process\n\
    data, they may send the data either to centralized serves\nlocally or it may send\
    \ data for processing to cloud.\nTe National Intelligence Council (NIC) of the\
    \ United\nNations (UN) has considered IoT as one of the six “Dis-\nruptive Civil\
    \ Technologies” [12]. In this respect, we can list\nmany ﬁelds that are already\
    \ beneﬁting from the services of\ndiﬀerent architectural forms of IoT like transportation,\n\
    e-governance, smart city, smart health, life support, edu-\ncation,\nretail,\n\
    logistics,\nagriculture,\nautomation,\nmanufacturing of industrial products, and\
    \ management of\nbusinesses.\nEricsson [13] and Evans [14] have conducted surveys\
    \ and\nestimated that the use of the Internet will further increase,\ngrow, and\
    \ be boosted tenfold in the coming days. According\nto their estimation, about\
    \ 50 billion devices would have\nconnected by 2020. Tis expected number of new\
    \ Internet\ndevices shall be supposedly called constricted devices [15].\nTese\
    \ devices are small in size, are enclosed in nature, and\nhave a low cost. Tey\
    \ are speciﬁcally designed for the\npurpose of executing speciﬁc tasks like monitoring\
    \ the\nphysical environment. IoT devices are limited in terms of\n2\nScientiﬁc\
    \ Programming\ncommunication capabilities, processing power, and energy\nconsumption\
    \ due to their low cost. Tat is why these\nconstrained devices are very heterogeneous\
    \ in terms of their\nessential communication protocols, device data formats, and\n\
    technologies.\nDue to the heterogeneity of IoT, devices on the market\nnowadays\
    \ have diversity in communication protocols,\nmethods of network connectivity,\
    \ and resulting models of\napplication. It is not feasible to support such kinds\
    \ of di-\nversities in IoT, because developers typically lack the proper\nresources\
    \ required to have a grip on the speciﬁcs of the\nconstrained devices and network\
    \ [16]. Te main objective is\nto decrease, hide, or eradicate such a broad range\
    \ of diversity\nof the technologies, applications models, and protocols from\n\
    the users of IoT [17]. Because of the heterogeneous nature of\nIoT, it is one\
    \ of the newly emerging research areas which has\nrobust potential to bring a\
    \ paradigm shift in the under-\nstanding of fundamental computer science principles\
    \ and\nstandards of our future living [18]. Te demand for con-\nstrained IoT devices\
    \ is expected to increase; this problem is\nexpected to get worse in the future.\
    \ Terefore, there will be a\nneed to improve the integration of a large number\
    \ of\nconstrained devices in IoT. In this study, we have performed\nSLR aiming\
    \ to identify the heterogeneity challenges and\nprovide a summary of the solutions\
    \ adopted for those\nchallenges.\n4. Research Methodology\nA systematic literature\
    \ review (SLR) methodology is adopted\nto identify the heterogeneity challenges\
    \ in IoT systems,\nhindering a global IoT vision, and to ﬁnd solutions to the\n\
    identiﬁed heterogeneity challenges.\n4.1. Research Questions. Te ﬁrst step of\
    \ a systematic lit-\nerature review is to deﬁne research questions. Te research\n\
    questions of this study are mentioned in Table 1.\n4.2. Search String. Te second\
    \ phase of a systematic liter-\nature review is to ﬁnd relevant studies on the\
    \ research topic.\nWe identiﬁed digital libraries in which primary search was\n\
    carried out: IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink, Google Scholar,\nScienceDirect, and ACM.\
    \ We then deﬁned a set of keywords\nrelated to our research topic: “Internet of\
    \ Tings,” “IoT,”\n“heterogeneity,” “heterogeneous,” and “challenges.” Finally,\n\
    search strings were deﬁned and used to collect published\narticles related to\
    \ the research topic. Search strings are\nprovided in Table 2.\n4.3. Study Selection.\
    \ Te research selection process is to\nperform search in digital libraries based\
    \ on the tollgate\napproach considering the search strings. Figure 1 shows a\n\
    selection of articles using the tollgate approach.\nIn snowballing process, we\
    \ selected 9 papers from\njournals (IEEE TMC, TPDS, JSAC, ToN, TWC) and\nconferences\n\
    (SIGCOMM,\nMobiCom,\nMobiSys,\nINFO-\nCOM), the content of which is analyzed and\
    \ discussed in\nSection.\nInitially, 3854 papers were selected by applying search\n\
    protocol to the selected digital libraries. A selection process\nhas been applied\
    \ based on keywords, titles, duplication\nremoval, abstracts, and full text of\
    \ selected papers. We ex-\ncluded the papers of the following types:\n(1) Studies\
    \ published in sources other than conferences,\njournals, patents, and technical\
    \ reports\n(2) Research papers not published in the English\nlanguage\n(3) Studies\
    \ published before 2010\n(4) Studies that are not related to the deﬁned search\n\
    strings\nTo evaluate the quality of the included research papers,\nwe assessed\
    \ the following aspects:\n(1) Te study provides information about any challenge\n\
    related to IoT heterogeneity\n(2) Te study represents a clear solution to the\
    \ identiﬁed\nchallenge of heterogeneity\n(3) Te published study is from a stable\
    \ and recognized\npublication source\nFigure 2 shows a summary of paper selection\
    \ based on\ndigital libraries, and Figure 3 shows the paper selection on a\nyearly\
    \ basis.\n5. Analysis and Discussion\nIn this section, we have discussed the results\
    \ relevant to our\nRQs. For the analysis, we used the linear chi-square test of\n\
    association. For categorical values of predictor and outcome\nvariables, the chi-square\
    \ test is counted as more signiﬁcant\nthan other statistical tests. To answer\
    \ RQ1, identiﬁed\nchallenges/critical issues through the SLR are presented in\n\
    Table 3. We have found a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in hetero-\ngeneity challenges.\n\
    We set an occurrence percentage threshold of 30%.\nAccordingly, “Heterogeneity\
    \ of devices,” “heterogeneity in\nformats of data,” and “heterogeneity in communication”\
    \ are\nthe most critical identiﬁed challenges.\n5.1. Comparison of Challenges\
    \ Based on Digital Libraries.\nTable 4 shows the analysis of the identiﬁed challenges\n\
    based on digital libraries. We have Google Scholar, IEEE\nXplore,\nSpringerLink,\n\

    \ is a systematic literature review that reviews\nthe literature in the domain\
    \ of IoT heterogeneity. Te\nreview has been implemented using a systematic meth-\n\
    odology to select diﬀerent studies addressing the challenges\nfaced by heterogeneous\
    \ IoT. To conduct this study, a total\nof 81 research papers that are published\
    \ in diﬀerent digital\nlibraries from 2011 to 2021 were selected. For analysis\n\
    purposes, we divided this duration into two timeframes.\nOne is from 2011 to 2016,\
    \ and the other is from 2017 to\n2021. In this SLR, we have identiﬁed 14 diﬀerent\
    \ hetero-\ngeneity challenges that need to be addressed to implement\nIoTon a\
    \ large scale. Challenges with occurrence percentage\nof more than 30% are deﬁned\
    \ as the most critical ones. In\nthis study, we analyze the occurrence of those\
    \ challenges\nbased on digital libraries as well as timeframe. In this\nanalysis,\
    \ we found out that some challenges were more\ncritical in the earlier timeframe\
    \ than in the recent\ntimeframe.\nWe also found out that some challenges are still\
    \ critical\nin both timeframes. After identifying those challenges, we\nfound\
    \ at least 5 solutions for each identiﬁed challenge. Te\nsummary of those solutions\
    \ is given in Table 6. In future\nwork, we want to categorize the challenges and\
    \ prioritize the\nsolutions\nby\nusing\na\nmulti-criteria\ndecision-making\nproblem.\n\
